# SWORD HUNTER

*   If you take control of your opponent's "Sword Hunter" and destroy a monster by battle, the monster is placed into your Spell and Trap Card Zone and remains there when control of "Sword Hunter" is returned to your opponent.
*   While "Imperial Order" is active, you do not gain ATK for the Monster Cards equipped to "Sword Hunter".
*   If the monster destroyed by battle with "Sword Hunter" is Special Summoned from the Graveyard before the end of the Battle Phase, it is not equipped to "Sword Hunter".
