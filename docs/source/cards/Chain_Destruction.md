# CHAIN DESTRUCTION

*   You can activate "Chain Destruction" when you or your opponent Summons the monster.
*   If you activate "Chain Destruction" when a Fusion Monster is Summoned, monsters in the Extra Deck with the same name as the Summoned monster are destroyed.
*   "Chain Destruction" targets the Summoned monster.
*   If an effect is chained that increases the Summoned monster's ATK above 2000 or removes it from the field, "Chain Destruction"'s effect is still applied.
