# SPIRITUAL ENERGY SETTLE MACHINE

*   When this card is active, Spirit Monsters on both sides of the field do not return to their owner’s hand during the End Phase of the turn they were Summoned.
*   Discarding 1 card during your End Phase is a maintenance cost and must be paid each turn. You may decide to not discard a card, and destroy this card instead.
*   When this card is active, Spirit Monsters may still be returned to their owner’s hands by card effects such as "Penguin Soldier" and "Compulsory Evacuation Device".
