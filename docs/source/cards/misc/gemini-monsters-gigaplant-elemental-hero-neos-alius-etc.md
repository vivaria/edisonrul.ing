### Card Text

> This card is treated as a Normal Monster while face-up on the field or in the Graveyard. While this card is face-up on the field, you can Normal Summon it to have it be treated as an Effect Monster with this effect: \[...\].

### Card Rulings

*   Gemini Monsters are treated as Effect Monsters in the Deck, hand, when removed from play, and while their effects on the field are being negated.
*   Gemini Monsters are treated as Normal Monsters on the field and in the Graveyard.
*   The second Normal Summon ('Gemini Summon') of a Gemini Monster does not start a chain.
    *   This Summon can be negated (by "Solemn Judgment"), destroying the Gemini Monster.
    *   This Summon can be responded to with "Torrential Tribute".
    *   This Summon will trigger the effect of "Black Garden" / "Future Visions".
    *   Tributes are not required for Level 5+ Gemini Monsters.
    *   This Summon causes Continuous Effects to apply immediately.
    *   Acquired Ignition Effects can be used with Ignition Effect Priority (if the Summon was not negated).
*   Gemini Monsters that have been Normal Summoned again will lose their effects if:
    *   they are temporarily removed from the field (ex: "Junk Archer").
    *   they are flipped face-down (ex: "Book of Moon").
*   VS. "Skill Drain":
    *   Effects can be activated, and costs paid, even though they will resolve negated.
    *   You cannot perform the second Normal Summon of a Gemini Monster by its effect.
    *   A Gemini Monster can gain its effects with "Super Double Summon", but they will be negated.
    *   If a Gemini Monster gained its effects, it retains them while they are negated.
    *   If a Gemini Monster hasn't gained its effects, treat it as an Effect Monster without effects.

### On being treated as Normal Monsters

> _This card is treated as a Normal Monster while face-up on the field or in the GY_

- This is the effect of an Effect Monster.
- All Gemini Monsters are originally Effect Monsters, and are treated as Effect monsters in all locations, except while this effect is applying on the field/in the GY.
- It's an unclassified effect, meaning that it continuously applies (does not activate), and can be negated.

### Negating Gemini Effects

While "Skill Drain" is applying:
- Their effects are negated (but it does not "forget" that it has its Gemini Effect, if it gained one).
- They are treated as Effect Monsters (even if they weren't "Gemini Summoned").
- You cannot "Gemini Summon" them.

Once Skill Drain has left the field / is no longer applying:
- If the Gemini Monster was previously "Gemini Summoned", it gains its effects again.
- Their effects are no longer negated.
- You can "Gemini Summon" them if they weren't yet "Gemini Summoned".

### On Normal Summoning them:

> _While this card is a Normal Monster on the field, you can Normal Summon it to have it become an Effect Monster with this effect_

- This is not an effect. It is a "condition", and cannot be negated.
- It does not use the chain ("Pulling the Rug" cannot be activated).

When you "Gemini Summon" a Gemini Monster:
- You can't choose a new Battle Position for it to be in. You can't change its Battle Position after "Gemini Summoning it". You **can** change its Battle Position and "Gemini Summon" it after.
- It does not leave the field (equip cards remain equipped).
- It remains targeted by cards like "Call of the Haunted".
- If its level/atk/etc were altered by eg "Rush Recklessly", its stats remain altered.
- You don't tribute monsters for level 5+ Gemini Monsters.
- Cards like "Trap Hole" and "Solemn Judgement" can be activated, since it's still a Normal Summon.
- If the Summon is negated, it's not treated as being sent from the field to the GY.
