### Card Text

> When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, you can Special Summon 1 \[Attribute or Type\] monster with \[specified ATK / specified DEF / specified Level\] in \[Battle Position\].

### Card Rulings

*   These optional Trigger Effects activate in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
*   The "When... you can" structure means this effect can miss the timing.
*   Because this effect activates / resolves in the Damage Step, it cannot be negated by"Royal Oppression". Additionally, "Torrential Tribute" cannot be activated in response to the Summon.
*   These effects do not activate if the monster is removed from play (by "Dimensional Fissure").
*   These effects do not activate if the monster is destroyed by a card effect (ex: "Red Dragon Archfiend").
