### Card Text

> ① All monsters on the field and in any Graveyard become Zombie-Type monsters. ② Neither player can Tribute Summon monsters, except Zombie-Type monsters.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Continous-like Effect does not activate.
*   This effect does not target.
*   Monsters sent from the field to the Graveyard are treated as Zombie-Type throughout the process. A Psychic-Type monster sent to the Graveyard will not count towards "[Metaphysical Regeneration](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Supernatural_Regeneration)".
*   This effect only affects face-up monsters. Face-down monsters are unaffected.
*   The ② Continuous-like Effect does not activate.
*   The monster's Type is checked while it is in the hand. Even though a non-Zombie-Type monster will become a Zombie-Type monster on the field, it cannot be Tribute Summoned \[[REF\]](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=678883).
*   You can Tribute Set (this is not a Tribute Summon) a non-Zombie-Type monster \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=678883), [REF2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=851206&highlight=Konami+Ruling+Updates)\].
*   VS. "[Rivalry of Warlords](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Rivalry_of_Warlords)": You cannot Normal / Special Summon a non-Zombie-Type monster from your hand / Deck / Graveyard / removed from play while you control a face-up Zombie-Type monster.
*   VS. "[DNA Surgery](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/DNA_Surgery)": Whichever card resolved most recently applies its effect.
*   VS. "[Solidarity](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Solidarity)": The ATK gain applies if the original (printed) Type of monsters in your Graveyard match.
