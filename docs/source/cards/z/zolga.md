# Zolga

*   When your opponent Tribute Summons with your "Zolga" using "Soul Exchange", the controller of "Zolga" increases his Life Points.
*   When your opponent takes your "Zolga" with "Change of Heart" and Tribute Summons with it, your opponent (the controller of "Zolga" when it was Tributed) increases his Life Points.
*   When a Tribute Summon using "Zolga" is negated by "Solemn Judgment", you don't increase your Life Points.
*   The effect of "Zolga" can be chained to, and is Step 1 of a chain after a successful Summon. Effects like "Trap Hole" would be Step 2.
*   When you Tribute Summon with 2 "Zolgas", both "Zolgas" effects are activated.
