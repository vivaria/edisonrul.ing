> ① Once per turn, during your Main Phase, you can equip this card to "X-Head Cannon" or "Y-Dragon Head" you control as an Equip Card, OR unequip it to Special Summon this card in face-up Attack Position. ② While equipped to a monster by this effect, that monster gains 600 ATK and DEF. Ⓒ (A monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the equipped monster would be destroyed by battle, destroy this card instead.)
