# REIGN-BEAUX, OVERLORD OF DARK WORLD

*   This card has two separate effects. They form two separate Chains.
*   For the second effect of this card, you cannot choose a type of card that your opponent does not control. If your opponent has no monsters and no Spell or Trap Cards, the effect still activates, but disappears at resolution.
*   You decide whether to destroy all your opponent’s monsters, or all your opponent’s Spell and Trap Cards, when the effect resolves.
