# PHANTOM DRAGON

*   You cannot Summon "Phantom Dragon" if you do not have 2 Monster Card Zones that you can make unusable. However, "Phantom Dragon" can be Set or Special Summoned face-down when you do not have 2 Monster Card Zones to make unusable.
*   You cannot activate "Phantom Dragon"'s effect during the Damage Step.
*   If a face-down "Phantom Dragon" is flipped face-up, you will select 2 Monster Card Zones to make unusable. If none can be selected, the next 2 Monster Card Zones to become available will be made unusable.
*   "Phantom Dragon" can be Tribute Summoned if the Tributed monsters will create 2 Monster Card Zones that can be made unusable.
*   2 "Phantom Dragons" cannot select the same Monster Card Zones to make unusable.
*   Once a Monster Card Zone is chosen, you cannot change your choice to a different Monster Card Zone later in the Duel.
*   If you have 1 face-up "Phantom Dragon" while "Skill Drain" is active, when your opponent Special Summons a monster you can Special Summon another "Phantom Dragon" into one of the Monster Card Zones that was made unusable by the negated "Phantom Dragon".
*   If you take control of your opponent's "Phantom Dragon", you will select 2 Monster Card Zones on your side of the field to make unusable. If you do not have any available, the next 2 Monster Card Zones to become available will be made unusable.
