# Y-DRAGON HEAD  
> ① Once per turn, during your Main Phase, you can equip this card to "X-Head Cannon" you control as an Equip Card, OR unequip it to Special Summon this card in face-up Attack Position. ② While equipped to a monster by this effect, that monster gains 400 ATK and DEF. Ⓒ (A monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the equipped monster would be destroyed by battle, destroy this card instead.)

*   If "Y-Dragon Head"'s ATK is doubled with "Limiter Removal", and then "Y-Dragon Head" is equipped to "X-Head Cannon", "Y-Dragon Head" is not destroyed at the end of the turn.
