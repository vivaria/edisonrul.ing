# MIRROR GATE

*   This card does not target.
*   If your "Elemental Hero" monster is in Defense Position, calculate damage as normal, using its DEF.
*   If you activate "Mirror Gate", Damage Calculation is resolved as part of the resolution of "Mirror Gate"'s effect. You cannot activate cards or effects that could usually be activated during the Damage Step.
*   If the attacking monster or the attack target is removed from the field by an effect chained to "Mirror Gate", "Mirror Gate" resolves without effect.
