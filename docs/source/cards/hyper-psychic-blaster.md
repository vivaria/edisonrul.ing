> ① During battle between this attacking card and a Defense Position monster whose DEF is lower than the ATK of this card, inflict the difference as Battle Damage to your opponent. ② If this card attacks a Defense Position monster whose DEF is lower than the ATK of this card, gain Life Points equal to the difference at the end of the Damage Step.

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not start a chain.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect cannot miss the timing.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step, even if this card is no longer face-up.
    *   Compute the Life Points you gain based on the attacked monster’s DEF in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step. If the attacked monster is no longer on the field, refer to its original (printed) DEF.
