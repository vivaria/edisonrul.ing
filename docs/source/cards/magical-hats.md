# Magical Hats

> Activate only during your opponent's Battle Phase. ① Select 2 non-Monster Cards from your Deck and 1 monster you control. Shuffle those 3 cards and Set them on the field in face-down Defense Position. ⒸThe 2 cards selected from your Deck are treated as monsters (ATK 0/DEF 0) and are destroyed at the end of the Battle Phase.

*   This card cannot be activated unless you can Special Summon both cards. You cannot activate this card while a "Barrier Statue" monster restricts you to Summoning monsters of a specific Attribute.
*   This card can activate in the Start Step (before Attack declaration), the Battle Step before \[but not during\] the Damage Step, and the End Step (before Main Phase 2) of your opponent's Battle Phase.
*   The ① effect Special Summons 2 non-Monster Cards (they are revealed to the opponent).
    *   The Special Summoned Cards DO NOT HAVE Levels, Attributes, or Types.
    *   The cards are Special Summoned face-down, even if "Gozen Match" / "Rivalry of Warlords" applies.
    *   If the Special Summoned cards have Trigger-like Effects that activate when destroyed (ex: "Black Pendant", "Geartown", "Supervise"), they can trigger when destroyed by battle. Cards like "Statue of the Wicked" & "Dark Coffin" must be destroyed while face-down (by card effect) in order to activate, they do not activate if flipped by an attack and destroyed by battle.
    *   If "Light of Intervention" is active, the cards are placed in face-up Defense Position.
    *   If "Gravekeeper's Servant" is Summoned and "Necrovalley" is active, it gains 500 ATK and DEF.
    *   After Special Summoning non-Monster Cards, if this effect would flip a Trap Monster (ex: "Zoma the Spirit") face-down, it returns to the Spell / Trap Card Zone and is not shuffled face-down with the Special Summoned non-Monster Cards. Once Set, it cannot activate that turn.
*   The Ⓒ Condition does not start a chain.
    *   This can cause Trigger-like Effects (ex: "Geartown", "Dark Coffin") to activate when destroyed.
    *   A card removed from play by "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" is destroyed when it is returns.
