# AFTER GENOCIDE

> This card can only be activated during Main Phase 1. All monsters on both sides of the field that have been involved in damage calculation are destroyed during the End Step of the turn.

*   This card's title has been changed to "After the Struggle". If you have a card titled "After Genocide" its name is treated as "After the Struggle".
*   Even if the Battle Damage is reduced to 0 by the effect of "Waboku", "Kuriboh", "Sanga of the Thunder", etc., both the attacking and defending monster are still destroyed during the End Step by this card’s effect.
*   If you activate "After the Struggle", even a monster that performs a direct attack will be destroyed by this card’s effect during the End Step.
*   Note that "After the Struggle" will destroy monsters during the End Step, not the End Phase.
