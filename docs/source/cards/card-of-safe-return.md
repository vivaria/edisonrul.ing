# Card Of Safe Return

*   If your opponent uses "Monster Reborn" to Special Summon a monster from your Graveyard, you get to draw a card.
*   If the Special Summon is negated with "Horn of Heaven" or "Solemn Judgment" you do not get to draw a card.
*   Drawing a card for this card’s effect is optional, so if you use "Call of the Haunted" when you have no cards left in your Deck you do not lose the Duel.
