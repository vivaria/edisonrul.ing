# QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG

*   "Quillbolt Hedgehog"'s Special Summon effect is an Ignition Effect.
*   If an effect is chained that removes your only Tuner monster from your side of the field, "Quillbolt Hedgehog" is not Special Summoned.
*   If "Quillbolt Hedgehog" is flipped face-down after it is Special Summoned by its effect, it is not removed from play when it is removed from the field, even if it is flipped face-up.
*   If "Quillbolt Hedgehog" is Special Summoned by its effect and is later removed from the field while "Skill Drain" is active, "Quillbolt Hedgehog" is still removed from play.
*   If you Special Summon "Quillbolt Hedgehog" with its effect and afterwards remove it from play with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter", "Quillbolt Hedgehog" is not returned to the field in the End Phase.
