# GHOST GARDNA

*   "Ghost Gardna"'s second effect targets 1 of your opponent's monsters.
*   If a "Ghost Gardna" in your hand or Deck is destroyed and sent to your Graveyard, its effect activates.
*   If you control a face-up "Marauding Captain" and "Ghost Gardna", when your opponent attacks "Marauding Captain" you can activate "Ghost Gardna"'s effect, and the opponent's monster will attack "Ghost Gardna" instead.
