# JUNK ARCHER  
> ① Once per turn, you can select 1 monster your opponent controls. Remove that monster from play. During the End Phase of this turn, it returns to your opponent's side of the field, in the same Battle Position.

*   The ① Ignition Effect targets 1 (face-up / face-down) monster your opponent controls.
    *   If the target is face-down, it is banished face-down, and returns to the field face-down.
    *   The target returns, even if "Junk Archer" is flipped face-down / leaves the field.
    *   The target returns without starting a Chain. This is not treated as a Special Summon.
    *   If the target was a Token, it does not return to the field.
