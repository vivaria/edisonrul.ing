# IMPERIAL IRON WALL  
> ① Cards cannot be removed from play.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect does not activate.
*   Cards CANNOT activate if their cost / effect would remove a card(s) from play
    *   Examples: "Allure of Darkness", "Nobleman of Crossout", "Book of Life", "Bottomless Trap Hole").
*   If "Imperial Iron Wall" is chained, effects earlier in the Chain resolve as much as possible.
    *   Example: Player A activated "Allure of Darkness" and "Imperial Iron Wall" was chained. Player A only needs to reveal a DARK monster in hand. If they cannot, they discard their entire hand.
    *   Example: "Imperial Iron Wall" was chained to "Nobleman of Crossout", the targeted monster is destroyed but it is not removed from play. No cards in the Deck are removed from play.
*   "Imperial Iron Wall" trumps the effect of "Macro Cosmos" since it prevents an action.
