# Call Of The Haunted

> Select 1 monster from your Graveyard and Special Summon it in face-up Attack Position. When this card is removed from the field, destroy that monster. When that monster is destroyed, destroy this card.

*   This effect targets a monster in the Graveyard, and continues to target it while it is face-up on the field.
*   If the monster Special Summoned with "Call of the Haunted" is returned to its owner's hand by an effect, "Call of the Haunted" remains on the field meaninglessly.
*   If an effect is chained that removes this card from the field, the target is not Special Summoned.  
    
*   If "Royal Decree" is activated after "Call of the Haunted" has resolved, and later "Royal Decree" is destroyed, "Call of the Haunted" continues to target the Special Summoned monster.
