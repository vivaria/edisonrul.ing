# CREEPING DOOM MANTA

*   The effect of this monster prevents the activation of Trap Cards that can be activated when a monster is Normal Summoned, such as "Trap Hole" and "Torrential Tribute".
*   You can activate Trap Cards later in the turn.
*   You can negate the Normal Summon of this monsters with "Horn of Heaven" or "Solemn Judgment". (In which case the Normal Summon failed and the effect of the monster is not applied.)
*   The effect of this monster is applied to both players (so you cannot activate "Pineapple Blast" in response to your Normal Summon of this monster).
*   This is a Continuous Effect that you cannot chain to.
