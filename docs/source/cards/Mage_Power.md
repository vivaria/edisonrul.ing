*   "Mage Power" includes itself, Field Spell Cards on your side of the field, and monsters acting like Equip Spell Cards, such as Union Monsters.
*   If you control "Cannon Soldier" equipped with "Mage Power", and you activate "Limiter Removal", then the ATK of "Cannon Soldier" is (1400 + 500 + 500) x 2 = 4800.
