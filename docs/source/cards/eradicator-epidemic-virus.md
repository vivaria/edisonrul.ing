*   This card's cost Tributes a DARK monster with 2500 or more ATK.
    *   Face-down DARK monsters can be Tributed (like a Set "[Fusilier Dragon, the Dual-Mode Beast](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fusilier_Dragon,_the_Dual-Mode_Beast)").
    *   An opponent's face-down monster targeted by "[Soul Exchange](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Soul_Exchange)" cannot be Tributed.
*   You must choose Spell Cards or Trap Cards when you activate this card.
*   The ① Effect applies destroys all cards simultaneously.
    *   Any card treated as a Spell Card (by "Relinquished", a Set "Toy Magician") will be destroyed.
    *   If you declare Trap and your opponent's only face-down card is "Fake Trap", the cannot activate it.
*   Resolving the Lingering Effect does not start a Chain.
    *   You only check the cards on the field and in the hand when "Eradicator Epidemic Virus" is resolved.
    *   Only cards drawn are checked until the end of your opponent's third End Phase.
    *   If you draw a Spell / Trap Card(s) (ex: "Book of Moon") in your Draw Phase, it is destroyed immediately and cannot be chained (because this does not start a Chain).
    *   If you draw a Spell / Trap Card(s) by card effect (ex: "Morphing Jar"), resolve that effect first, then destroy any Spell / Trap Cards (whichever declared) drawn.
    *   If "Eradicator Epidemic Virus" is activated on your turn, the "first turn" lasts until the end of your opponent’s next turn.
*   The Lingering Effect of "Eradicator Epidemic Virus" DOES NOT DESTROY:
    *   cards added to the hand (by "King of the Swamp").
    *   cards you receive from your opponent (by "Exchange").
*   VS. "[Starlight Road](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Starlight_Road)":
    *   You CAN activate "Starlight Road" if at least two face-up Spell / Trap Cards (whichever declared) would be destroyed.
    *   You CANNOT activate "Starlight Road" if your two Spell / Trap Cards (whichever declared) that would be destroyed are face-down.
    *   You CANNOT activate "Starlight Road" if you have 1 face-up Spell Card and 1 face-up Trap card (even if there are others face-down) because "Eradicator Epidemic Virus" will only attempt to destroy cards of the declared type (Spell or Trap).
