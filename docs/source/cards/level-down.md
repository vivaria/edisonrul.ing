# LEVEL DOWN!

*   You can use “Level Down!?” on a “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” that is copying an LV monster. But since it is no longer copying the LV monster after it has been returned to the Deck, no monster will be Special Summoned.
*   You can use "Level Down!?" on "Armed Dragon LV10" to Special Summon "Armed Dragon LV7".
