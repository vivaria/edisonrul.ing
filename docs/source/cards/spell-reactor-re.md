# SPELL REACTOR RE

*   This effect does not negate the Spell Cardâ€™s effect; it merely destroys the Spell Card.
*   This is a Trigger Effect that activates by chaining it to the activation of the Spell Card. It does not target.
*   This effect can be activated during the Damage Step.
*   If the Spell Card cannot be destroyed when this effect resolves (example: it was destroyed by another card effect already), then you do not inflict 800 damage to your opponent.
