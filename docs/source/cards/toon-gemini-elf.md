# TOON GEMINI ELF

*   You do not have to have "Toon World" on the field to Summon or Set "Toon Gemini Elf", or to attack with it.
*   The Summon of "Toon Gemini Elf" is a Normal Summon, not a Special Summon (even if you have "Toon World" on the field). So you can Normal Summon it in face-up Attack Position, or Set it in face-down Defense Position.
*   You don't pay Life Points to attack with "Toon Gemini Elf". If your opponent has a Toon Monster on the field, "Toon Gemini Elf" does not have to attack it. However, it will prevent "Toon Gemini Elf" from being able to attack directly.
*   "Toon Gemini Elf" can attack directly, but only while "Toon World" is on your side of the field. (Unlike previous Toon Monsters, which can attack directly even without "Toon World".)
