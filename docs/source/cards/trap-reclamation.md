# TRAP RECLAMATION

*   This card can be chained to a Normal Trap Card or a Continuous Trap Card.
*   This card’s effect is only applied once, the first time the Trap Card it was chained to is sent from the field to the Graveyard for any reason.
*   If the Trap Card that “Trap Reclamation” was chained to is removed from play, or returned to the hand, etc. instead of going to the Graveyard, “Trap Reclamation’s” effect is no longer applied.
