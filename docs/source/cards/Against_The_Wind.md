# AGAINST THE WIND  
> Select 1 "Blackwing" monster in your Graveyard. Take damage equal to the ATK of the selected monster, and add it to your hand.

*   “Against the Wind” targets 1 “Blackwing” monster in your Graveyard.
*   If you control “Des Wombat,” you can activate “Against the Wind,” but since the damage you take becomes 0, you cannot add a card to your hand.
*   If an effect is chained that removes the targeted monster from the Graveyard, you take no damage and do not add it to your hand.
*   The effects of “Against the Wind” to inflict damage and add a card to your hand are considered to be simultaneous, although as a practical matter you take the damage first.
    *   This means that you can activate effects like “Numinous Healer” without missing the timing.
