# MONSTER RECOVERY

*   If you select a Fusion Monster or Synchro Monster, it returns to its owner's Extra Deck.
*   If you select your opponent's monster that you currently control, it is returned to your opponent's Deck.
*   You can select a Monster Token. It is removed from the field instead, because it cannot be shuffled into the Deck.
