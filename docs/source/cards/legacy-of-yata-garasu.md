# Legacy Of Yata-Garasu

*   When you activate “Legacy of Yata-Garasu” while your opponent has a Spirit Monster face-up on his/her side of the field and you select to activate the second effect of “Legacy of Yata-Garasu”, if your opponent chains an effect that removes the Spirit Monster from the field or flips it face-down, the effect of “Legacy of Yata-Garasu” will still resolve.
