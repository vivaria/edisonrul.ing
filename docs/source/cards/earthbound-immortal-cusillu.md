# EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL CUSILLU

*   Tributing 1 other monster you control is an effect, not a cost.
    *   If you Tribute “Lich Lord, King of the Underworld” for this effect, it will return to your hand.
    *   This effect is activated at the point in the Damage Step where monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the Graveyard.
