# Elemental Hero Divine Neos

*   Removing 1 "Neos", "Neo-Spacian", "Elemental Hero", "Destiny Hero", or "Evil Hero" monster in your Graveyard from play is a cost.
*   You can remove from play a Normal Monster "Neos" or "Elemental Hero" monster to activate the effect of "Elemental Hero Divine Neos". In this case "Elemental Hero Divine Neos" will not gain any effects.
*   If you use "Elemental Hero Neos" as a Fusion Material Monster, it can be used as a "Neos" monster or an "Elemental Hero" monster, but it cannot be used as both at the same time. If you use it as a "Neos" monster, you will still need another "Elemental Hero", "Destiny Hero" or "Evil Hero" monster.
*   "Neo-Spacian" monsters cannot be used as "Neos" Fusion Material Monsters.
*   If you remove "Evil Hero Dark Gaia" to activate the effect of "Elemental Hero Divine Neos", the original ATK of "Elemental Hero Divine Neos'" does not change.
*   If you return "Elemental Hero Divine Neos" to your Extra Deck by using "Contact Out", you cannot Special Summon the Fusion Material Monsters used to Fusion Summon it because the Fusion Material Monsters listed on "Elemental Hero Divine Neos" are not specificly named cards.
