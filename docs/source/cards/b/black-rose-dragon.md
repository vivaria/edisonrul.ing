### Card Text

> ① When this card is Synchro Summoned, you can destroy all cards on the field. ② Once per turn, you can remove from play 1 Plant-Type monster from your Graveyard to change 1 Defense Position monster your opponent controls to face-up Attack Position, and reduce its ATK to 0 until the End Phase.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates in the Summon response timing.
    *   If "Black Rose Dragon" activates its first effect, it is also destroyed.
*   The ② Ignition Effect targets 1 Defense Position monster your opponent controls.
    *   Removing 1 Plant-Type monster in your Graveyard from play is a cost.
    *   If the target is not changed to Attack Position by this effect, its ATK is not reduced to 0.
    *   If the target is in face-down Defense Position, its Flip Effect will activate after this effect resolves.
    *   A monster whose ATK was changed to 0 can have its ATK increased by cards/effects.
        *   The change is applied to 0 ATK.
