*   If you have 2 “Batterymen C” on the field in Attack Position, each of your Machines gains +1000 ATK. If you have 3 “Battermen C” on the field in Attack Position, each of your Machines gains +1500 ATK. (NOT +4500!!!)
*   A “Batteryman C” equipped to “Relinquished” is not in Attack or Defense Position so it will not be counted for the effect of “Batteryman C”.
*   If “Batteryman C” is changed to Machine-Type, it will itself gain the ATK bonus.
