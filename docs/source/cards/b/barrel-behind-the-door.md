*   You can activate Barrel Behind the Door against Trigger Effects like Lava Golem, Giant Germ, Relinquished (when it inflicts effect damage, since Barrel Behind the Door can be activated during the Damage Step because it is a Counter-Trap Card), Minar (when discarded), Parasite Paracide (when it inflicts effect damage), Bowganian, Mushroom Man #2, Reflect Bounder (when it is attacked), Shinato, King of a Higher Plane (when it attacks and destroys a Defense Position monster and sends it to the GY), Granadora (when destroyed and sent to the GY), Balloon Lizard (when destroyed), KA-2 Des Scissors, Needle Burrower, Atomic Firefly, Elephant Statue of Disaster, and Ameba.

*   You can activate Barrel Behind the Door against Flip Effects like Princess of Tsurugi, Fire Sorcerer, Needle Ball, Des Koala, and Lady Assailant of Flames.
*   You can activate Barrel Behind the Door against Jigen Bakudan. You don’t activate Barrel Behind the Door when the Flip Effect activates, you activate Barrel Behind the Door when Jigen Bakudan activates its effect during the next Standby Phase to inflict damage.
*   Barrel Behind the Door can't be activated against cards that don't inflict damage when the card resolves, such as Graverobber, which inflicts damage later.
*   You can activate Barrel Behind the Door against Ring of Destruction, and then your opponent will take all of the damage (the damage inflicted to him and the damage that would have been inflicted to you). The same is true for Tremendous Fire.
*   You can activate Barrel Behind the Door against Magic Cylinder. The attack will be negated and the damage transferred to the opponent.
*   You can't activate Barrel Behind the Door against effects if you don’t know for certain that they will inflict damage when the effect is activated. So you can't activate it against Dice Jar, Judgment of Anubis, Time Wizard or Ante.

*   You can activate Barrel Behind the Door during the Damage Step against appropriate effects, such as Princess of Tsurugi, because it is a Counter-Trap.
*   Remember that the effects that Counter-Traps are chained to must immediately precede them in the chain. So if you activate Ring of Destruction, and intend to chain Barrel Behind the Door to it, if your opponent chains something in-between (even an unrelated effect like Jar of Greed), then you can't chain Barrel Behind the Door because Ring of Destruction is no longer the preceding step in the chain.
*   If one player’s Giant Germ attacks another Giant Germ so that both effects activating during the Damage Step, they form a chain. If both players control Barrel Behind the Door, only 1 player can chain theirs. The turn player will be able to chain Barrel Behind the Door to the opponent’s Giant Germ because it is Step 2 of the chain.
*   If Bad Reaction to Simochi is active, you can activate Barrel Behind the Door against effects that would normally cause a Life Point increase, because they inflict damage instead.
*   If you re-direct damage to your opponent using Barrel Behind the Door, and you have Dark Room of Nightmare on the field, then Dark Room of Nightmare inflicts 300 more damage.
*   For effects like Princess of Tsurugi Thunder Crash, and Restructer Revolution, where damage is added up, Barrel Behind the Door re-directs the entire sum of damage.
