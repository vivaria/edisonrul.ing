# Blackwing - Silverwind The Ascendent

> ① When this card is Synchro Summoned, you can select and destroy up to 2 face-up monsters on the field with DEF lower than this card's ATK. Ⓒ You cannot conduct your Battle Phase the turn you activate this effect. ② The next time a "Blackwing" monster you control would be destroyed by battle during your opponent's turn, it is not destroyed, this effect only happens once.

*   You can Special Summon this monster with the effect of “Blackwing – Vayu the Emblem of Honor." You must remove from play a Level 7 “Blackwing” monster alongside Vayu to do so.
*   The ① optional Trigger Effect can only be activated when this monster is Synchro Summoned.
    *   This effect does NOT activate when Special Summoned by "Blackwing - Vayu the Emblem of Honor".
    *   You can activate this effect even if “Skill Drain” is active. However, the Ⓒ Condition will still apply, and you will not be able to conduct your Battle Phase, even though the effect was negated.
    *   If a monster targeted by this effect gains more DEF than Silverwind’s ATK, it will not be destroyed.
    *   If a monster targeted by this effect is flipped face-down, it will not be destroyed. Any remaining face-up targets will be destroyed.
    *   If this card is flipped face-down its ATK cannot be verified, so no monsters will be destroyed.
*   The ② Continuous Effect does not start a chain. You don’t choose when to use the “_next time a “Blackwing” monster would be destroyed by battle_” effect. It is automatically applied the next time your “Blackwing” monster would be destroyed by battle during your opponent’s turn.
