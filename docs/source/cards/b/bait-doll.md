### Card Text

> Force the activation of 1 face-down Trap Card. If the timing of the activation of the Trap Card is incorrect, negate the effect and destroy it. If it is not a Trap Card, it is returned to its original position. After this card is activated, it is placed into the Deck (not the Graveyard). Then shuffle the Deck.

### Card Rulings

*   You cannot activate this card if you cannot return cards to the Deck (by "G.B. Hunter").
*   As long as the activation and effect of "Bait Doll" are not negated, the effect of "Bait Doll" that shuffles it back into the Deck still resolves.
*   This effect targets 1 Set Spell / Trap card on the field.
    *   The target can be chained if its activation requirement is met.
    *   The target cannot be chained if it was just Set this turn (by "Dust Tornado").
    *   If this card activates a Trap Card with a cost, and that Trap Card's activation timing is correct, its owner must pay all possible costs. If they cannot pay the costs, the Trap Card is negated and destroyed.
    *   If "Bait Doll" targets a Set "Royal Oppression", the opponent can chain the "Royal Oppression" which will negate the effect of "Bait Doll" (it will not return to your Deck), or the opponent can allow "Bait Doll" to force the activation of "Royal Oppression", and "Bait Doll" will then be shuffled into the Deck and "Royal Oppression" will remain active since its activation timing was legitimate.
*   If "Jinzo" is face-up on the field and the effect of "Bait Doll" forces the activation of a Normal or Counter Trap Card, that Trap Card’s effect is negated and the Trap Card is destroyed. If a Continuous Trap Card is forced to activate by the effect of "Bait Doll" it will remain face-up on the field meaninglessly until "Jinzo" is destroyed.
*   If "Chain Burst" is active on the field and you use "Bait Doll" to activate the opponent's Trap Card, and its timing is correct, the opponent takes the 1000 points of damage.
*   When "Bait Doll" is activated, "Fake Trap" cannot be activated because there is no guarantee that "Bait Doll" will destroy a Trap Card.
