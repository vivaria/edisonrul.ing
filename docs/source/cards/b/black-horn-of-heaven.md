### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ①When your opponent would Special Summon exactly 1 monster: Negate the Special Summon, and if you do, destroy it.

### Card Rulings

This card can only negate the Summon of a monster while there is no ongoing chain.
It can negate:
● A Synchro/Xyz Summon
● The Special Summon of "Cyber Dragon" or "Machina Fortress" by its own procedure.

It can't negate:
● The Summon of a monster being Summoned during an effect's resolution, eg by “Call of the Haunted”.
● "Immediately after you do" effects, even if that effect was CL1.
