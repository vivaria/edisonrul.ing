### Card Text

> ① Effects of face-up LIGHT monsters are negated. ② If this card destroys a LIGHT monster by battle, it can attack once again in a row.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies so long as "Brain Golem" is face-up on the field.
    *   This effect only affects LIGHT monsters while they are face-up.
    *   The effect of “Sphere of Chaos” is negated if “Brain Golem” is on the field, so “Sphere of Chaos” is not treated as a LIGHT monster.
    *   If “Brain Golem” becomes a LIGHT monster, its effect is negated but all other LIGHT monsters are applied normally.
    *   “Brain Golem” only negates the effects of face-up LIGHT monsters on the field. If a monster is no longer face-up on the field, its effect is not negated by “Brain Golem.”
*   The ② Trigger Effect activates in Substep 7 of the [Damage Step](https://www.edisonformat.com/battle-phase.html) (End of the Damage Step) when monsters marked for destruction by battle are sent to the Graveyard.
    *   If “Brain Golem” destroys a monster that was LIGHT on the field but is no longer LIGHT in the Graveyard (because of “Scroll of Bewitchment” or “DNA Transplant”) it can still attack once again.
