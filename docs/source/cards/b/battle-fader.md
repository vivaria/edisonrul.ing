### Card Text

> ① When your opponent’s monster declares a direct attack, you can Special Summon this card from your hand and end the Battle Phase. Ⓒ If this card is Special Summoned with this effect, remove it from play when it is removed from the field.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Trigger Effect activates during the first substep of the Battle Step - Attack Declaration.
*   This effect to Special Summon can be negated by "Royal Oppression".
*   The Special Summon and ending the Battle Phase are all part of the effect which activates and resolves in the hand. This effect is not negated by "Skill Drain".
*   You cannot activate multiple copies of "Battle Fader" in response to a single attack declaration.
*   This effect has the same timing as cards like "Mirror Force".
*   Example: Player A declares a direct attack with "Light and Darkness Dragon" while Player B has a set "Mirror Force" and a "Battle Fader" in hand. Player B activates "Battle Fader’s" effect as Chain Link 1. Player A activates "Light and Darkness Dragon’s" mandatory Trigger Effect as Chain Link 2. Player B then activates "Mirror Force" as Chain Link 3.
*   This effect ends the Battle Step and moves players into the End Step of the Battle Phase \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=804828)\].
*   "Gladiator Beasts" that have already battled (participated in Damage Calculation) can still activate their effects during the End of the Battle Phase.
*   The Ⓒ Condition disappears when "Battle Fader" is flipped face-down.
*   If a card effect would remove this card from the field, it is banished by this Condition instead.
*   If this card is targeted by "Caius the Shadow Monarch"'s effect, no Effect Damage is inflicted \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=854459)\].
