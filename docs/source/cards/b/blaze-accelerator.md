# Blaze Accelerator

> ① You can send 1 Pyro-Type monster with 500 or less ATK from your hand to the Graveyard to destroy 1 monster your opponent controls, Ⓒ but you cannot declare an attack during this turn if you do.

*   The ① Ignition-like Effect targets.
    *   If the target is not on the field, you must still send a Pyro-Type Monster to the Graveyard.
    *   You cannot activate this effect unless you have a Pyro-Type monster with 500 or less ATK in hand.
    *   You cannot activate this effect simultaneously with this card’s activation.
    *   You can only activate the effect after this card’s activation is resolved, and it is face-up on the field.
*   Sending 1 Pyro-Type monster with 500 or less ATK to the Graveyard is part of the ① effect.
    *   It is not a cost \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=855510)\].
    *   This effect can be activated while "Dimensional Fissure" is face-up on the field. The Pyro-Type Monster sent to the Graveyard is removed from play instead.
*   The Ⓒ Condition prevents you from attacking during the turn the ① effect was activated \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=855510)\].
    *   This applies even if the ① effect failed to destroy the target.
    *   This applies even if a card/effect is chained to the ① effect that destroys "Blaze Accelerator".
    *   This applies to monster unaffected by Spell Cards / Effects (ex: "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6").
