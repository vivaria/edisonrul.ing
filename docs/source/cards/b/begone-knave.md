# Begone, Knave!

*   If "Gemini Elf" attacks a Defense Position "Battle Footballer", and "Gemini Elf"'s controller takes 200 damage, then "Begone, Knave!"'s effect will send "Battle Footballer" back to its owner's hand.
*   The effect of "Begone, Knave!" can be on a chain.
*   The effect of "Begone, Knave!" is applied to the monster that inflicts Battle Damage to the player, so if "Amazoness Swords Woman" battles a stronger monster, "Amazoness Swords Woman" would normally be returned to the owner's hand, but because she is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, she will not be returned.
