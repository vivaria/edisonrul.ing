### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① If a monster(s) is Normal/Special Summoned (except by “Black Garden”): Halve its ATK, also, if it is still on the field (even if face-down), you Special Summon 1 “Rose Token” (Plant/DARK/Level 2/ATK 800/DEF 800) to that monster's opponent's field, in Attack Position.
> ② You can target 1 monster in your GY with ATK equal to the total ATK of all face-up Plants; destroy this card and as many Plants on the field as possible, then, if you destroyed all of them, Special Summon that target.

### Card Rulings

Regarding Summoning Tokens with the ①:
*   A token is Summoned even if the monster's ATK can't be halved, as long as the monster is still on the field when the ① resolves (even if it's face-down/was summoned face-down).
*   Even if 2+ monsters are summoned at the same time, only 1 Token is Summoned.
*   The player who Summons the token is always the player who controls Black Garden.
*   The "owner" of the token is opponent of the player whose field it is Summoned to.
If you control Garden and activate Scapegoat, no Rose Token is Summoned.
If you control Garden, and the opponent activates Scapegoat, you Summon a Rose Token.

Halving ATK with the ①:
*   The ATK loss remains even if Garden leaves the field or later becomes negated.
*   If "Shrink" is later used on the monster whose ATK was halved:
Its ATK becomes half its original ATK, and in the End Phase, its ATK becomes its original (printed) ATK.

### Card Text

> ① When a monster is Normal or Special Summoned, except by the effect of “Black Garden”, halve its ATK and Special Summon 1 “Rose Token” (Plant-Type/DARK/Level 2/ATK 800/DEF 800) to its controller’s opponent’s side of the field, in Attack Position. ② You can destroy this card and all face-up Plant-Type monsters on the field and Special Summon 1 monster with ATK equal to the total ATK of those monsters from your Graveyard.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① mandatory Trigger-like Effect CANNOT miss the timing.
*   Player A performs a Normal Summon, causing "Black Garden" to activate. Player A chooses which Zone the "Rose Token" is Summoned to, and is considered its _owner_ (for "Remove Brainwashing").
*   This effect activates in response to Normal and Special Summons (including when a monster is Special Summoned face-down), not Flip Summons.
*   This effect activates even if the Summmoned monster is unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards, its ATK will not be halved, but a "Rose Token" is still Special Summoned.
*   This effect activates even if a player cannot Special Summon a "Rose Token" (by "Vanity's Fiend" or while their opponent's Monster Card Zones are full), halving the ATK of the Summoned monster(s).
*   This effect activates once when multiple monsters are Special Summoned simultaneously. It will halve the ATK of each of those monsters and Summon a single "Rose Token".
*   "The Shallow Grave" causes both players to Special Summon a monster(s) simultaneously, and thus each player will also Special Summon 1 "Rose Token".
*   This effect activates multiple times if multiple monsters are Normal / Special Summoned sequentially in a chain (ex: "Ultimate Offering"). It will halve the ATK of each of those monsters and Summon 1 "Rose Token".
*   The ATK change applies while that monster is face-up, even if "Black Garden" leaves the field.
*   An affected monster equipped with "Megamorph": its ATK will be double its original ATK.
*   If a monster with "? ATK" (ex: "Tragoedia") is Normal / Special Summoned: first determine its original ATK, then halve it by "Black Garden"'s effect. That monster's ATK will not change.
*   If "Black Garden" and "The Wicked Dreadroot" are face-up on the field: when a monster is Normal or Special Summoned, its ATK is first halved by "The Wicked Dreadroot", and halved again afterwards when "Black Garden"'s effect resolves.
*   VS. "Torrential Tribute": If chained to the effect of "Black Garden", no "Rose Token" will be Summoned because the Normal / Special Summoned monster cannot have its ATK halved \[[REF1](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Forum:Black_Garden_vs._torrential/bottomless), [REF2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=659951)\].
*   VS. "Summon Limit": Player A Normal Summons a monster while Player B controls "Black Garden" and "Summon Limit". The "Rose Token" is considered Summoned by Player B's card effect, so Player A can Summon one more time that turn \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=635623)\].
*   VS. "Scapegoat": Player A controls "Black Garden" and activates "Scapegoat". The effect of "Black Garden" activates after the "Sheep Tokens" are Special Summoned, no "Rose Token" is Summoned since Player A cannot Special Summon. If Player A activates "Scapegoat" while Player B controls "Black Garden", "Black Garden" activates and Special Summons a "Rose Token" after "Scapegoat" resolves.
*   The ② Ignition-like Effect targets a monster in the Graveyard at activation.
*   You CANNOT activate this effect while there are no Plant-Type monsters on the field.
*   You CANNOT activate this effect while "Black Garden" cannot be destroyed (ex: "Field Barrier").
*   This effect can target a monster with 0 ATK so long as the total ATK of all Plant-Type monsters on the field (minimum 1) is also zero \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=709167)\].
*   "Black Garden" AND all face-up Plant-Type monsters are destroyed at resolution. This is not a cost.
*   This effect resolves sequentially. "Black Garden" AND 1(+) Plant-Type monster(s) must be destroyed by this effect to Summon the target.
*   If "Black Garden" is destroyed before resolving this effect, no Plant-Type monsters are destroyed and the target remains in the Graveyard.
*   If the total ATK of all Plant-Type monsters (+ ATK modifiers) is not the same as the ATK of the target, the target is not Summoned (you still destroy "Black Garden" and all Plant-Type monsters).
*   "Royal Oppression" CANNOT be activated when "Black Garden" is activated (played face-up).
*   "Royal Oppression" (and its effect) can chain to either of "Black Garden"'s effects.
