# Book Of Moon

> Flip 1 face-up monster on the field into face-down Defense Position.

*   This effect targets 1 face-up monster.
*   A monster flipped face-down remembers:
    *   if its Battle Position was changed this turn.
    *   that it declared an attack this turn.
    *   that it was Normal / Flip / Tribute / Ritual / Fusion / Synchro / Special Summoned.
    *   on what turn it was Summoned.
    *   which Synchro / Fusion / Ritual Material Monsters were used for its Summon.
*   A monster flipped face-down forgets:
    *   the properties of cards used for its Summon (name, Attribute, Type, etc.).
    *   what method / effect Summoned it (ex: "Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord").
    *   where it was Summoned from.
    *   lingering effects that previously applies to it (like "Limited Removal").
    *   if it used its "once per turn" effect(s) earlier this turn (read about exceptions [HERE](https://www.edisonformat.com/home/basic-strategy-flip-flop-fundamentals)).
    *   if it was Normal Summoned again (in the case of Gemini Monsters).
    *   if it had been Flip Summoned.
*   You cannot flip a Monster Token face-down because Monster Tokens are always face-up.
*   You cannot activate "Book of Moon" while "Light of Intervention" is active.
*   This card cannot be activated during the Damage Step.

### Card Rulings

Flipping a monster face-down will remove most "Lingering Effects" from it (except "change control" effects), EG:
● ATK changes from "Shrink", Gale, or "Card Trooper".
● The "Negate its effects" part of "Debris Dragon" or Vayu
● "But banish it if leaves the field" effects of "Plaguespreader Zombie" or "Battle Fader".

Flipping a monster face-down will sometimes cause a monster to "forget" things, EG:
● The fact that it was Summoned by a "Gladiator Beast"
● Whether or not it has used its "Once Per Turn" effect (except effects like "Des Lacooda"'s)
● Wheter or not it has been Gemini or Flip Summoned.
When a card specifies "that target", and "that target" is "1 face-up monster", Setting it can save it. EG:
● Karma Cut: "target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; banish that target".
Since "that target" is "1 face-up monster", if it's flipped face-down by this card, it is NOT banished.
● Caius the Shadow Monarch: "Target 1 card on the field; banish that target"
Since "that target" is "1 card on the field", if it's flipped face-down by this card, it IS banished.
● Paleozoic Dinomischus: Target 1 face-up card on the field; ...banish it."
Since this card banishes "it", it IS banished (this card is not legal in Edison, but is a good example).
