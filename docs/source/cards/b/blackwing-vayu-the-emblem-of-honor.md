# Blackwing - Vayu The Emblem Of Honor

> ① If this card is face-up on the field, you cannot use it for a Synchro Summon. ② If this card is in your Graveyard, you can remove from play this card plus 1 non-Tuner “Blackwing” monster in your Graveyard, and Special Summon 1 “Blackwing” Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck whose Level equals the total Levels of the removed monsters. The effect(s) of that Synchro Monster is negated.

*   The ① Continuous Effect CAN be negated (by "Skill Drain" or if Vayu is Special Summoned by Shura).
*   The ② Ignition Effect targets a "Blackwing" Monster in your Graveyard.
    *   Vayu + 1 non-Tuner "Blackwing" monster are removed from play when this effect resolves. This is not a cost.
    *   Both monsters must be removed from play by Vayu’s effect to perform the Special Summon.
        *   Example: Player A activates Vayu's effect targeting Sirocco in their Graveyard. Player B chains "D.D. Crow" and targets that same Sirocco. When the chain resolves, Vayu could not remove both itself and its target from play in the Graveyard. Thus, Player A's Vayu is not remove from play, and no "Blackwing" Synchro monster is Special Summoned.
    *   This effect does not perform a Synchro Summon. It can be activated while "Discord" is active.
    *   Since the monster was not properly Synchro Summoned, it cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard / removed from play (ex: "Call of the Haunted", "Return from the Different Dimension").

> ① can't be used as Synchro Material.
> ② If this card is in your GY:
> You can target 1 non-Tuner "Blackwing" monster in your GY; banish both this card and the target, and if you do, Special Summon 1 "Blackwing” Synchro from your Extra Deck, whose Level equals the total Levels of those monsters (negate its effects).

### Card Rulings

● This card’s ① effect is an effect, so it can be negated by effects (for example, by Shura).
● If “Royal Oppression” is chained to this card’s ② effect, this card is not banished, since the effect to banish both monsters is negated. This effect can then activate again that same turn.
● The monsters summoned this way are not Synchro Summoned monsters.
This means that they can't be summoned by card effects if later sent to the GY/Banished (Goyo Guardian can't Summon a monster summoned this way).
