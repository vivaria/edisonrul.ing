    *   Only monsters whose current ATK (including ATK changes) is 1500(+) are destroyed.
    *   If a monster(s) is flipped face-down, its ATK cannot be verified and so it is not destroyed.

    *   Monsters Summoned simultaneously (by "Return from the Different Dimension") with less than 1500 ATK (or that were Special Summoned face-down) are not destroyed / removed from play.
    *   If the opponent activates "Monster Reborn" and chains "Call of the Haunted", "Bottomless Trap Hole" can activate after that Chain resolves, destroying the monster Summoned in Chain Link 1.
*   You cannot activate this card during the Damage Step.
*   You cannot activate this card after "Jinzo" is Summoned.
*   You cannot activate this card if a monster(s) is Normal / Special Summoned as Chain Link 2+.

### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① When your opponent Summons a Monster(s) with 1500+ ATK:
> Destroy that monster(s) with 1500+ ATK, and if you do, banish it.

### Card Rulings

● If the monster doesn't have 1500 or more ATK when this effect resolves, it is not destroyed, and it is nor banished.
● Since this effect destroys, "Stardust Dragon"'s effect can be chained to it.
● Although the monster is destroyed, it is never actually sent to the GY. It is banished directly from the field.

● Like most Trap cards, this card can miss the timing.
For example, if "Jar of Greed" was activated,
and "Call of the Haunted" is chained to it,
this card can't be activated when that monster was Summoned,
as the Summon was not the last thing to happen
(Jar of Greed drawing a card was).
