### Card Text

> As long as this card remains face-up on the field, any effect of increasing your opponent's Life Points is changed to inflict the same amount of points in damage to your opponent's Life Points.

### Card Rulings

*   The Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field. It does not activate.
*   This effect is not cumulative. If you control 2 copies of "Bad Reaction to Simochi" and your opponent activates "Dian Keto the Cure Master", they only take 1000 points of damage \[[REF](http://web.archive.org/web/20080131140306/http:/entertainment.upperdeck.com/COMMUNITY/forums/thread/1005905.aspx)\].
*   VS. "Prime Material Dragon": if both "Bad Reaction to Simochi" and "Prime Material Dragon" are on the field when Player A's "Upstart Goblin" resolves, Player B will gain 1000 Life Points (gains / damage happen normally) \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=808154)\].
    *   These rules apply similarly to "Nurse Reficule the Fallen One" (erratum: Darklord Nurse Reficule).
*   If you control this card on the field and activate "Rain of Mercy" (which makes both players gain 1000 LP): you gain 1000 Life Points and your opponent takes 1000 points of damage.
