### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① Gains 300 ATK for each Plant you control.
> ② Control of this card can't Switch.

### Card Rulings

*   While this card's ② effect is applying, it can't be equipped to an opponent's "Relinquished", as that involves changing control of it.

### Card Text

> ① This card gains 300 ATK for each face-up Plant-Type monster you control. ② Control of this face-up card cannot switch.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Continuous Effect constantly re-calculates the ATK gain. This effect does not activate.
*   This effect stops re-calculating if a non-continuous effect (ex: "Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind") changes the ATK value of "Botanical Lion".
*   The ② Continuous Effect prevents any attempt to change control of this face-up card.
*   This effect prevents "Botanical Lion" from becoming an Equip Spell by the effect of "Relinquished".
*   A face-down "Botanical Lion" can still change control (by "Mind Control" / "Creature Swap").
*   A face-down "Botanical Lion" stolen by "Mind Control" and flipped face-up DOES NOT return to its owner's side of the field during the End Phase.
*   This effect DOES NOT prevent "Goyo Guardian" from Special Summoning a "Botanical Lion".
