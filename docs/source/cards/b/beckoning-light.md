*   You CANNOT activate "Beckoning Light" if you have no cards in your hand.
*   You CANNOT activate "Beckoning Light" if there are fewer LIGHT monsters in your Graveyard than there are cards in your hand, even if 1 or more of the cards in your hand are LIGHT monsters.
*   You can activate "Beckoning Light" while "Macro Cosmos" is active, but since no cards will be discarded to the Graveyard, you CANNOT add any LIGHT monsters from your Graveyard to your hand \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=982726)\].
