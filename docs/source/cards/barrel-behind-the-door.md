# Barrel Behind The Door

> Activate only when a card's effect that would inflict damage to you is activated. Your opponent takes the damage instead.

*   This card can only be Chained to an activated effect that inflicts damage to YOUR Life Points.
    *   You can activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Jigen Bakudan". You donâ€™t activate "Barrel Behind the Door" when the Flip Effect activates, you activate "Barrel Behind the Door" when "Jigen Bakudan" activates its effect during the next Standby Phase to inflict damage.
    *   You can activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Ring of Destruction", and then your opponent will take all of the damage (the damage inflicted to him and the damage that would have been inflicted to you). The same is true for "Tremendous Fire".
    *   You can activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Magic Cylinder". The attack will be negated and the damage transferred to the opponent.
*   VS. "Ceasefire": You can't activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Ceasefire" if all monsters on the field are face-down, or if all monsters on the field are face-up Normal Monsters, but you can activate it against "Ceasefire" if there is at least 1 face-up Effect Monster on the field.
*   VS: "Bad Reaction to Simochi": If "Bad Reaction to Simochi" is active, you can activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against effects that would normally cause a Life Point increase, because they inflict damage instead.
*   This card can't be Chained to Life Point costs (ex: "Wall of Revealing Light"), to effects that make you lose Life Points (ex: "The Immortal of Thunder"), to effects that switch damage (like another "Barrel Behind the Door") because they do not inflict damage, they simply transfer it, to cards that do not inflict damage when the card resolves (ex: "Graverobber"), nor to effects that aren't guaranteed to inflict Effect Damage (ex: "Time Wizard", "Ante").
*   This card can't be Chained to a Continuous Spell / Trap Card, an Equip Spell Card, or a Field Spell Card.
    *   Example: "Magical Thorn", "Dark Snake Syndrome", "Wave-Motion Cannon", or "Black Pendant".
*   This card can't be Chained to Continuous Effects (ex: "Fire Princess") since they don't activate.
