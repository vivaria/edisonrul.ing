# LIGHT OF JUDGMENT

*   "Light of Judgment" does NOT target. You select the card when "Light of Judgment"'s effect resolves.
*   You can look at your opponent's hand when you resolve "Light of Judgment"'s effect.
*   If your opponent chains "Mystical Space Typhoon" to "Light of Judgment" and destroys "The Sanctuary in the Sky", the effect of "Light of Judgment" is still applied.
