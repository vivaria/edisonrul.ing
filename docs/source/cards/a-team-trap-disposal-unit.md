# A-TEAM: TRAP DISPOSAL UNIT  
> ① This effect can be used during either player's turn. When your opponent activates a Trap Card, Tribute this face-up card to negate the activation of the Trap Card and destroy it.

*   The ① Quick Effect is optional, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Tributing this card is a cost.
    *   This effect only negates the activation of a Trap Card (when it is flipped face-up).
    *   This effect can't negate the activation of an effect from a Trap Card that was already face-up on the field (like "Royal Oppression"), or that activates in the Graveyard (like "Skill Successor").
    *   You can activate the effect of "A-Team: Trap Disposal Unit" during the Damage Step.
