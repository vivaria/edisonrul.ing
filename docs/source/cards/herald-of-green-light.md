# HERALD OF GREEN LIGHT

> ① You can send this card and 1 other Fairy-Type monster from your hand to the Graveyard to negate the activation of an opponent's Spell Card and destroy it. This effect can be activated during either player's turn.

*   The ① Quick Effect can activate in the Damage Step, as it negates the activation of cards/effects.
    *   Sending this card and 1 Fairy-Type monster from hand to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   This effect activates & resolves in the hand.
    *   By negating the activation of the previous card in the Chain, that Link is removed when the Chain resolves. The last thing to happen is this effect resolving, negating and destroying the other card.
    *   This effect cannot activate while "Macro Cosmos" is active.
