# INFORMER SPIDER

*   This effect targets 1 Defense Position monster. This effect activates even if “Informer Spider” is destroyed during the Damage Step.
*   The effect of “Informer Spider” does not activate if it is sent to the Graveyard as a cost to activate a card or effect.
*   If “Informer Spider” is sent to the Graveyard when all your Monster Card Zones are full, the effect will activate and you will target a monster. The targeted monster will be destroyed when the effect resolves because you cannot take control of it.
*   You gain control of the targeted monster for as long as it is on the field.
