# Montage Dragon

*   You cannot Special Summon "Montage Dragon" while "Macro Cosmos" or "Dimensional Fissure", etc. is face-up on the field because you cannot send Monster Cards from your hand to the Graveyard.
*   If you send a WATER monster from your hand to the Graveyard while "A Legendary Ocean" is active, the original Level of the monster is used and not the reduced Level.
*   If "Montage Dragon" is flipped face-down by "Book of Moon", etc., when it is flipped face-up its ATK is 0.
*   If "Skill Drain" is active while "Montage Dragon" is face-up on the field, its ATK becomes 0. If "Skill Drain" is later negated or removed from the field, its ATK remains 0.
