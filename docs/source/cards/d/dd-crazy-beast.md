# D.D. Crazy Beast

*   "D.D. Crazy Beast"'s effect is applied at the end of the Damage Step, removing the destroyed monster from play instead of sending it to the Graveyard.
*   If "D.D. Crazy Beast" attacks an Attack Position monster with the same ATK and both monsters are destroyed, "D.D. Crazy Beast"'s effect is not applied.
