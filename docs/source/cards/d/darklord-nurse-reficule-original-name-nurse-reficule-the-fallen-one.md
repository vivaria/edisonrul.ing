# Darklord Nurse Reficule (Original Name: Nurse Reficule The Fallen One)

> ① Any effect that would cause your opponent to gain Life Points instead inflicts the same amount of damage to your opponent.

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate, it applies when the effect resolves.
    *   This deals Effect Damage, and is not the same as losing Life Points (ex: "Immortal of Thunder").
    *   This effect will not apply while "Skill Drain" negates this card's effect.
    *   "Nurse Reficule" must be face-up on the field to apply this effect.
    *   This effect does not stack. Two copies of "Nurse Reficule" will NOT cause "Upstart Goblin" to inflict 2000 points of Damage, it only converts the 1000 Life Point gain into 1000 points of damage \[[REF](http://web.archive.org/web/20080131140306/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/COMMUNITY/forums/thread/1005905.aspx)\].
*   VS. "Prime Material Dragon": if both "Nurse Reficule" and "Prime Material Dragon" are on the field when Player A's "Upstart Goblin" resolves, Player B will gain 1000 Life Points (gains / damage happen normally) \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=808154)\].
    *   These rules apply similarly to "Bad Reaction to Simochi".
