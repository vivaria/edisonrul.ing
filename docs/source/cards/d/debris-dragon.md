### Card Text

> ① When this card is Normal Summoned, you can Special Summon 1 monster with 500 or less ATK from your Graveyard in Attack Position. That monster’s effect(s) is negated. Ⓒ This card cannot be used as a Synchro Material Monster, except for the Synchro Summon of a Dragon-Type Synchro Monster. Ⓒ The other Synchro Material Monster(s) cannot be Level 4.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect follows a "When... you can" structure and can miss the timing.
    *   This effect targets the monster in the Graveyard, and will be negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   The Summoned monster can still activate its effect(s) to pay costs (ex: "Lonefire Blossom"), but it will resolve without effect.
*   This card has two Ⓒ Conditions ([Rule Effects](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Condition)) which CANNOT be negated.
