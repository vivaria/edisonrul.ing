### Card Rulings

*   Sending 3 cards from the top of your Deck to the GY is part of the effect of “Destruction of Destiny”. It is not a cost.
*   If “Macro Cosmos” is on the field the 3 cards will be removed from play, but you will still take damage for any Spell or Trap Cards.
*   You can't activate “Destruction of Destiny” if you have less than 3 cards in your Deck.
*   All the damage is dealt in a single sum. So if you send 3 Spell or Trap Cards you take 3000 damage, not 1000 damage three times.
