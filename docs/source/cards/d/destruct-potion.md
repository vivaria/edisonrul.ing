*   This targets 1 monster you control. If your opponent takes control of the targeted monster, it is still destroyed and you gain Life Points. Destroying the monster and gaining Life Points happen at the same time. You gain Life Points equal to the monsterâ€™s ATK on the field. If you target a face-down monster you gain no Life Points.
