### Card Rulings

*   The card targeted by “Dark World Lightning” must be face-down when “Dark World Lightning” resolves in order to be destroyed. If you target a face-down Spell or Trap Card, and the opponent activates it in a chain, then it will not be destroyed by “Dark World Lightning”. If you target a face-down monster, and it is flipped up in a chain by a card effect before “Dark World Lighting” resolves, the monster is not destroyed.
*   If you do not destroy the targeted face-down card with the effect of “Dark World Lightning” (such as if it is face-up as resolution, or if it is destroyed by another effect first), you do NOT discard 1 card from your hand.
*   You cannot activate this card if you have no other cards in your hand. If an effect is chained to “Dark World Lightning” that makes you discard all the cards in your hand, then the face-down target of “Dark World Lightning” will still be destroyed, even though you cannot discard 1 card.
*   Discarding 1 card is part of the effect of “Dark World Lightning”, it is not a cost. (So you can use it to activate the effects of “Dark World” monsters, for example.)
