### Card Rulings

*   You can, for example, Summon 1 Zombie from your opponent’s Graveyard, and 2 from yours, etc.
*   This effect targets 1 or more monsters in the Graveyard(s).
*   After the Zombie(s) are Summoned, they are no longer targeted by “Doomkaiser Dragon/Assault Mode”.
*   Even if “Doomkaiser Dragon/Assault Mode” is removed from the field, those Zombies’ effects are still negated, and they are still destroyed during the End Phase.
*   Destroying the Special Summoned monsters in the End Phase does not start a chain.
