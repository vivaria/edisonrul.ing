# D - Formation

*   Placing 1 D Counter onto "D - Formation" does not start a Chain.
*   The second effect of "D - Formation" starts a Chain. It does not target.
*   You cannot activate "D-Formation"'s second effect when you Special Summon a monster face-down.
*   If an effect is chained that flips the Normal or Special Summoned monster face-down, "D-Formation"'s effect disappears.
*   If you have 2 or more "D-Formations" with 2 D Counters when you Normal or Special Summon a monster, you can activate the second effect of each "D-Formation".
*   If a cardâ€™s effect Special Summons multiple monsters during your Main Phase, you can activate the second effect of "D-Formation". In this case you will select which monster you will apply towards the effect when "D-Formation"'s effect resolves.
