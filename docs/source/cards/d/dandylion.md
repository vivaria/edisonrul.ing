### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① If this card is sent to the GY: Special Summon 2 "Fluff Tokens" in Defense Position.
> (Plant/ WIND/ LV1/ ATK 0/ DEF 0) (They can’t be Tributed for a Tribute Summon during the turn they are Summoned).

### Card Rulings

● You cannot use Fluff Tokens for a Tribute Set.
● You can't declare the name of a token with “Prohibition”.
● Summoning 2 Tokens means that you must Summon 2 Tokens. You cannot choose to Summon 1 nor 3. Summoning 4 would be right out.
●In this format, If this card is discarded for “Monster Reincarnation”, and then added back to the hand by the same “Monster Reincarnation”, its effect activates in the hand.
