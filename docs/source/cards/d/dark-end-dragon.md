# Dark End Dragon

> ① One per turn, you can have this card lose 500 ATK and DEF, and sent 1 monster your opponent controls to the Graveyard.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect targets an opponent’s (face-up / face-down) monster.
    *   If the target leaves the field before this effect resolves, this card still loses 500 ATK and DEF \[[REF](https://ms.yugipedia.com//a/af/Card_Rulings_-_Raging_Battle_v1.2.pdf)\].
    *   If "Dark End Dragon" cannot lose 500 ATK and DEF (it was flipped face-down / it left the field, or its ATK/DEF have been reduced): the targeted monster is not sent to the graveyard.
    *   This effect cannot be activated if "Dark End Dragon" has less than 500 ATK and DEF.
