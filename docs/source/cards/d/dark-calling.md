### Card Rulings

Remove from play, from your hand or your GY, the Fusion Material Monsters listed on a Fusion Monster Card that can only be Special Summoned with Dark Fusion, and Special Summon that monster from your Fusion Deck. (This Special Summon is treated as a Fusion Summon with Dark Fusion.)
*   You can remove from play monsters both in your hand or GY, so you can remove from play only monsters in your GY, only monsters in your hand, or monsters in your hand and GY.
*   This card does not target. Fusion Materials are removed from play when this effect resolves.
*   This card/effect can't be activated while Imperial Iron Wall prevents removing cards from play.
*   If Imperial Iron Wall is chained to Dark Calling, Dark Calling resolves without effect.
*   Banish, from your hand or your GY, the Fusion Material Monsters listed on a Fusion Monster Card that can only be Special Summoned with Dark Fusion and Special Summon that monster from your Extra Deck. are not considered to happen simultaneously.
*   The Fusion Monster is treated as if it was Fusion Summoned by Dark Fusion. The effect of Dark Fusion that prevents the monster from being targeted by the opponent's card effects is not applied.
*   Fusion Material substitutes (like King of the Swamp) can be used if Dark Calling would Summon a monster that specifically names at least one of its Fusion Material Monsters. Fusion Material substitutes can't be used to Fusion Monster Evil Hero Dark Gaia which does not specifically name any Fusion Material Monsters (1 Fiend-Type monster + 1 Rock-Type monster), nor can they be used to Summon a monster whose condition reads: A Fusion Summon of this monster can only be conducted with the above Fusion Material Monsters.
