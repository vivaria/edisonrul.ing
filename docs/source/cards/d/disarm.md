# Disarm

*   The “Gladiator Beast” monster returned to the Deck is returned to the Deck when “Disarm” is resolved. It is not a cost. You must show the “Gladiator Beast” to your opponent when resolving “Disarm’s” effect.
*   You cannot activate “Disarm” if you do not have a “Gladiator Beast” monster in your hand.
