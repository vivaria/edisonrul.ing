### Card Text

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect only affects Monster Cards that would be sent to the Graveyard.
    *   Face-down monsters that would be sent to the Graveyard are also removed from play.
    *   Cards/effects whose cost send/discard a monster(s) '_to the Graveyard_' CANNOT activate.
        *   Examples: "Herald of Orange Light", "Card Trooper", and "Jowgen the Spiritualist".
    *   Cards/effects whose cost send/discard a monster(s) CAN activate.
        *   Example: "Magic Jammer", "Dark Grepher".
    *   Cards/effects that send/discard a monster(s) '_to the Graveyard_' at resolution CAN activate.
        *   Examples: "Foolish Burial", "Blaze Accelerator", and "Needlebug Nest".
*   VS. "Archlord Kristya": If a face-up Kristya would be sent from the field to the Graveyard (and removed from play), its effect will still trigger and places it back on top of the Deck.

### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① Any monster sent to the GY is banished instead.

### Card Rulings

While the ① is applying, players cannot:
● Pay costs by sending a monster(s) to the GY
(Brionac's effect cannot be activated by discarding a monster).
● Pay costs by sending an unknown card(s) to the GY
(Jowgen, Card Trooper, Celestia, Hidden Armory cannot be activated, as they send to the GY to pay a cost).

While the ① is applying, players can:
● Discard monster cards.
(Swap Frog can discard a monster to summon itself, as it does not specify "to the GY").
● Send cards to the GY by card effect
(Foolish burial can be activated. The sent monster is banished)
(Ryko's effect can be activated, as it sends to the GY as an effect. Any monsters sent this way are banished).
● Tribute, Fusion, Ritual, Synchro Summon
(Materials/Tributes are banished instead).
