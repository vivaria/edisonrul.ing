### Card Rulings

*   “Destiny Hero – Dreadmaster’s” second sentence is applied if he is Special Summoned by any method, not just by the effect of “Clock Tower Prison”.
*   “Destiny Hero – Dreadmaster’s” first effect (to destroy your non-“Destiny Hero” monsters and Special Summon 2 “Destiny Hero” monsters) is a Trigger Effect and his other effects are Continuous Effects.
*   Destroying all your non-“Destiny Hero” monsters and Special Summoning 2 “Destiny Hero” monsters is resolved in the same chain link. Even if you have no monsters that will be destroyed you still get to Special Summon 2 “Destiny Hero” monsters.
*   If you have any face-down “Destiny Hero” monsters, they will be destroyed, because their names cannot be confirmed.
