### Card Rulings

*   If you have “A Legendary Ocean” on the field and “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” is destroyed, you can activate “D – Time” and add a Level 4 or lower monster to your hand. If “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” is returned to the hand, then you can only add a Level 3 or lower monster to your hand because the effect of “A Legendary Ocean” still applies to “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” while he’s in your hand.
