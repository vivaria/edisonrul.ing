# Destiny Hero - Doom Lord

> ① Once per turn, if this card is in face-up Attack Position, you can remove from play 1 monster your opponent controls. Ⓒ If you use this effect, you cannot declare an attack this turn, and the removed monster will be returned to the opponent's side of the field in the same battle position during your second Standby Phase after activation.

*   The ① Ignition Effect targets a monster.
    *   Doom Lord must remain in face-up Attack Position for this effect to resolve.
    *   The target can be face-up or face-down. A face-down monster removed by this effect will remain face-down while removed from play and none of its effects will activate.
    *   This effect cannot be activated the turn you declared an attack, even if the attack was negated.
    *   If you have both “Destiny Hero – Doom Lord” and “Berserk Gorilla” face-up on the field you can still activate “Doom Lord’s” effect. “Berserk Gorilla” will not be able to attack that turn.
*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated.
    *   If all 5 of your opponent’s Monster Card Zones are full when the removed monster would return to play, it is destroyed (by game mechanic) and sent to the Graveyard.
    *   Returning the monster to play does not start a chain. The effect will resolve and the monster will return to play during your 2nd Standby Phase even if “Destiny Hero – Doom Lord” is not on the field.
    *   If your 2nd Standby Phase is skipped (by “Solomon’s Lawbook”), the monster will never return.
    *   You can activate this effect even if your Battle Phase skipped by a card effect like “Soul Exchange”.
