### Card Rulings

*   The Ignition Effect targets a monster.
*   Doom Lord must remain in Attack Position for this effect to resolve.
*   The target can be face-up or face-down. A face-down monster removed by this effect will remain face-down while removed from play and none of its effects will activate.
*   This effect can't be activated the turn you declared an attack, even if the attack was negated.
*   If you have both “Destiny Hero – Doom Lord” and “Berserk Gorilla” face-up on the field you can still activate “Doom Lord’s” effect. “Berserk Gorilla” won't be able to attack that turn.
*   The Condition can't be negated.
*   If all 5 of your opponent’s Monster Card Zones are full when the removed monster would return to play, it is destroyed (by game mechanic) and sent to the GY.
*   Returning the monster to play does not start a chain. The effect will resolve and the monster will return to play during your 2nd Standby Phase even if “Destiny Hero – Doom Lord” is not on the field.
*   If your 2nd Standby Phase is skipped (by “Solomon’s Lawbook”), the monster will never return.
*   You can activate this effect even if your Battle Phase skipped by a card effect like “Soul Exchange”.
