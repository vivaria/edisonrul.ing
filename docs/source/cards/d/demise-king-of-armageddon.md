### Card Rulings

*   The Ⓒ Summoning Condition common to Ritual Monsters at the time is poorly worded.
*   This card CAN be Ritual Summoned by "Advanced Ritual Art" or "Contract with the Abyss".
*   The ① Ignition Effect can be used many times in the same turn.
*   This effect does not target.
*   Paying 2000 Life Points is a cost.
*   If "Book of Moon" is chained to flip Demise face-down, he is still not destroyed by his effect.
