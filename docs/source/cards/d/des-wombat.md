*   “Des Wombat” even protects you against card effects where the damage is undecided at activation, like “Dice Jar”.
*   “Des Wombat” will protect you against the effect damage of “Graverobber”.
*   If your only “Des Wombat” is destroyed by “Judgment of Anubis” or “Ring of Destruction”, it is no longer on the field so it won't protect you against the damage from these card effects.
