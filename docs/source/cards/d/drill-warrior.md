> You can halve this card’s ATK, and if you do, this turn, it can attack directly.
> ② Once per turn: You can discard 1 card,
> and if you do, banish this card.
> ③ If you do, during your next Standby Phase:
> Special Summon this banished card, then add 1 monster from your GY to your hand.

### Card Rulings

The ①:
*   ATK remains halved until Drill leaves the field or is flipped face-down.

*   The ②:
*   Discarding is part of the effect, not a cost.
*   If "Book of Moon" is chained, you still discard 1 card, and this card is still banished.
*   If "Raigeki Break" is chained, you still discard 1 card, but this card is not banished.
*   A discarded "Peten the Dark Clown" will not miss its timing. You can read more about that here: https://edisonformat.net/rules/compendium/conjunctions

The ③:
*   This card is always Summoned to its owner's field (even if it was banished from the other player's field).
*   If you control 5 monsters, Drill is sent to GY instead of being Summoned (no card is added to the hand).
*   If you add a monster to your hand, “add 1 monster” happens after “Special Summon this card”, so cards like Torrential Tribute will have incorrect activation timing.
