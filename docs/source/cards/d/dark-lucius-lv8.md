### Card Rulings

*   “Dark Lucius LV8” must be on the field in order to negate a monster’s effect and remove it from play. If “Dark Lucius LV8” is returned to the hand because of “Begone, Knave!”, it does not negate effects or remove monsters from play.
*   If “Dark Lucius LV8” destroys “D.D. Scout Plane”, it will still be Special Summoned because you can't negate the effect of a monster that is activated while removed from play.
