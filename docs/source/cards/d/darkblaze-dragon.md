# Darkblaze Dragon

*   "Darkblaze Dragon"'s effect doubles its original ATK and DEF to create a new current ATK and DEF.
*   "Darkblaze Dragon"'s effect that doubles it original ATK and DEF to create a new current ATK and DEF disappears when "Darkblaze Dragon" is removed from the field or flipped face-down.
*   If "Skill Drain" is face-up on the field when "Darkblaze Dragon" is Special Summoned from the Graveyard, or if "Skill Drain" is activated after "Darkblaze Dragon" is Special Summoned from the Graveyard, "Skill Drain" will negate "Darkblaze Dragon"'s effect that doubles its original ATK and DEF to create a new current ATK and DEF. If "Skill Drain" is later negated or removed from the field, the original ATK and DEF are not doubled again.
*   If "Darkblaze Dragon" has its original ATK and DEF doubled to create a new current ATK and DEF and "Shrink" is used on the “Darkblaze Dragon”, the current ATK of "Darkblaze Dragon" becomes half of its original ATK. (its ATK would be 600 and its DEF would be 2000)
