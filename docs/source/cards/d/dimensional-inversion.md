### Card Rulings

*   If multiple monsters you control are being removed from play simultaneously, you can still activate “Dimensional Inversion”. Select 1 of those monsters to be Special Summoned.
*   If your opponent controls “Macro Cosmos”, “Banisher of the Light”, etc., and an effect is activated by either player that sends a monster to the Graveyard, you can activate “Dimensional Inversion”. This is because your monster is being removed from play (instead of being sent to the Graveyard) by the effect of your opponent’s card.
*   If both players control “Macro Cosmos”, etc., and a monster is sent to the Graveyard, assume that the turn player’s effect is the one that removes it from play. So in this case, the opponent can activate “Dimensional Inversion” but the turn player cannot.
*   You cannot activate “Dimensional Inversion” when a Trap Monster like “Embodiment of Apophis” is removed from play.
*   You can activate “Dimensional Inversion” even when a monster is removed from play temporarily. For example, if your monster is controlled by your opponent, and your opponent uses “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” on it, you can activate “Dimensional Inversion”.
*   If a card is removed from play with “Lightforce Sword” or “Different Dimension Capsule”, you cannot activate “Dimensional Inversion” because you cannot verify the card is a monster.
*   You cannot activate "Dimensional Inversion" during the Damage Step.
