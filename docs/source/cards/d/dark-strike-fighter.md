*   Compute damage based on the monster’s Level while it was on the field, not its level in the Graveyard or removed zone.
    *   This means you can Tribute “Embodiment of Apophis” or “Zoma the Spirit” to do 800 damage.
*   If you Tribute a face-down monster, compute damage based on the monster’s original Level printed on the card. Tributing a monster is a cost.
