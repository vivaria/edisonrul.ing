### Card Rulings

*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated.
    *   "Dark Ruler Ha Des" cannot be Special Summoned face-down by "The Shallow Grave".
    *   "Dark Ruler Ha Des" can be Special Summoned by "Return from the Different Dimension".
*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate. It also applies to Ha Des.
    *   This effect CANNOT be negated by "Divine Wrath", but CAN be negated by "Skill Drain".
    *   This effect does not apply if "Zombie World" changes to your Fiend-Types into Zombie-Types.
*   Monster destroyed by battle are marked for destruction at the end of Damage Calculation.
    *   Effects that activate in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation are negated.
    *   Effects that activate in Substep 6 - Resolve Effects are negated (ex: "Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter" and "D.D. Warrior Lady").
    *   Effects that activate in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step are negated (ex: "Mystic Tomato").
    *   Effects that activate in the Graveyard are negated; such as "Treeborn Frog", "Plaguespreader Zombie", "Sinister Serpent". The negation is reset if these cards are removed from the Graveyard.
    *   This effect does not affect monsters destroyed as substitutes such as "Six Samurai" monsters, or if "Relinquished" would be destroyed by battle while equipped with "Sangan".
*   If your "Dark Ruler Ha Des" or other Fiend-Type monster destroys "Tyrant Dragon" as a result of battle, a Dragon-Type monster must still be Tributed when "Tyrant Dragon" is Special Summoned from the Graveyard. This is because Tributing a Dragon-Type monster is a condition on the Summoning of the card; it is not part of the effect. For the same reason, if a Spirit Monster is destroyed by a Fiend-Type monster when "Dark Ruler Ha Des" is on the field, it still cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard. Also if two "Dark Ruler Ha Des" destroy each other in battle, neither can be Special Summoned from the Graveyard.
