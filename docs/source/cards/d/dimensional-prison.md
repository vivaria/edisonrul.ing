# Dimensional Prison

> Activate only when your opponent declares an attack. Remove from play the attacking monster.

*   This card targets the attacking monster.
*   You cannot choose to activate cards/effects like "Dimensional Prison" while "Imperial Iron Wall" is active.
*   If "Imperial Iron Wall" is chained to such a card/effect, then no card is removed from play.
*   If "Book of Moon" is used on an attacking monster, then that monster is no longer considered to be an attacking monster. Thus, if "Book of Moon" is Chained to an effect like "Dimensional Prison" or "Sakuretsu Armor" and changes the monster to face-down Defense Position, then the effect of "Sakuretsu Armor" does not resolves, so the attacking monster is not destroyed (or removed from play, and so on).
*   If something like "Enemy Controller" is Chained to something like "Sakuretsu Armor" or "Dimensional Prison" so that control of the attacking monster changes, then the effect of "Sakuretsu Armor" does not destroy the attacking monster.
*   If the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" is activated when a monster declares an attack, then the Battle Phase ends, so the attacking monster can no longer be treated as an "attacking monster".
    *   If the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" is activated in Chain to an effect like "Sakuretsu Armor" or "Dimensional Prison", then the effect of "Sakuretsu Armor" is not applied, and the attacking monster remains on the field.
    *   If the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" is activated in Chain to "Magic Cylinder", then the Battle Phase ends, so "Magic Cylinder" cannot negate the attack so the effect of inflicting damage equal to the monster's ATK is not applied.
    *   The effect of "Mirror Force" only destroys all monsters in Attack Position, so all Attack Position monsters will still be destroyed even if the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" ends the Battle Phase.
