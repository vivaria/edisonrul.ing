### Card Rulings

*   The "proper order" in the text of "Destiny Board" means the order the Spirit Messages are placed on the field, not the order that they occupy your Spell and Trap Card Zones. So if you read your Zones from left to right as N-F-A-I-L, it is okay as long as they came on the field in the order of F-I-N-A-L.
*   If you have two copies of "Destiny Board" on the field you may place two Spirit Messages from your hand or Deck onto the field but you cannot place the fifth one until one of your two "Destiny Boards" is removed from the field.
*   If all of your Spell and Trap Card Zones are occupied during your opponent’s End Phase, you cannot use the effect of "Destiny Board" that turn.
*   If your "Destiny Board" or any of your Spirit Messages is destroyed or removed from the field, all your remaining Spirit Messages and "Destiny Boards" on the field are destroyed. If your opponent has any, they are not destroyed.
*   If "Imperial Order" is active on the field it will not stop the effect of "Destiny Board" to place Spirit Messages on the field, nor will it stop a player who completes the message from declaring victory.
*   If "Jinzo" or "Royal Decree" is on the field, "Destiny Board’s effect will be negated and you cannot place a Spirit Message on the field. Also if one of the Spirit Messages or "Destiny Board" is destroyed while "Jinzo" or "Royal Decree" is on the field, the others will NOT be destroyed. If "Jinzo" is destroyed in the End Phase you may activate "Destiny Board"’s effect afterwards.
*   "Cold Wave" will prevent the effect of "Destiny Board" to bring a Spirit Message to the field for the turn "Cold Wave" is activated.
*   The placing of a Spirit Message on the field by the effect of "Destiny Board" cannot be negated with "Magic Jammer", "Magic Drain", "Solemn Judgment", etc.
*   If you have a Spirit Message in your hand you cannot activate it, they can only be placed on the field by the effect of "Destiny Board" during your opponent’s End Phase.
