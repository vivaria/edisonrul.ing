### Card Rulings

*   The ① Ignition Effect resolves even if "Dimensional Alchemist" is flipped face-down / leaves the field.
*   Remove from play the top card of your Deck when the effect resolves, NOT as a cost \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=841434), [REF2](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/118829-dimensional-alchemist-vs-skill-drain/)\].
*   The card is removed from play face-up, and "Dimensional Alchemist" simultaneously gains 500 ATK.
*   The ② Optional "_When \[...\] you can_" Trigger Effect can miss the timing.
*   This effect can activate in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step when it is sent to the Graveyard.
*   This effect can activate when the last thing to happen in Chain Link 1 was this card's destruction.
*   This effect cannot activate if this card was destroyed as Chain Link 2+.
*   This effect cannot activate if this card was removed from play, it must be sent to the Graveyard.
