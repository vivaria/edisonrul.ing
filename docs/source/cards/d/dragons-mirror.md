# Dragon'S Mirror

> Remove from play, from your side of the field or your Graveyard, Fusion Material Monsters that are listed on a Dragon-Type Fusion Monster Card, and Special Summon that Fusion Monster from your Fusion Deck. (This Special Summon is treated as a Fusion Summon.)

*   “Dragon’s Mirror” does not target. You select and remove the monsters during resolution.
*   You can use fusion substitute monsters like “King of the Swamp” for “Dragon’s Mirror”.
*   If “Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer” is on your opponent’s side of the field, you can activate “Dragon’s Mirror” if all the Fusion Material Monsters are on the field; but not if any of them are in the Graveyard.
