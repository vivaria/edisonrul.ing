### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① This card's name becomes "Des Frog" while face-up on the field.
> ② Your opponent's Monsters can't target any monsters for attacks, except this one.
> ③ When sent from the field to the GY: You can add 1 "Frog" monster from your Deck/GY to your hand, except "Dupe Frog".

### Card Rulings

*   If you control 2 or more "Dupe Frog", your opponent can't attack any monsters (however, this doesn't prevent them from attacking directly with cards like "Drill Warrior").
*   If this card is tributed for the effect of "Substitoad", it will miss its timing.
