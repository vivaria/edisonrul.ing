### Card Text

> ① Once per turn, you can equip this card to a "Soitsu" you control, OR unequip it to Special Summon this card in face-up Attack Position. ② When equipped to a monster by this card's effect, that monster gains 2500 ATK. Ⓒ (A monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the equipped monster would be destroyed by battle, destroy this card instead.)

### Card Rulings

*   While “Non-Spellcasting Area” is active and “Doitsu” is equipped to “Soitsu”, the increase to ATK is not applied. However, the effect that destroys “Doitsu” instead of “Soitsu” is not an effect that “Soitsu” gets, so that effect is applied normally. Also, the effect of “Doitsu” that allows it to unequip and be Special Summoned is applied normally.
