# ZOMBYRA THE DARK

*   If this monster is flipped face-down its effect is reset (its ATK will again be 2100).
*   You can damage your opponent’s Life Points by attacking an opponent’s monster with a lower ATK than "Zombyra the Dark", but you cannot attack directly with him.
*   If "Zombyra the Dark" is the target of "Dark Spirit of the Silent" and your opponent controls no monsters, it may attack directly.
*   The reduction in ATK occurs immediately after the opposing monster is destroyed.
