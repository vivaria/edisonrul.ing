# Taunt

*   If a monster selected by "Taunt" is moved to the turn playerâ€™s side of the field, the turn player can conduct attacks normally without worrying about the effect of "Taunt", because without a card effect that allows it, a player cannot attack monsters on his own side of the field.
*   If multiple monsters are selected by multiple "Taunts", the turn player selects 1 of the monsters selected by "Taunt" and can attack it.
*   If 1 monster is selected by "Taunt" and another is equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", the turn player must attack the monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" if he attacks.
