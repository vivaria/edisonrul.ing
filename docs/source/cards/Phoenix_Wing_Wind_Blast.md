# PHOENIX WING WIND BLAST  
> Discard 1 card. Return 1 card your opponent controls to the top of the Deck.

*   Discarding 1 card is a cost. This can be activated while "Macro Cosmos" is active.
*   This effect targets 1 (face-up / face-down) card your opponent controls.
*   You can activate “Phoenix Wing Wind Blast” and target a face-up “Swords of Revealing Light” because it destroys itself by its own effect, instead of being destroyed when activated, like most Normal Spell Cards.
*   You cannot target a face-up non-Continuous, non-Equip Spell or Trap Card (ex: "Upstart Goblin"). This is because they are already “considered to be destroyed” once they are activated (even though they are not sent to the Graveyard until the chain resolves). If you target a face-down Spell or Trap Card, the opponent can activate it as a chain. If it is not Continuous, it will not be returned to the top of the Deck.
