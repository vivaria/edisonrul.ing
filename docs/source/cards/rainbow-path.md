# RAINBOW PATH

*   "Rainbow Path" targets the attacking monster. Sending a "Crystal Beast" card from your Spell and Trap Card Zone to your Graveyard is a cost.
*   Any "Crystal Beast" card in your Spell and Trap Card Zone can be used to pay the cost. If the "Crystal Beast" card is being treated as an Equip Card, it can be used to pay the cost.
*   You do not have to add a "Rainbow Dragon" or "Dark Rainbow Dragon" to your hand.
*   If "Rainbow Path" fails to negate the monster's attack, you cannot add "Rainbow Dragon" or "Dark Rainbow Dragon" to your hand.
