### Card Text

> ① You can send 1 monster from your hand to the Graveyard and Special Summon this card from your hand. Ⓒ You can substitute this card for any 1 “Synchron” Tuner monster for a Synchro Summon. Ⓒ This card cannot be used as a Synchro Material Monster, except for the Synchro Summon of a monster that lists a “Synchron” monster as a Tuner monster.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Special Summon starts a chain (treat it as an Ignition Effect) \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/119293-hardened-armed-dragon/)\].
    *   Sending (not discarding) 1 monster from your hand to the Graveyard is not a cost.
    *   Sending 1 monster from your hand to the Graveyard and the Special Summon occur simultaneously.
    *   This effect can activate while "Macro Cosmos" applies, remove from play the sent monster \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=837311)\].
    *   If this effect (or its activation) is negated (by "Royal Oppression" / "Gladiator Beast War Chariot"), do not send 1 monster from your hand to the Graveyard \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=797763&page=2)\].
    *   If an effect (ex: "Rivalry of Warlords", "Gozen Match", "Summon Limit") is chained such that "Quickdraw Synchron" cannot be summoned, NO monster is sent from your hand to the Graveyard.
        *   The key conjunction employed here is "_and_" and how "_do A and B_" is ruled by P.S.C.T. today.
        *   See "[Acorno](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Acorno)" for a comparable effect written with P.S.C.T.
*   This card's Ⓒ Conditions are not Effects. They cannot be negated.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① effect is an ignition effect. It activates, and can be chained to.
*   Sending a card to the GY is part of the ① effect. It happens when this effect resolves.
If you can't send, you can't Summon. If you can't Summon, you don't send.
(If the effect is negated, you don't send a card from your hand to the GY)
