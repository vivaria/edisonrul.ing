*   This ① optional "_When... you can..." Trigger Effect can miss the timing.
    *   This effect targets 1 or 2 cards on the field.
    *   The "_destroy_" and "_draw_" parts are considered to resolve simultaneously.

    *   If a target(s) cannot be destroyed, no card is drawn for it.
    *   Drawing a card(s) for your destroyed card(s) is OPTIONAL. Don't make irreparable gamestates...
    *   If a target changes control, its controller can draw 1 card when it is destroyed.
    *   If 2 of your cards were destroyed, you choose to draw 2 cards or 0 cards, you cannot draw 1 card.
