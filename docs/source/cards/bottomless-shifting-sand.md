# BOTTOMLESS SHIFTING SAND

*   If there are multiple monsters tied for the highest ATK, they are all destroyed.
*   If "Bottomless Shifting Sand" is active and "Tyrant Dragon" is the monster with the highest ATK, "Tyrant Dragon" is destroyed because "Bottomless Shifting Sand" does not target a monster.
