# Telekinetic Shocker

*   Paying 500 Life Points is a cost.
*   You pay 500 Life Points and destroy "Telekinetic Shocker" when a face-up Psychic-Type monster on the field would be destroyed, including a Psychic-Type monster your opponent controls. This effect does not use the Chain.
*   If 2 or more face-up Psychic-Type monsters would be destroyed by the same effect, you can destroy "Telekinetic Shocker" instead and the Psychic-Type monsters are not destroyed. If "Telekinetic Shocker" will also be destroyed by the same effect, you cannot use its effect.
