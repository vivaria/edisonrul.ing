# INSECT QUEEN

*   Insect Monster Tokens are placed during the End Phase for each monster "Insect Queen" destroyed that turn (1 for 1).
*   Insect Monster Tokens are placed during the End Phase, not during the Battle Phase when "Insect Queen" destroys a monster.
*   The Insect Monster Token is Special Summoned to the side of the field of the player who controls "Insect Queen" at the time the Insect Monster Token is Summoned, even if control of "Insect Queen" changed between the Battle Phase and the End Phase.
*   If "Insect Queen" destroys a monster but is not on the field during the End Phase, no Insect Monster Token is Special Summoned.
*   No Insect Monster Token is Special Summoned if it is impossible (due to "Jam Breeding Machine", etc.).
*   If you want to use "Royal Oppression" to negate the Special Summon of an Insect Monster Token, you chain it to the activation of "Insect Queen"’s effect during the End Phase.
*   If you Tribute "Pinch Hopper" to attack with Insect Queen, you can activate "Pinch Hopper"’s effect.
