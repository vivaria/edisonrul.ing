# WABOKU

*   "Waboku" makes Battle Damage dealt by your opponent's monsters to your monsters and to your Life Points become zero.
*   "Waboku" applies to ALL of the monsters on that player's side of the field for the entire turn.
*   To illustrate how "Waboku" works, here are some scenarios and their results:
*   SCENARIO 1: Player A's "Mega Thunderball" attacks Player B's "Mega Thunderball", and Player B activates "Waboku". RESULT: Player A's (attacking) "Mega Thunderball" is destroyed. Player B's "Mega Thunderball" (with equal ATK) is NOT destroyed.
*   SCENARIO 2: Player A activates "Waboku". Player A's "Mega Thunderball" then attacks Player B's "Mega Thunderball". RESULT: Player B's "Mega Thunderball" is destroyed. Player A's (attacking) "Mega Thunderball" is NOT destroyed. So you can use "Waboku" "offensively" when attacking an equal ATK monster.
*   SCENARIO 3: Player A activates "Waboku". Player A's "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" then attacks Player B's "Sanga of the Thunder". Player B uses "Sanga of the Thunder"'s effect (during the Damage Step). RESULT: Player A's "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (ATK 0) is not destroyed, nor does Player A lose any Life Points, because of Player A's "Waboku".
*   SCENARIO 4: Player A's "Mega Thunderball" attacks Player B's "Mega Thunderball". Player B activates "Fairy Box" or "Mirror Wall". Player A activates "Waboku". RESULT: Player A's "Mega Thunderball" (with reduced ATK) is not destroyed, nor does Player A lose any life points, because of Player A's "Waboku". But because Player A's "Mega Thunderball" had reduced ATK, Player B's "Mega Thunderball" is not destroyed either.
