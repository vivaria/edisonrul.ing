# Blackwing - Armor Master

> ① This card cannot be destroyed by battle, and you take no Battle Damage from battles involving this card. ② If this card attacks a monster, you can place 1 Wedge Counter on that monster at the end of the Damage Step (max. 1). ③ You can remove all Wedge Counters from your opponent's monsters to reduce the ATK and DEF of each monster that had a Wedge Counter to 0, until the End Phase.

*   This ① Continuous Effect can be negated by "Skill Drain".
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect places a "Wedge Counter" on a monster that battled Amor Master during Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step (when monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the Graveyard).
    *   This effect does not target the monster battling Armor Master.
    *   "Wedge Counters" fall off a monster if it is flipped face-down / leaves the field.
*   The ③ Ignition Effect removes all "Wedge Counters" from the field as cost.
    *   The ATK / DEF changes are reset when that monster is flipped face-down / leaves the field.
