# Master Gig

*   Paying 1000 Life Points is a cost to activate “Master Gig’s” effect. This effect does not target.
*   You determine the number of destroyed monsters based on the number of face-up Psychic monsters you control when this effect resolves.
*   If the number of monsters controlled by the opponent is less than the number of face-up Psychic monsters you control, you cannot activate “Master Gig’s” effect. If the effect has already been activated and you control more Psychic-Type monsters than your opponent has monsters when the effect resolves, you cannot destroy any of the opponent’s monsters.
