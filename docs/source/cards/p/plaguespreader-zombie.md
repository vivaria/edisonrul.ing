### Card Text

> ① You can return 1 card from your hand to the top of the Deck to Special Summon this card from the Graveyard. Ⓛ If you do, remove this card from play when it is removed from the field.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   Placing a card from your hand on top of the Deck is a cost.
    *   This effect does not target a card in the Graveyard. It is not negated by "Necrovalley".
*   The Ⓛ Lingering effect banishes this card when it would leave the field.  
    *   This does not start a chain.  
    *   This works like "Battle Fader"'s Condition - meaning that "Caius the Shadow Monarch" will not inflict Effect Damage if its effect banishes "Plaguespreader Zombie" summoned by the ① effect.  
    *   This effect disappears if "Plaguespreader Zombie" is flipped face-down.

### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① If this card is in your GY: You can place 1 card from your hand on the top of the Deck; Special Summon this card (banish it if it leaves the field).

### Card Rulings

On Activating the effect:
● This is an ignition effect, so you can Normal Summon a monster, and use this card's effect with ignition priority.
● This effect is not "Once per turn". If "Royal Oppression" is chained to this effect, your card is still returned to the top of your Deck (as it is a cost), and this effect can activate again on a new chain.

On Banishing this card:
● Once Summoned, it can't be sent to the GY as a cost (but it can be tributed, used as material, etc)
● Vs "Interdimensional Matter Transporter": This card won't return to the field.
● Vs "Caius the Shadow Monarch": If this card is banished this way, no damage is dealt.
● Vs "Book of Moon": "Banish it if it leaves the field" will no longer apply to this card.
