# Prohibition

> When you activate this card, declare 1 card name. Cards with that name and their effects cannot be used. Cards on the field before this card was activated are not affected (including face-down cards).

*   The effect declares a Card Name at activation. The declared card name cannot be changed.
    *   Cards (face-up / face-down) already on the field are unaffected.
    *   "Cyber Harpie Lady" cannot be declared, because its name is treated as "Harpie Lady". "A Legendary Ocean" cannot be declared, because its name is treated as "Umi".
    *   If "The Mask of Remnants" is declared with "Prohibition", when "Masked Beast Des Gardius" is sent to the Graveyard and its effect activates, "The Mask of Remnants" will be equipped from the Deck onto the opponent's monster.
*   The phrase "_cannot be used_" means that the declared card:
    *   can't be placed onto the field (face-up / face-down) from the hand / Extra Deck \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=612954&highlight=prohibition)\].
        *   "Metalzoa" or "Red-Eyes Black Metal Dragon" declared by "Prohibition" cannot be Special Summoned from the Deck.
        *   "Valkyrion the Magna Warrior", "The Fiend Megacyber", or "Gate Guardian" declared by "Prohibiton" cannot be Special Summoned from the hand.
        *   If a Ritual Monster is declared with "Prohibition", it cannot be Ritual Summoned.
    *   can't activate its effects in the hand (ex: "Thunder Dragon", "Honest") \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=612954&highlight=prohibition)\].
    *   can't activate its effects in the Graveyard, unless it was on the field before "Prohibition" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=612954&highlight=prohibition)\].
        *   Example 1: "Necro Gardna" is declared while it is in the Graveyard. Its effect cannot activate.
        *   Example 2: "Necro Gardna" is declared while it is on the field. Once it is sent to the Graveyard, it can activate its effect, even if "Prohibition" is still active.
        *   Example 3: If "Neko Mane King" is declared, its effect cannot activate when sent from the hand to the Graveyard by the opponent's effect, but will activate if it was on the field earlier.
    *   can't activate its effects while banished, unless it was on the field before "Prohibition" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=826293)\].
        *   Example 1: "Drill Warrior" is declared while it is removed from play by its effect. It will not Special Summon itself from the removed from play area during your next Standby Phase.
        *   Example 2: "Drill Warrior" is face-up on the field when "Prohibition" is activated. On your turn, "Drill Warrior" removes itself from play. It will Special Summon itself in your next Standby Phase, but it cannot Attack, change its battle position, activate its effects, or be used as Fusion / Synchro Material.
    *   can't be used as a Fusion / Synchro Material Monster (including "King of the Swamp") \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=612954&highlight=prohibition)\].
        *   NOTE: "Blackwing - Vayu the Emblem of Honor" does not perform a Synchro Summon, so if it was on the field when "Prohibition" was activated, it can activate its effect in the Graveyard.
*   If a declared monster is Special Summoned from the Deck / Graveyard / Banished:
    *   that monster's effects are not applied / cannot activate.
    *   that monster cannot be used as a Fusion / Synchro Material Monster.
    *   that monster cannot attack / change its battle position manually (ex: Flip Summon).
    *   that monster's maintainence costs must still be paid.
*   If "Prohibition" is negated (by "Spell Canceller"):
    *   players can "_use_" the declared card.
    *   a named monster Special Summoned face-down can be Flip Summoned.
    *   If "Prohibition" is no longer negated, any declared card(s) on the field remain unaffected.
*   VS. "Exodia the Forbidden One": when a player has all five pieces of Exodia in their hand, they win the Duel. This is a win condition and cannot be prevented with "Prohibition" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=612954&highlight=prohibition)\].
*   VS: "Parasite Paracide": After being shuffled into your opponent's Deck, if "Prohibition" is activated and declares "Parasite Paracide", when your opponent draws "Parasite Paracide" its effect is applied because its Flip Effect had already resolved \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=612954&highlight=prohibition)\].
