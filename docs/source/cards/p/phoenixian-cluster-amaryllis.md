### Card Rulings

● The ③ effect is not "once per turn", so if it is negated by "Royal Oppression", it can be activated again in the same End Phase.
(Banishing a plant is a cost, so even if it is negated this way, the plant remains banished).
● The ① is not an activated effect. It happens at the start of Substep 5, before chains are built.
