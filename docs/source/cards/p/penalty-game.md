### Card Rulings

*   Penalty Game! only requires your opponent to have 4 cards in hand when it is activated, not when it resolves. So your opponent can activate Jar of Greed to have 5 cards, or chain a Quick-Play Spell Card from his hand and have 3 cards, and Penalty Game! will still resolve.
*   If you choose the first effect, neither player can activate a card that would require the opponent to draw during their next Draw Phase, such as Jar of Greed or Disturbance Strategy.
*   If the second effect of Penalty Game! is chosen, the opponent can still activate the effects of cards that are already face-up on the field, such as Skull Lair or The Dragon’s Bead.
