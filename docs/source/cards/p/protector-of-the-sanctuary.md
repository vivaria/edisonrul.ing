# Protector Of The Sanctuary

*   Your opponent cannot draw with "Airknight Parshath" while you control "Protector of the Sanctuary".
*   Most cards that would cause the opponent to draw outside of the Draw Phase, such as "Card Destruction", cannot be activated, even by the controller of "Protector of the Sanctuary". However, effects that are forcibly activated, like "Morphing Jar", can be activated (but results may vary; see below).
*   If "Protector of the Sanctuary" is on the field, then Flip Effects like "Morphing Jar" will still activate because they must activate when the monster is flipped (whether it was Flip Summoned, flipped by an attack, or flipped by "Book of Taiyou", etc.).
*   If "Morphing Jar"'s effect activates, then both players discard their hands, but if you control "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent does not draw a new hand.
*   You cannot activate cards if they make your opponent draw, such as "Dragged Down Into the Grave", "Card Destruction", or "Disturbance Strategy".
*   "Protector of the Sanctuary" prevents your opponent from drawing with "Mirage of Nightmare". However, your opponent can still activate "Mirage of Nightmare", "Appropriate", etc., even though he cannot use their effects at that time.
*   If you control "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent cannot activate "Super Rejuvenation", "Jar Robber", "Monster Recovery", or "Reload" outside of the Draw Phase.
*   If you control "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent CAN activate "Reload", "Jar of Greed", "Reckless Greed", etc., during the Draw Phase (either player's).
*   If you have "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent can activate cards like "Gamble" that are random as to whether he can draw, but he cannot draw even if he wins the coin toss.
*   You can chain "Call of the Haunted" to a card effect that would make your opponent draw, and if you Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent does not draw.
*   If you have "Protector of the Sanctuary" and your "Bistro Butcher" inflicts damage to your opponent, your opponent doesn't draw.
*   You cannot activate "Heavy Slump" while you control a face-up "Protector of the Sanctuary".
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Reckless Greed" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", you cannot draw for the effect of "Reckless Greed" because of the "Protector of the Sanctuary", so you do not draw and you do not skip 2 Draw Phases.
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Disturbance Strategy" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent adds his hand to the Deck and shuffles it by the effect of "Disturbance Strategy", but "Protector of the Sanctuary" prevents him from drawing.
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Upstart Goblin" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", you cannot draw 1 card and your opponent does not gain 1000 Life Points.
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Reload" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent adds his hand to his Deck and shuffles it, but "Protector of the Sanctuary" prevents him from drawing.
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Graceful Charity" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", you cannot draw for the effect of "Graceful Charity" and you do not discard 2 cards.
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Mind Wipe" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent adds his hand to the Deck and shuffles, but cannot draw any cards.
