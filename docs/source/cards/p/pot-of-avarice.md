### Card Text

> Select 5 Monster Cards in your Graveyard. Return those cards to the Deck, then draw 2 cards.

### Card Rulings

*   This effect targets 5 monsters in your Graveyard. This effect is negated by "Necrovalley".
*   Synchro and Fusion Monsters targeted are returned to the Extra Deck.
*   If a target(s) cannot be returned to the Main / Extra Deck, then no targets are returned to the Deck and you do not draw 2 cards.
*   This card CANNOT be activated while the player has 1 or 0 cards remaining in their Deck \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=850460)\].
*   VS. "Transmigration Break": This card cannot be activated. If "Transmigration Break" is chained to "Pot of Avarice", the targets are removed from play instead of being shuffled into the Main / Extra Deck(s), and since those cards were not shuffled into the Deck(s) the player does not draw 2 cards.
*   VS. “Serial Spell”: You select 5 targets for “Pot of Avarice”, and then when you chain “Serial Spell” you must select 5 targets. You can select the same monsters, but if you do this then “Serial Spell” will resolve first and shuffle some monsters back into the Deck, and then when the original “Pot of Avarice” tries to resolves, there aren’t enough monsters left so it will not resolve. Monster Cards you discard from your hand for the cost of “Serial Spell” can be targeted for the “Serial Spell” copy of “Pot of Avarice”.
