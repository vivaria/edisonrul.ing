### Card Text

> Negate the activation and effect of an Effect Monster whose effect activated when a monster was Normal Summoned (even itself), and destroy that Effect Monster.

### Card Rulings

*   This effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Zaborg the Thunder Monarch").
*   If a monster effect activates in response to a Normal Summon (ex: "King Tiger Wanghu"), you can activate this card.
*   This effect does not target.
*   When a Normal Summoned monster activates its effect (ex: “Caius the Shadow Monarch”) while “Light and Darkness Dragon” is face-up, the effect of the Summoned monster will be Chain Link 1 and “Light and Darkness Dragon” will be Chain Link 2. Therefore, “Pulling the Rug” cannot activate as it cannot negate the effect of the Special Summoned monster.
*   This card cannot be activated in response to an Ignition Effect activated in the Summon response timing via Ignition Effect Priority.

### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① If a Monster Effect is triggered because a monster was Normal Summoned:
> Negate the activation, and if you do, destroy the monster that activated that effect.

### Card Rulings

This card can only negate trigger effects which specifically activate when a monster is Normal Summoned.
*   It can negate the effects of cards like "Caius the Shadow Monarch", "Armageddon Knight" (if it was Normal Summoned), or "Dark Verger".
*   It can't negate Ignition effects, even if activated with ignition Priority.
It can never negate the effect of "Substitoad", "Dark Grepher", nor "D.D. Crow".
*   It can't negate an effect which activated because a monster was Special Summoned, even if that monster's effect states "if this card is Normal/Special Summoned".
