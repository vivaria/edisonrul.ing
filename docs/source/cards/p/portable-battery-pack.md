# Portable Battery Pack

*   If an effect is chained that removes 1 of the 2 targeted "Batteryman" monsters from the Graveyard, the remaining "Batteryman" monster is Special Summoned. When this "Batteryman" monster is removed from the field, "Portable Battery Pack" is destroyed.
*   If 1 of the 2 Special Summoned "Batteryman" monsters is flipped face-down, when the remaining "Batteryman" monster is removed from the field, "Portable Battery Pack" is destroyed. The "Batteryman" that was flipped face-down remains on the field.
*   If an effect is chained so that you have only 1 empty Monster Card Zone when “Portable Battery Pack” resolves,, choose 1 of the 2 targeted "Batteryman" monsters to be Special Summoned; the other remains in the Graveyard.
