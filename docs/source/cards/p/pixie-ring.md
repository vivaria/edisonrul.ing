*   Even if your monster with the lowest ATK is in Defense Position while “Pixie Ring” is active, it cannot be selected as an attack target. If all monsters you control have the same ATK while “Pixie Ring” is active, your opponent cannot declare an attack (except with monsters that can attack directly such as Earthbound Immortals, “Jinzo #7” etc.)
