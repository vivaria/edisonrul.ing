### Card Rulings

*   "Primal Seed" can add cards to your hand that were removed from play face-up ("Dimensionhole") or face-down ("Different Dimension Capsule").
*   You target the 2 removed cards when you activate "Primal Seed".
*   If you don't have 2 or more cards removed from play, you cannot activate "Primal Seed".
*   A Fusion Monster or Synrho Monster selected with Primal Seed returns to the Extra Deck.
*   The required card only needs to be face-up on the field. It does not need to be a Monster Card, so if “Black Luster Soldier – Envoy of the Beginning” is equipped to “Relinquished”, you can activate “Primal Seed”.
