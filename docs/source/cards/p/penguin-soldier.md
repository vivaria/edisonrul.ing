# Penguin Soldier

*   You may choose to return 0, 1, or 2 monsters to their owners’ hands.
*   You may target Monster Tokens, and they will be taken off the field, instead of returning to the hand.
*   Spirit Monsters can still be returned to their owners’ hands by the effect of "Penguin Soldier" even if "Spiritual Energy Settle Machine" is in play.
