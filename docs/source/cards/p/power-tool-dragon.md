# Power Tool Dragon

> ① Once per turn, during your Main Phase, you can select 3 Equip Spell Cards from your Deck, have your opponent pick 1 of them at random, and add it to your hand. Return the remaining cards to your Deck. ② If this card would be destroyed while equipped with an Equip Spell Card, you can send that card to the Graveyard instead.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   You reveal the 3 Equip Spell Cards from your Deck that you pick. From that point on, you do not have to show them (so your opponent does not see them while picking randomly).
    *   You cannot activate this effect while “Thunder King Rai-Oh” is active. If you activate the effect, and an effect is chained which places “Thunder King Rai-Oh” on the field, proceed with “Power Tool Dragon’s” effect but the 1 picked card goes to the Graveyard instead of your hand.
    *   Adding a card to your hand and returning 2 cards to the Deck happen at the same time.
    *   “Drastic Drop Off” can be activated after this effect resolves.
*   The ② Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   You can send your opponent’s Equip Spell Card equipped to this card to the Graveyard.
    *   This effect applies even while "Macro Cosmos" is active. The equipped card is removed from play.
    *   If “Power Tool Dragon” and the equipped card would be destroyed at the same time (by “Judgment Dragon”), you cannot send the Equip Spell Card to the Graveyard.
    *   If “Power Tool Dragon” is equipped only with “Blast Sphere,” you cannot send “Blast Sphere” to the Graveyard to prevent “Power Tool Dragon” from being destroyed by “Blast Sphere.” If “Power Tool Dragon” is equipped with “Blast Sphere” and another Equip Spell Card, you can send the other Equip Spell Card to the Graveyard to protect “Power Tool Dragon.” In that case, “Blast Sphere” is destroyed, but no damage is inflicted for “Blast Sphere’s” effect.
    *   If you send "Double Tool C&D" to the Graveyard, the effect of “Double Tool C&D” that destroys the opponent’s monster does not activate, because it is not on the field at the end of the Damage Step.
    *   An equipped “Archfiend of Gilfer” can be sent to the Graveyard. You can activate the effect of “Archfiend of Gilfer” and re-equip it to a monster on the field (including “Power Tool Dragon”), unless it was sent to the Graveyard during the middle of a Chain, because it misses the timing.
