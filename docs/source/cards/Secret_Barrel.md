# SECRET BARREL

*   If you activate "Secret Barrel" and your opponent activates something as a chain, the chained card is included in the number (so if your opponent's only card on the field or in his hand is "Mystical Space Typhoon", and he chains "Mystical Space Typhoon" to "Secret Barrel", he still takes 200 damage).
*   Monster Tokens are counted for "Secret Barrel".
