# DIVINE WRATH

> Discard 1 card from your hand. Negate the activation of an Effect Monster's effect, and destroy that Effect Monster.

*   This card can be activated any time during the turn, including the Damage Step and end of turn discard.
*   If an attacking monster or the monster being attacked is destroyed by this card, no replay occurs. If damage calculation has not been performed yet, it is not performed.
*   This card will only negate the activation of the monster Effect that preceeds it in the Chain.
*   This card can negate the effect of a Spirit Monster that returns it to its ownerâ€™s hand.
*   If this card negates "Treeborn Frog"'s effect, its effect can be activated again in that Standby Phase.
*   This card cannot negate the effect of an equipped Union Monster that would Special Summon itself as a monster, because that is an effect of an Equip Spell Card.
*   This card cannot negate a monster's Continuous Effect, such as "Goblin Attack Force" going to Defense Position after declaring an attack, as these effects do not activate.
