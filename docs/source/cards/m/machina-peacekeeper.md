# Machina Peacekeeper

> ① When this card on the field is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, you can add 1 Union Monster from your Deck to your hand. (2A) Once per turn, during your Main Phase, you can equip this card to a Machine-Type monster you control as an Equip Card, OR (2B) unequip it to Special Summon this card in face-up Attack Position. (Ⓒ A monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. ③ If the equipped monster would be destroyed, destroy this card instead.)

*   This ① optional Trigger Effect CAN miss the timing.
    *   This effect will only activate if the last thing to happen was Peacekeeper's destruction.
    *   You cannot activate this effect if you do not have any Union Monsters remaining in your Deck.
    *   This effect will activate if Peacekeeper is equipped to a monster that gets flipped face-down.
*   The (2A) Ignition Effect targets a Machine-Type monster you control.
    *   If the target is no longer Machine-Type, Peacekeeper is destroyed by game mechanic.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down / leaves the field, Peacekeeper is destroyed by game mechanic.
    *   If the equipped monster is flipped face-down / leaves the field, Peacekeeper is destroyed by game mechanic immediately.
    *   A Union Monster that is attached to a monster is treated as an Equip Spell Card.
    *   If "Dimensional Fissure" is active when an equipped Union Monster is sent to the Graveyard, it will not be banished, because it was treated as a Spell and not a monster \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=16273125&postcount=4)\].
*   The (2B) Ignition-like Effect is the effect of a Equip Spell Card.
    *   If you have no open Monster Card Zone when this effect resolves, send this card to the Graveyard.
    *   If the equipped monster is flipped face-down / leaves the field before this effect resolves, this card is immediately destroyed and sent to the Graveyard and is not Special Summoned.
    *   You can activate this effect even if your opponent controls the equipped monster.
*   The Ⓒ Condition applies always. A monster can never be equipped with more than 1 Union Monster.  
    
*   The ③ Continuous-like Effect is the effect of a Equip Spell Card.
    *   Apply this effect if the equipped monster would be destroyed by battle or card effect.  
    *   If an effect (ex: "Black Rose Dragon") would simultaneously destroy Peacekeeper and the equipped Machine-Type monster; destroy both cards, you CANNOT apply this effect \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=18956551&postcount=2)\].  
    *   This does not apply if the equipped monster would be removed from play, returned to the hand / Deck, or flipped face-down by a card effect.
