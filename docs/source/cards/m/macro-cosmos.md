### Card Text

> ① You can Special Summon 1 “Helios – The Primordial Sun” from your hand or Deck when you activate this card. ② While this card is on the field, any card sent to the Graveyard is removed from play instead.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Effect is optional, you can activate this card without a Helios in the Deck.
    *   "Macro Cosmos" must remain face-up on the Field in order to successfully resolve its ① effect.
    *   Because of this effect, "Macro Cosmos" can be destroyed on activation by "Royal Oppression".
*   The ② Continuous-like Effect affects all cards that would be sent to the Graveyard.
    *   A Monster Tributed to Normal Summon "Jinzo" is still removed from play.
    *   Cards cannot be sent / discarded to the Graveyard. If a card's cost would do this, it cannot activate.
    *   Cards whose cost require a card(s) be discarded (ex: "Magic Jammer") can be activated.
    *   Cards / effects that send / discard a card(s) to the Graveyard at resolution can be activated.
        *   Examples: "Dark Grepher", "Foolish Burial", "Blaze Accelerator", and "Needlebug Nest".
    *   If a face-up "Archlord Kristya" would be sent from the field to the Graveyard (and removed from play), "Archlord Kristya’s" effect will still trigger and places it back on top of the Deck.
    *   If "Gravekeeper's Servant" is active, your opponent cannot declare an attack.
