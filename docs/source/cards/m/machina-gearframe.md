### Card Text

> ① When this card is Normal Summoned, you can add 1 "Machina" monster, except "Machina Gearframe", from your Deck to your hand. (2A) Once per turn, during your Main Phase, you can equip this card to a Machine-Type monster you control as an Equip Card, OR (2B) unequip it to Special Summon this card in face-up Attack Position. (Ⓒ A monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. ③ If the equipped monster would be destroyed, destroy this card instead.)

### Card Rulings

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Trap Hole").
*   The "_When... you can..._" effect can miss the timing if "Machina Gearframe" is Normal Summoned as Chain Link 2+ by the effect of "Ultimate Offering".
*   The (2A) Ignition Effect targets a Machine-Type monster you control.
*   If the target is no longer Machine-Type, Gearframe is destroyed by game mechanic.
*   If the target is flipped face-down / leaves the field, Gearframe is destroyed by game mechanic.
*   If the equipped monster is flipped face-down / leaves the field, Gearframe is destroyed by game mechanic immediately.
*   A Union Monster that is attached to a monster is treated as an Equip Spell Card.
*   If "Dimensional Fissure" is active when an equipped Union Monster is sent to the Graveyard, it will not be banished, because it was treated as a Spell and not a monster \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=16273125&postcount=4)\].
*   The (2B) Ignition-like Effect is the effect of a Equip Spell Card.
*   If you have no open Monster Card Zone when this effect resolves, send this card to the Graveyard.
*   If the equipped monster is flipped face-down / leaves the field before this effect resolves, this card is immediately destroyed and sent to the Graveyard and is not Special Summoned.
*   You can activate this effect even if your opponent controls the equipped monster.
*   The Ⓒ Condition applies always. A monster can never be equipped with more than 1 Union Monster.
*   The ③ Continuous-like Effect is the effect of a Equip Spell Card.
*   Apply this effect if the equipped monster would be destroyed by battle or card effect.
*   If an effect (ex: "Black Rose Dragon") would simultaneously destroy Gearframe and the equipped Machine-Type monster; destroy both cards, you CANNOT apply this effect \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=18956551&postcount=2)\].
*   This does not apply if the equipped monster would be removed from play, returned to the hand / Deck, or flipped face-down by a card effect.
