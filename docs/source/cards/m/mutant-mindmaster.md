### Card Text

> ① When this card declares an attack, you can take control of 1 face-up Attack Position monster your opponent controls, and attack with it instead of this monster. Ⓒ It cannot attack your opponent directly. Return it to your opponent at the end of the Battle Phase.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates and resolves in the Battle Step (Substep 1 - Attack Declaration)
    *   This effect targets 1 face-up Attack Position monster your opponent controls.
        *   A monster that cannot attack cannot be targeted by this effect.
    *   The monster that changed control can attack (in place of "Mutant Mindmaster"), choose the attack target and enter the Damage Step. This DOES NOT cause a REPLAY to occur.
    *   If "Magic Cylinder" is activated in Chain to the effect of "Mutant Mindmaster", the attack of "Mutant Mindmaster" will be negated, but the effect of "Mutant Mindmaster" will not be negated, so the effect will resolve as normal. (The targeted monster changes control, and if it can attack, it performs damage calculation with an opponent's monster.)
