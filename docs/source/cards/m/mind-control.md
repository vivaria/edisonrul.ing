# Mind Control

> Take control of 1 monster your opponent controls until the End Phase. It cannot declare an attack or be Tributed.

*   This effect targets 1 (face-up / face-down) monster your opponent controls.  
    
*   If the targeted monster was Special Summoned this turn (by "Call of the Haunted"), you can change its Battle Position when you gain control of it \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=1127248)\].  
    
*   Control of the target changes even if it isflipped face-up / face-down before "Mind Control" resolves.  
    
*   The effect "it cannot declare an attack or be Tributed" is an effect that is applied until the End Phase of the turn "Mind Control" is applied.
*   The target can be used as a Synchro Material Monster or a Fusion Material Monster.
*   The target can be removed from play / sent to the Graveyard / returned to the Deck for a cost / effect.
*   Returningcontrol of the monster in the End Phase does not start a chain, this occurs even if the monster was flipped face-up / face-down.  
    
*   A card with an effect of "Control of this face-up card on the field cannot switch" cannot switch control while face-up under any circumstances. So, if a face-down Botanical Lion changes control due to Mind Control and is then flipped face-up, the lingering part of the effect of Mind Control will not apply during the End Phase and control of Botanical Lion will not return to the original owner.
