# Majestic Star Dragon

*   If you negate the effects of a monster with “Majestic Star Dragon” you can only activate 1 of the monster’s effects 1 time.
*   The effect to return “Majestic Star Dragon” to the Extra Deck is mandatory. It activates even if an effect that prohibits Special Summons is applied. In that case, you return “Majestic Star Dragon” to the Extra Deck but will not Special Summon “Stardust Dragon.”
*   If “G.B. Hunter” is on the field, the effect to return “Majestic Star Dragon” to the Extra Deck will activate and resolve without effect.
*   If you activate the effect of the monster that “Majestic Star Dragon” negated it will start a Chain. “Divine Wrath” can be used against this effect and will destroy “Majestic Star Dragon” in this case.
*   The effect to Special Summon “Stardust Dragon” targets the “Stardust Dragon.” It activates even if there is no “Stardust Dragon” in the Graveyard.
*   If you negate the effect of a monster and then take control of that monster with another effect, the monster’s effect is still negated.
