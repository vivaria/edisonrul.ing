### Card Rulings

*   All of this card's effects are continuous (Do not start a chain).

About the ① effect:
*   If the activation of a Spell card is negated (e.g. by "Solemn Judgment" or "Gladiator Beast Heraklinos"), a Spell Counter will not be put on this card.
If the effect of a Spell Card is negated (e.g. by "Royal Oppression" or "Imperial Order"), a Spell Counter is still added to this card)
*   A Spell Counter will not be added to this card when a Spell effect is activated (e.g. "Blaze Acellerator" or "Miracle Fertilizer"), only when the Spell card itself is activated (place on the field).

About the ② effect:
*   A Spell Counter will be put on this card even if an opponent's card with Spell Counters is destroyed.

About the ③ effect:
*   You may only apply this effect for effects that remove Spell Counters as a cost to activate that effect (e.g. "Dark Valkyria", "Breaker the Magical Warrior", "Royal Magical Library", etc). It cannot be applied for effects that remove a Spell Counter (e.g. "Mythical Beast Cerberus").
*   If your card with an effect that removes Spell Counters for cost has no Spell Counters on it (e.g. "Breaker the Magical Warrior"), you can still activate the effect, removing a Spell Counter from this card.

About the ④ effect:
*   This effect can only be applied if this card would be destroyed by card effect. It cannot be applied if your opponent activates a Field Spell.
