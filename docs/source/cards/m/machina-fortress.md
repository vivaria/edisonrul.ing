    *   You can discard "Machina Fortress" as part of the cost to perform this Special Summon.
    *   This Summon can be performed while "Macro Cosmos" / "Dimensional Fissure" is active.
    *   If "Macro Cosmos" / "Dimensional Fissure" is active, you cannot discard "Machina Fortress" and another Machine-Type monster to Special Summon that copy of "Machina Fortress", since after being discarded "Machina Fortress" will be removed from play.

    *   This effect targets 1 card on your opponent's field.
    *   This effect cannot activate if this card is removed from play instead.

    *   If multiple copies of "Machina Fortresses" were targeted by your opponent's “Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier”, you first decide whether or not you want to Chain any effects. Then, when you go to resolve the effect of Brionac, first look at your opponent’s hand and discard 1 card from it for each "Machina Fortress" that was targeted. Finally, resolve Brionac’s effect.
