# Mermaid Archer

*   “Mermaid Archer’s” effect to equip itself targets the Level 3 or lower monster you control.
*   If “Imperial Order” or “Spell Canceller” are active, “Mermaid Archer” still gains the 800 ATK from a monster equipped to it.
*   If “Mermaid Archer” and the monster equipped to it would be destroyed at the same time (by “Judgment Dragon,” for example), you cannot destroy the equipped monster to save “Mermaid Archer.”
*   Only monsters equipped to “Mermaid Archer” by “Mermaid Archer’s” own effect can be destroyed instead of “Mermaid Archer.”
*   If “Mermaid Archer” is equipped with a monster by its own effect, and also equipped with “Metallizing Parasite – Lunatite” at the same time, and it would be destroyed, “Metallizing Parasite – Lunatite” automatically destroys itself with its effect, so you cannot choose to destroy the other monster equipped to “Mermaid Archer.”
