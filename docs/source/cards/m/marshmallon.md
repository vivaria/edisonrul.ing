### Card Text

> ① The controller of a monster that attacks this face-down card takes 1000 damage after damage calculation. ② This card cannot be destroyed by battle. (Damage calculation is applied normally.)

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Trigger Effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation.
*   This effect forms a Chain with effects (like “Airknight Parshath”) that activate at the same time.
*   This effect is mandatory. It activates even if your opponent cannot take effect damage.
*   The ② Continuous Effect does not activate.
*   This card can still be destroyed by card effects, like that of “Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke”.
*   If a face-down “Marshmallon” attacked while “Gorgon’s Eye” applies will have its effects negated.
