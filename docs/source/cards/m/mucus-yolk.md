# Mucus Yolk

*   Zero damage is not damage, so "Mucus Yolk" must have its ATK increased somehow in order to inflict damage to the opponent and activate its effect.
*   "Mucus Yolk" can continue to activate its effect over and over again, as long as it keeps inflicting Battle Damage to the opponent.
*   If "Mucus Yolk" inflicts damage multiple times in the same turn, such as with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light – Tryce", it only increases by 1000 points during your next Standby Phase.
