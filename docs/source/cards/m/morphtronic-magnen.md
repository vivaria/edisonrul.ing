# Morphtronic Magnen

*   If you control an Attack Position "Morphtronic Magnen" and another monster, when your opponent attacks the other monster and and effect is activated that changes "Morphtronic Magnen" into Defense Position, the other monster is still attacked because it has already been selected as an attack target.
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, the Attack Position and Defense Position effects of "Morphtronic Magnen" cannot be activated, because the "While in Attack Position" and "While in Defense Position" effects are negated.
*   If your opponent controls "Command Knight" and another monster with less ATK, your "Morphtronic Magnen" cannot attack because it cannot attack the "Command Knight".
*   If your opponent controls a monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" and another monster with higher ATK, your "Morphtronic Magnen" must attack the monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" if it attacks.
*   If you control a "Morphtronic Magnen" equipped with "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" and your opponent controls a face-up monster, your "Morphtronic Magnen" can only attack your opponent's monster. It cannot attack directly.
*   If you control 2 or more "Morphtronic Magnens" in Defense Position, your opponent cannot attack, unless they control a monster that can attack directly due to an effect.
