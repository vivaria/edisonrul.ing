### Card Rulings

*   “Mysterious Triangle” targets the monster it destroys. If “Vanity’s Fiend” is preventing Special Summons, and it has an A-Counter, you can destroy it with “Mysterious Triangle” then Special Summon an Alien. If an effect is chained to “Mysterious Triangle” that removes the target’s A-Counter, it is not destroyed. (Example: if it is flipped face-down with “Book of Moon”.) If the targeted monster is not destroyed for some reason, no Alien is Special Summoned.
