# Morphtronic Map

*   Placing Morph Counters on this card does not start a chain. Special Summoning 1 “Morphtronic” monster with this card’s effect does start a chain, and does target. If you activate another Field Spell Card to replace your “Morphtronic Map”, the effect of “Morphtronic Map” misses the timing and no “Morphtronic” monster is Special Summoned. However, if you Set a Field Spell Card to replace your “Morphtronic Map”, the timing is not missed, and “Morphtronic Map” can Special Summon 1 “Morphtronic” monster. If your opponent activates a Field Spell Card and destroys your “Morphtronic Map”, the effect of “Morphtronic Map” activates and you can Special Summon 1 “Morphtronic” monster. If your opponent Sets a Field Spell Card, your “Morphtronic Map” is not destroyed at all, so of course no “Morphtronic” monster is Special Summoned. If multiple monsters have their battle positions changed at the same time, only 1 Morph Counter is placed on this card. If “Level Limit – Area B” is in effect, and you change a Level 4+ monster’s battle position to Attack Position (and it immediately changes back to Defense Position due to “Level Limit – Area B”, only 1 Morph Counter is added to “Morphtronic Map”.
*   No Morph Counters are placed on “Morphtronic Map” when a monster is flipped from face-down Defense Position to face-up Defense Position, since its battle position is unchanged.
