### Card Rulings

*   If you attack with your "Mother Grizzly" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you may attack with the monster Special Summoned by "Mother Grizzly" before entering Main Phase 2.
*   If your opponent controls your "Mother Grizzly" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you get the effect of "Mother Grizzly" NOT your opponent.
*   Since the Special Summoning occurs during the Damage Step, "Torrential Tribute", etc. cannot be used.

> ① If destroyed by battle and sent to the GY:
> You can Special Summon 1 WATER with 1500 or less ATK from your Deck, in Attack Position.

### Card Rulings

● This effect activates in the Damage Step, so it can never be negated by "Royal Oppression".
Cards like "Bottomless Trap Hole" and "Torrential Tribute" can never be used in response to this Summon.
