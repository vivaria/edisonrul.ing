*   "Morphtronic Clocken"'s Defense Position effect to inflict damage cannot be activated if it does not have any Morph Counters.
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, the Attack Position and Defense Position effects of "Morphtronic Radion" cannot be activated, because the "While in Attack Position" and "While in Defense Position" effects are negated.
*   If you activate "Morphtronic Clocken"'s effect to gain a Morph Counter and an effect is chained that changes it to Attack Position, it still gains a Morph Counter.
