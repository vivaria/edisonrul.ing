### Card Rulings

1. If you control "Machina Sniper" and both players have 'Machina' monsters on their fields, neither player can attack 'Machina' monsters except "Machina Sniper".
2. If a face-down 'Machina' monster is attacked while "Machina Sniper" is on the field, the attack will proceed as normal because the monster is not flipped face-up until the Damage Step.
3. If a face-down 'Machina' monster is attacked while "Machina Sniper" is on the field, but the monster is flipped face-up by "Ceasefire" before the Damage Step, the attack is canceled because of the effect of "Machina Sniper".
