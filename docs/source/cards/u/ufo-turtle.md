# Ufo Turtle

*   If you attack with your "UFO Turtle" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you may attack with the monster Special Summoned by "UFO Turtle" before entering Main Phase 2.
*   If your opponent controls your "UFO Turtle" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you get the effect of "UFO Turtle" NOT your opponent.
*   Since the Special Summoning occurs during the Damage Step, "Torrential Tribute", etc. cannot be used.

### Card Rulings

● This effect activates in the Damage Step, so it can never be negated by "Royal Oppression".
Cards like "Bottomless Trap Hole" and "Torrential Tribute" can never be used in response to this Summon.
