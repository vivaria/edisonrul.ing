# Ultimate Tyranno

*   If you have 2 or more “Ultimate Tyranno” in Attack Position at the start of your Battle Phase, you choose 1 and it attacks all of your opponent’s monsters first.
*   Either player may activate effects during the Battle Phase before "Ultimate Tyranno" attacks, as well as during, or in between its attacks.
*   If "Ultimate Tyranno" attacks and destroys an opponent's "Mystic Tomato" and they use its effect to Special Summon another monster, then "Ultimate Tyranno" must also attack the newly Summoned monster.
