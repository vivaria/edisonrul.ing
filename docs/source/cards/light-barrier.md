# LIGHT BARRIER

*   "Light Barrier"'s effect to flip a coin during the Standby Phase starts a Chain.
*   The effect of the Summoned "Arcana Force" monster still starts a Chain, but you do not toss the coin. When the effect resolves you will select if the heads or tails effect is applied.
*   If an "Arcana Force" monster's effect is chosen in this way, it cannot be selected with "Reversal of Fate" or "Arcana Call".
*   "Light Barrier"'s effect to gain Life Points starts a Chain when the opponent's monster is sent to the Graveyard or Removed Zone at the end of the Damage Step.
*   If your "Arcana Force" monster is also destroyed in the battle, "Light Barrier"'s effect still activates.
*   Only the controller of "Light Barrier" activates its effects.
