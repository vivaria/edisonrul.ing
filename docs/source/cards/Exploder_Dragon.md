# EXPLODER DRAGON  
> ① When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, destroy the monster that destroyed it. ② While this card is attacking, any Battle Damage either player takes from a battle involving this card becomes 0.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect does not target the monster that destroyed this card.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step (like "Masked Dragon").
    *   This effect will not activate if this card is removed from play instead of being sent to the Graveyard.
    *   This effect will not activate if it is destroyed by a card's effect.
*   The ② Continuous Effect only applies on your turn, while this card is attacking.
