# Koa’Ki Meiru Ice

*   The first sentence of this card is a maintenance cost, not an effect. It does not start a Chain.
*   Sending a card from your hand to the Graveyard is a cost to activate this monster’s effect.
*   This effect targets 1 Special Summoned monster on the field.
*   Even if a Special Summoned monster is flipped face-down, you can destroy it later with “Koa’ki Meiru Ice.”
