If you activate this effect you cannot conduct your Battle Phase this turn. ② During your Standby Phase, if this card is in your Graveyard you can remove from play 1 "Destiny Hero" card from your Graveyard to Special Summon this card.

*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated.
    *   If this card is Fusion Summoned, the Fusion Material Monsters must be correct.
    *   Once Fusion Summoned, Dragoon can be Summoned from the Graveyard / removed from play.
    *   This card can be Special Summoned by "Summoner of Illusions" / "Metamorphosis", but it cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard / removed from play if it leaves the field.

    *   This effect targets the opponent's (face-up / face-down) monster.
