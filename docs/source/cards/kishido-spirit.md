# KISHIDO SPIRIT

*   If your monster in Defense Position is attacked by a monster with equal ATK to your monster's ATK, your Defense Position monster will not be destroyed even if its DEF was lower than the attacking monster's ATK.
*   When "Spear Dragon" attacks a Defense Position monster with equal ATK to "Spear Dragon", perform damage calculation normally even though the Defense Position monster is not destroyed.
