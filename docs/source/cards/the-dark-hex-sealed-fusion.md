    *   This card cannot be sent to the Graveyard to when Special Summoning "Chimeratech Fortress Dragon" or "XYZ-Dragon Cannon".
    *   If "The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion" is named by "Prohibition", you cannot use its effect.

    *   This effect does not perform a Fusion Summon, so it can activate while "Non-Fusion Area" applies, but it cannot Special Summon “Dark Paladin”.
    *   The Fusion Monster Summoned by this effect cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard / removed from play, since it was not "properly" Fusion Summoned.
