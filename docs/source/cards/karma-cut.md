# KARMA CUT

> Discard 1 card. Remove from play 1 face-up monster your opponent controls. Then, remove from play any cards in your opponent's Graveyard with the same name as that monster.

*   Discarding a card from your hand is a cost.
*   This card can be activated while your opponent controls "Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer".
*   This effect targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down, it is not removed from play, nor are any copies in their Graveyard.
    *   If you gain control of the target before this effect resolves, it is not removed from play.
    *   If “Proto-Cyber Dragon” is removed from play, copies of “Cyber Dragon” are not affected.
    *   “Harpie Lady”, “Harpie Lady 1”, “Harpie Lady 2”, “Harpie Lady 3”, or “Cyber Harpie Lady” have the same name in the Graveyard. If one is removed from play, others in the Graveyard are affected.
