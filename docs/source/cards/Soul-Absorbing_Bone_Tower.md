# SOUL-ABSORBING BONE TOWER

*   If you have a "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" equipped with "Raregold Armor" and a Zombie-Type monster, your opponent cannot attack. Even if you have a Zombie-Type monster, "Gemini Elf", and a "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" equipped with "Raregold Armor", your opponent cannot attack.
*   If you have another Zombie-Type monster and "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower", your opponent cannot attack the "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower", but if you equip the "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" with "Ring of Magnetism" your opponent can declare an attack but must attack the "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" equipped with the "Ring of Magnetism".
*   If you have multiple "Soul-Absorbing Bone Towers" and no other monsters, your opponent cannot attack.
*   When your opponent attacks your "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" and during the Battle Step you activate "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon another Zombie-Type monster, then a replay occurs (and you send 2 cards from your opponent's Deck to the Graveyard).
*   If "DNA Surgery" is in play changing all monsters to Zombie-Types, and a monster that was not originally a Zombie-Type is Special Summoned, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect is applied and you send 2 cards from your opponent's Deck to the Graveyard.
*   If a Zombie-Type monster is Special Summoned on your opponent's side of the field, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect activates.
*   If a Zombie-Type monster is Special Summoned face-down (with "The Shallow Grave", etc.) then "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect does not activate.
*   If multiple Zombie-Type monsters are Special Summoned simultaneously, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect is only applied once (so send just 2 cards).
*   If "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" is Special Summoned by itself, its effect is not applied for its own Special Summon.
*   If "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" and several other Zombie-Type monsters are Special Summoned simultaneously (with "Cyber Jar"), that Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower's effect is not applied.
*   If you have "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" in play and "The Kick Man" is Special Summoned, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect is Step 1 of a chain and "The Kick Man"'s effect is Step 2.
*   If you have "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" and "Card of Safe Return", and a Zombie-Type monster is Special Summoned, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" is Step 1 of the chain and "Card of Safe Return" is Step 2.
*   You can chain to "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect that sends 2 cards to the Graveyard.
