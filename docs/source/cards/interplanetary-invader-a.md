> ① Gain control of a monster that attacks this face-up Attack Position card, at the end of the Battle Phase.

*   The ① Trigger Effect meets activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step, then "starts another chain" in the End of the Battle Phase, this time taking control of every monster that battled it.
    *   This effect does not target.
    *   This effect activates even if Invader 'A' is destroyed in battle / removed from play.
    *   Take control of that monster(s), even if it is flipped face-down before the end of the Battle Phase.
    *   If Invader 'A' is attacked by multiple monsters, you take control of every monster that attacked it.
    *   If you have no open Monster Card Zones at the End of the Battle Phase, destroy affected monsters.
    *   You retain control of those monsters, even if Invader 'A' is flipped face-down / leaves the field.
*   The ① Effect will NOT ACTIVATE IF:
    *   Invader 'A' is returned to the Deck by "[Grave Protector](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Grave_Protector)".
    *   a Level 4 or higher monster attacks Invader 'A' and "Gravity Bind" is activated.
