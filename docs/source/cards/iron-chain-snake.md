# IRON CHAIN SNAKE

*   "Iron Chain Snake"'s first effect targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.
*   The player that controlled the equipped monster when it was destroyed sends cards from the top of their Deck to the Graveyard.
*   If "Iron Chain Snake" is equipped to a monster with another card's effect, the equipped monster does not lose ATK and DEF. However, when the equipped monster is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, the effect of "Iron Chain Snake" activates.
*   When the equipped monster is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, if its controller has fewer cards in their Deck than the Level of the destroyed monster, every card left in their Deck is sent to the Graveyard.
