# TERRORKING ARCHFIEND

*   When your only Archfiend monster is an Equip Spell Card equipped to "Relinquished", you cannot Normal Summon or Flip Summon "Terrorking Archfiend".
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, you still need to have an Archfiend Monster Card on your side of the field in order to Normal Summon or Flip Summon "Terrorking Archfiend".
*   You can Set or Special Summon a "Terrorking Archfiend" even if there are no Archfiend Monster Cards on your side of the field.
