# Spell Gear

*   "'Ancient Gear' cards" means any card you control that has "Ancient Gear" in its card name.
*   You cannot activate "Spell Gear" if you do not have any "Ancient Gear Golem" remaining in your Deck.
*   If an effect is chained that prevents you from Special Summoning "Ancient Gear Golem", you still cannot Normal Summon or Set until the end of your next turn.
*   The effect that prohibits Normal Summons or Sets until the end of your next turn is not a restriction on this cardâ€™s activation. So you can activate this card if you Normal Summoned earlier in the turn. But you cannot Normal Summon or Set after it is activated.
