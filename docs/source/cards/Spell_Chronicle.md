# SPELL CHRONICLE

*   Sending every card in your hand to the Graveyard is a cost to activate "Spell Chronicle". The 5 Spell or Trap Cards are removed from play when "Spell Chronicle" resolves.
*   "Spell Chronicle" cannot be activated when you have a combined total of 4 or less Spell and Trap Cards remaining in your Deck.
*   The Spell and Trap Cards are removed from play face-up.
*   Placing 1 Chronicle Counter onto "Spell Chronicle" does not start a Chain.
*   The damage inflicted by "Spell Chronicle" does not start a Chain.
*   Adding 1 of the removed from play Spell or Trap Cards to your hand does not target the card to be added to your hand.
*   When you activate "Spell Chronicle", it does not gain a Chronicle Counter if a Quick-Play Spell Card is chained to its activation.
