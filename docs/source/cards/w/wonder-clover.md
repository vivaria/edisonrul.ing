# Wonder Clover

*   Sending a Plant from your hand to the Graveyard is a cost to activate “Wonder Clover.”
*   “Wonder Clover” targets 1 monster you control.
*   Monsters that are unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards, like “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6,” can still attack even if “Wonder Clover” is preventing other monsters from attacking.
*   You cannot target a monster with “Wonder Clover” if it is already affected by a card like “Twin Swords of Flashing Light – Tryce.”
*   If “Imperial Order” is activated, you still cannot attack with other monsters.
