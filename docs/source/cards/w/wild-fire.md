*   You cannot activate "Wild Fire" if you are prevented from Special Summoning monsters, due to an effect like "Scapegoat".
*   If you activate "Wild Fire" the effect that you cannot declare an attack affects you, the player, so even a monster that is unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards like "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6" cannot attack.
*   You can activate "Royal Oppression" in a chain to "Wild Fire".
*   "Blaze Accelerator" is destroyed when "Wild Fire" resolves. If an effect is chained that removes "Blaze Accelerator" from the field, "Wild Fire"'s effect disappears and you can attack that turn.
