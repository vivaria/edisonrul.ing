*   “Winged Kuriboh LV10's” effect is a Quick Effect. You can't activate this effect during the Damage Step.
*   The Quick Effect of “Winged Kuriboh LV10”can be chained to. You can chain “Barrel Behind the Door” or “My Body as a Shield” to the effect.
*   Tributing “Winged Kuriboh LV10” is a cost to activate its effect.
*   The “combined original ATK” of the destroyed monsters is calculated after the monsters are destroyed and are no longer on the field. So a destroyed “King of the Skull Servants” would add 0 damage to this effect, and a destroyed “Fusilier Dragon – the Dual Mode Beast” that was Summoned without Tribute would add 2800 damage.
*   You can't activate “Level Up!” to send “Winged Kuriboh LV10” to the GY because it does not have a monster’s name in its text.
*   You may return “Winged Kuriboh LV10” from your GY to your Deck with the effect of “The GY in the Fourth Dimension”.
*   If an opponent’s monster can't be destroyed by the effect of “Winged Kuriboh LV10”, no damage is dealt for that monster’s ATK. For example, if “Master Monk” targeted by “Lone Wolf” is on the field, it is unaffected by monster effects, so it won't be destroyed and its 1900 original ATK points won't be inflicted to its controller.
*   You can activate the effect of “Winged Kuriboh LV10” if “Skill Drain” is on the field, and its effect will resolve normally and not be negated, because it is no longer a face-up monster on the field.
