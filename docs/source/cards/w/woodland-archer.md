### Card Rulings

● The only way you can Special Summon this card is via its own procedure.
Even if it was initially summoned that way, you still can't summon it with card effects.
● Only cards with yellow borders are "Normal Monsters". "Gaia Knight, the Force of Earth" and "Kamionwizard" are not normal monsters.
