### Card Rulings

*   You activate this card after damage calculation.
*   Revealing 1 Level 1 monster from your hand is a cost.
*   If a monster is reduced to Level 1 while it’s in your hand, you can reveal it for “Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing” and Special Summon monsters of the same name from your Deck.
*   If “Mystical Space Typhoon” is Chained to “Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing” and destroys that card that is changing the Level of your in-hand monster to 1, the effect to Special Summon will still resolve.
*   If you only have 1 Monster Card Zone open when this card resolves, you choose which of the two monsters to Special Summon, and the other one goes to your Graveyard.
*   If an effect is Chained that removes the card you revealed from your hand, the effect to Special Summon will not be resolved.
*   You cannot activate “Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing” if you don’t have a monster in your Deck of the same name as a Level 1 monster in your hand.
*   The card you reveal is revealed until “Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing” is completely resolved.
