# Wave-Motion Cannon

> ① During your Main Phase, you can send this card to the Graveyard to inflict 1000 damage to your opponent for each of your Standby Phases that have passed since this card was activated.

*   The ① Ignition-like Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Sending "Wave-Motion Cannon" to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   No Counters are involved in this card's effect. You simply count your own Standby Phase.
    *   This effect cannot be negated by "Magic Jammer", etc. Your opponent can chain "Magic Jammer" when you first activate "Wave-Motion Cannon" (when you place it face-up on the field).
    *   If "Imperial Order" is active, count Standby Phases as normal for "Wave-Motion Cannon".
    *   You can activate "Wave-Motion Cannon" (place it face-up on the field) and send it to the Graveyard during the same turn, but it will not do any damage.
    *   If "Solomon's Lawbook" skips yourStandby Phase, or the turn is skipped with "Gamble", increase the count for "Wave-Motion Cannon" anyway. "Pyro Clock of Destiny" will not increase the count.
