*   “Widespread Dud” targets the 2 face-up monsters. The effect to destroy the targeted monsters does not start a Chain.
*   If “Enemy Controller” is Chained to “Widespread Dud” and shifts one of the targeted monsters to face-up Defense Position, “Widespread Dud” will still resolve normally.
*   Even if one of the targeted monsters is changed to Defense Position after “Widespread Dud” resolves it will still be affected by “Widespread Dud.”
*   If “Book of Moon” is Chained to “Widespread Dud” and flips one of the targeted monsters face-down, only the other one will continue to be targeted.
*   After “Widespread Dud” resolves, when one of the targeted monsters is removed from the field “Widespread Dud” is destroyed and the other monster is destroyed.
