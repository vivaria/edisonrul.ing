# Overdoom Line

*   The ATK boost of “Overdoom Line” starts a Chain, but does not target.
*   The text on “Overdoom Line” that destroys itself is not an effect, so “Royal Decree” etc. will not stop it from being destroyed.
*   Plants that were Special Summoned before the activation of “Overdoom Line” do not receive an ATK boost when “Overdoom Line” is activated.
*   Monsters that get an ATK boost from “Overdoom Line” keep the boost even if they become a Type other than Plant-Type.
*   If a monster receives the ATK boost from “Overdoom Line” but is flipped face-down, it loses the boost, even if flipped face-up again while “Overdoom Line” is still on the field.
*   You cannot activate “Overdoom Line” during the Damage Step.
*   While “Imperial Custom” is active, “Overdoom Line” cannot destroy itself, so it will remain on the field. Its effect will also remain.
