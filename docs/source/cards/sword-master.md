# SWORD MASTER

*   This effect activates if your opponent’s monster is not destroyed during damage calculation.
*   The attacking monster must be Warrior-Type the entire time from attack declaration until the end of the Damage Step in order to Special Summon “Sword Master.”
*   If your opponent’s monster is destroyed by a card effect while your Warrior-Type monster is attacking, it is still not destroyed by battle, so you can Special Summon “Sword Master.”
