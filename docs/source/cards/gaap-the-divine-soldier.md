    *   Set monsters changed to Attack Position by this effect are not treated as being Flip Summoned.
        *   "Torrential Tribute" CANNOT be activated.
    *   Both Players can Set monsters, but they are immediately changed to face-up Attack Position.
    *   Cards / Effects that Special Summon face-down / Set monsters can be activated, but those monsters are immediately changed to face-up Attack Position.
*   The ② Ignition Effect can only be activated during the Main Phase.
    *   Revealing a Fiend-Type monster(s) from your hand is a cost.
    *   You can choose how many Fiend-Type monsters you reveal.
