# Reptilianne Medusa

*   Sending 1 card from your hand to the Graveyard is a cost.
*   This is an Ignition Effect that targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.
*   If an effect gives you control of the monster targeted by this effect, the monster's ATK will still become 0 and it will not be able to change its battle position.
*   If the targeted monster is flipped face-down, this effect is not applied.
*   You cannot target a monster with 0 ATK with this effect.
