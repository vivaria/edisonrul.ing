# DNA CHECKUP

*   This card targets 1 face-down monster you control.
*   If the targeted monster is not on the field when “DNA Checkup” resolves, its effect disappears.
*   You cannot target a face-down Spell Card Special Summoned by “Magical Hats”.
*   If the targeted monster has multiple Attributes, like “Light and Darkness Dragon” you only refer to the Attribute printed on the card when resolving “DNA Checkup”.
*   Your opponent declares 2 Attributes when the effect resolves, immediately before revealing the monster.
*   You cannot activate “DNA Checkup” if either player has less than 2 cards left in their Deck.
