# PULLING THE RUG  
> Negate the activation and effect of an Effect Monster whose effect activated when a monster was Normal Summoned (even itself), and destroy that Effect Monster.

*   This effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Zaborg the Thunder Monarch").
*   If a monster effect activates in response to a Normal Summon (ex: "King Tiger Wanghu"), you can activate this card.
*   This effect does not target.
*   When a Normal Summoned monster activates its effect (ex: “Caius the Shadow Monarch”) while “Light and Darkness Dragon” is face-up, the effect of the Summoned monster will be Chain Link 1 and “Light and Darkness Dragon” will be Chain Link 2. Therefore, “Pulling the Rug” cannot activate as it cannot negate the effect of the Special Summoned monster.
*   This card cannot be activated in response to an Ignition Effect activated in the Summon response timing via Ignition Effect Priority.
