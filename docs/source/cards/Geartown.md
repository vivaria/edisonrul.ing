# Geartown

> ① Both players can Tribute Summon "Ancient Gear" monsters with 1 less Tribute than required. ② When this card is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, you can Special Summon 1 "Ancient Gear" monster from your hand, Deck, or Graveyard.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies to both players.
    *   You can still Tribute the usual number of monsters to Summon an "Ancient Gear" monster.
    *   This effect does not apply to Tribute Setting an "Ancient Gear" monster. You cannot Set "Ancient Gear Beast" without a Tribute, but you can Normal Summon.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard, even if it leaves the Graveyard
    *   This effect does not target a monster in the Graveyard. It is not negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   This effect can activate if "Geartown" is destroyed in the hand and sent to the Graveyard.
    *   You can activate this effect if the activation (when played face-up) of "Geartown" (Chain Link 1) is negated and destroyed by "Solemn Judgment" / "Dark Bribe" (Chain Link 2).
    *   You can activate this effect if you Set a Field Spell over your (face-up/face-down) "Geartown" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=19974049&postcount=3)\].
    *   You can activate this effect if an opponent's Field Spell resolves, destroying your face-up "Geartown" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=19974049&postcount=3)\].
    *   This effect can activate if the last thing to happen when resolving an effect destroys "Geartown". If "[Ancient Fairy Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ancient_Fairy_Dragon)" destroys "Geartown" and gains 1000 Life Points, but does not add a Field Spell from Deck to hand, then "Geartown" effect can activate and does not miss the timing.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect CANNOT ACTIVATE:
    *   if "Geartown" is removed from play (by "Macro Cosmos") when destroyed.
    *   if "Geartown" was destroyed by its controller activating a new Field Spell Card \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=19974049&postcount=3)\].
    *   if "Geartown" was destroyed as Chain Link 2+.
    *   if "Geartown" was destroyed as the first part of an effect that resolves sequentially. If "[Ancient Fairy Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ancient_Fairy_Dragon)" destroys "Geartown" and gains 1000 Life Points, then also adds a Field Spell from Deck to hand, "Geartown" cannot activate its effect because it has missed the timing.
