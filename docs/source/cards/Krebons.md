# Krebons

> ① When this card is selected as an attack target, you can pay 800 Life Points to negate the attack.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates at the Start of the Battle Step - Attack Declaration.
    *   Paying 800 Life Points is a cost.
    *   This effect does not target.
    *   This effect resolves, even if "Krebons" is flipped face-down / leaves the field.
    *   If this effect negates the attack of a monster like "Asura Priest", it cannot attack "Krebons" again.
