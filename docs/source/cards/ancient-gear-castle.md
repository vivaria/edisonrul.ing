# ANCIENT GEAR CASTLE

> ① Face-up "Ancient Gear" monsters gain 300 ATK. ② Each time a monster(s) is Normal Summoned or Set, put 1 counter on this card. ③ If you Tribute Summon an "Ancient Gear" monster, you can substitute this card for a Tribute(s), if the number of counters is equal to or greater than the number of required Tribute(s).

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies to "Ancient Gear" monsters on BOTH sides of the field.
*   The ② Continuous-like Effect does not start a Chain.
    *   “Set” means to Set from the hand.
    *   This card gains counters when a monster is Normal Summoned or Set (from the hand), even if a card effect performs the action (such as "Ultimate Offering").
    *   This card does not gain counters when a monster is Set by a card effect (by “Book of Moon”).
    *   This card does not gain counters when a monster is Special Summoned face-down (by “The Shallow Grave”).
*   The ③ Continuous-like Effect does not start a Chain.
    *   While "Geartown" is active, you can Tribute "Ancient Gear Castle" with 1 Counter to Tribute Summon "Ancient Gear Golem".
    *   This is not an extra Normal Summon, it only substitutes the monster(s) to be Tributed.
    *   This effect does not apply for a Tribute Set.
