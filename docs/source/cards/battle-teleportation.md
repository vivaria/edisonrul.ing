# Battle Teleportation

*   This effect targets your face-up Psychic-Type monster.
*   You can activate “Battle Teleportation” even if your opponent has no open Monster Card Zones. If you do, the Psychic-Type monster is unable to move to your opponent’s side of the field and is destroyed.
*   You cannot activate “Battle Teleportation” if you cannot enter your Battle Phase.
*   You can activate “Battle Teleportation” if your opponent has “Swords of Revealing Light” face-up on the field because “Swords of Revealing Light” only prevents you from declaring an attack.
*   This card can target a monster that has already attacked.
*   You can activate “Battle Teleportation” any time between your Draw Phase and the end of the Battle Phase.
