# Kotodama

*   Sheep Tokens will be destroyed by the effect of "Kotodama" since Monster Tokens are considered cards.
*   If two Flip Effect monsters are flipped face-up at the same time while "Kotodama" is on the field, their effects are negated and they are destroyed.
*   If 2 or more monsters with identical names are on the field when "Kotodama" is Summoned, they are all destroyed.
