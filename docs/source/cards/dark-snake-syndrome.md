# DARK SNAKE SYNDROME

*   If you have multiple copies of "Dark Snake Syndrome", the effects are cumulative.
*   Both players take damage during the Standby Phase of the controller of the "Dark Snake Syndrome".
*   If "Imperial Order" is active, you still increase the damage from turn to turn for "Dark Snake Syndrome" even though no damage is dealt.
