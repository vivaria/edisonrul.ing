# DRAGON CAPTURE JAR

*   Dragon-Type monsters on both sides of the field are affected by "Dragon Capture Jar".
*   If "Stop Defense" is activated targeting a Dragon-Type monster, it is switched to Attack Position, but then is immediately changed back to Defense Position since the effect of "Dragon Capture Jar" is continuous.
