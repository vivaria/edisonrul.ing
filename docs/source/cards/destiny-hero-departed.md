# DESTINY HERO - DEPARTED

*   When "Destiny Hero - Departed" is sent to the Graveyard to pay a cost, it is not removed from play.
*   "Destiny Hero - Departed"'s first effect is a Trigger Effect. It is not optional.
*   "Destiny Hero - Departed"'s effect is not activated while "King Tiger Wanghu" is face-up on the field because an infinite loop would result. If "Destiny Hero - Departed"'s ATK would become greater than 1400 when Special Summoned, because of another card's effect, it is Special Summoned.
