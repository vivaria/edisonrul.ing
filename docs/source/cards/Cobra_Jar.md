# COBRA JAR

*   When the "Poisonous Snake Token" is destroyed as a result of battle, it is the opponent of "Cobra Jar"'s controller that takes the damage; so even if the opponent had taken control of the "Poisonous Snake Token" with "Change of Heart", he/she still takes the damage when it is destroyed.
