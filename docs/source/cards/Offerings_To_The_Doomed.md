# OFFERINGS TO THE DOOMED

*   Skipping your next Draw Phase is not a cost, so if your opponent chains "Magic Jammer" or "Imperial Order" to negate this card, you do NOT skip your next Draw Phase.
*   If your opponent chains "Book of Moon" to flip the target of this card face-down, the monster is not destroyed and you will skip your next Draw Phase.
