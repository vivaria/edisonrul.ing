# Hand Destruction

> Each player sends 2 cards from their hand to the Graveyard and draws 2 cards.

*   Sending 2 cards from the hand to the Graveyard is NOT a cost.
    *   Sending a card to the Graveyard is not the same as discarding it.
    *   Dragon-Type monsters sent to the Graveyard do not count towards "Super Rejuvenation".
    *   "Dark World" monsters will not activate, since they must be discarded to the Graveyard.
    *   If a player is unable to draw 2 cards (because they have 1 or 0 in Deck), they lose the duel.
    *   if a player does not have 2 cards in hand to send to the Graveyard, then neither player sends any cards from the hand to the Graveyard nor draws cards.
*   This card CAN be activated while "Macro Cosmos" is active. The cards are removed from play instead.
*   You CANNOT ACTIVATE "Hand Destruction":
    *   if either player has fewer than 2 cards remaining in their Deck.
    *   while "Protector of the Sanctuary" is face-up on the field.
    *   if activating (playing it face-up) it would cause you to have fewer than 2 cards in your hand.
