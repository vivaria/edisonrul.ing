# SPIRIT OF THE POT OF GREED

*   "Spirit of the Pot of Greed"'s effect does not chain to "Pot of Greed"; instead, you activate it after "Pot of Greed" resolves.
*   "Spirit of the Pot of Greed" must be face-up on the field to resolve its effect; if "Book of Moon" is chained to "Pot of Greed" or to the effect of "Spirit of the Pot of Greed", "Spirit of the Pot of Greed"'s effect is negated.
*   If "Imperial Order" negates the effect of "Pot of Greed", "Spirit of the Pot of Greed"'s effect still activates because "Pot of Greed"'s activation was not negated.
