# JINZO - RETURNER

> ① This card can attack your opponent directly. ② When this card is sent to the Graveyard, you can Special Summon 1 "Jinzo" from your Graveyard. Destroy it during your End Phase.

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   If this effect is negated in the Damage Step, no replay occurs.
    *   If this effect is negated when the attack is declared, a replay occurs since this card cannot attack directly.
*   The ② optional "When... you can..."Trigger Effect can miss the timing.
    *   If the Special Summoned "Jinzo" is flipped face-down, it is not destroyed in the End Phase.
    *   If "Future Fusion" sends (multiple) "Jinzo" and (multiple) "Jinzo - Returner" to the Graveyard at the same time, you can activate the effect of (all) "Jinzo – Returner" in a new Chain.
    *   Destroying "Jinzo" in the End Phase does not start a Chain.
    *   This effect will not activate if Returner is sent to the Graveyard as Chain Link 2+.
    *   This effect will not activate if Returner is sent to the Graveyard before the last thing to happen.
