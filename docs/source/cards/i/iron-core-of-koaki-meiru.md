# Iron Core Of Koa’Ki Meiru

*   Both effects of “Iron Core of Koa’ki Meiru” start a chain.
*   Sending a “Koa’ki Meiru” monster to the Graveyard is a cost to activate the second effect.
*   While “Macro Cosmos” is active, you cannot send “Iron Core of Koa’ki Meiru” to the Graveyard to pay the cost of keeping your “Koa’ki Meiru” monster on the field. So you must either pay the reveal cost, or destroy the monster.
