### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① When you draw this card while you have no cards in your hand: You can reveal this card; Special Summon this card from your hand.
> ② When this card is Special Summoned: You can add 1 "Infernity" card from your deck to your hand.
> You must have no cards in your hand to activate and resolve this effect.

### Card Rulings

About the ① effect:
● Revealing this card is a cost to activate it. If this card is already being revealed by another card effect (e.g. "Respect Play" or "Ceremonial Bell"), you cannot activate this effect.
● It can miss the timing. If you draw this card by a card effect that does something sequentially after drawing (e.g. "Upstart Goblin", "Allure of Darkness") or if you draw it by card effect at Chain Link 2 or higher, you cannot activate this effect.
● If you draw multiple cards including "Infernity Archfiend" while you have no cards in hand (e.g. with "Pot of Avarice", "Card Destruction", "Hand Destruction"), you can activate this effect. But the ② effect cannot be activated if you still have a card(s) in your hand.
● If you draw multiple copies of this card while you have no cards in your hand, you can activate both of the ① effects in chain.
(This contradicts the rulings of "Gorz the Emissary of Darkness", "Tragoedia" etc and would come to change in July 2012).
● If the activation of your Chain Link 1 Spell/Trap was negated by your opponent's "Dark Bribe" and you draw this card while you have no cards in your hand, you can activate this effect.
● You can activate this effect in the Damage Step.

About the ② effect:
● It can miss the timing. If you Special Summon this card by a card effect that does something sequentially after the summon (e.g. "ZERO-MAX") or if you Special Summon it by card effect at Chain Link 2 or higher, you cannot activate this effect.
● If you activate this effect but have a card(s) in your hand when attempting to resolve it, it will resolve without effect.
● You can activate this effect in the Damage Step.
