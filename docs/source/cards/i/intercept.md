### Card Rulings

*   Intercept targets the Tribute Summoned monster.
*   If the Tribute Summoned monster has an effect that activates when it is Tribute Summoned, the player that Tribute Summoned the monster activates its effect. Intercept is chained to the monster's effect.
*   Intercept can't be activated when Jinzo is Tribute Summoned, because Jinzo's effect is already applied and prevents Trap Cards from being activated.
