# Inherited Fortune

*   You cannot activate this card during the Damage Step.
*   You can activate “Inherited Fortune” even if you cannot Special Summon at the time, such as if you activated “Scapegoat” this turn or “Archlord Kristya” is on the field.
*   You cannot Chain “Royal Oppression” to “Inherited Fortune.” The effect to Special Summon monsters starts a Chain during y our Standby Phase. You can Chain “Royal Oppression” to the effect to Special Summon monsters.
*   If “Royal Decree” is activated in a Chain to the effect to Special Summon monsters, the effect will still Special Summon the monsters because it is not an effect that activates on the field.
*   You can activate “Inherited Fortune” even if you have no “Fortune Lady” monsters in your hand.
