    *   If a card is chained to this effect and destroys “Il Blud”, the effect to Special Summon is still resolved. The Special Summoned monster will not be destroyed by “Il Blud’s” effect.
    *   If there is no monster in either Graveyard or in your hand that can be Special Summoned by this effect when it resolves, your opponent can look at your hand to verify.
