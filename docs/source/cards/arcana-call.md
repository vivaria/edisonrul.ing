# ARCANA CALL

> Select 1 "Arcana Force" monster you control. Remove from play 1 "Arcana Force" monster from either player's Graveyard. Until the End Phase, the selected monster's effect becomes the removed monster's effect for the same coin toss result.

*   "Arcana Call" targets 1 "Arcana Force" monster you control and 1 "Arcana Force" monster in the Graveyard.
*   If an effect is chained that removes the "Arcana Force" monster from the Graveyard, the effect of "Arcana Call" disappears.
*   The heads/tails effect of the "Arcana Force" monster you control is replaced by the effect of the removed from play "Arcana Force" monster. It does not have both effects simultaneously. The monsterâ€™s original heads/tails effect is reapplied when "Arcana Call"'s effect disappears in the End Phase.
