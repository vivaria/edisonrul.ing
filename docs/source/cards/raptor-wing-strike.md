# RAPTOR WING STRIKE

*   Sending 1 “Blacking” monster to the Deck is a cost.
*   You cannot activate “Raptor Wing Strike” if you have no “Blackwing” monsters in your Deck.
*   If you use a “Blackwing” Synchro Monster to pay the cost of “Raptor Wing Strike”, that Synchro Monster is returned to the Extra Deck.
