# Coffin Seller

*   "Coffin Seller" applies its effect when monster(s) are sent from the hand, Deck, or the field to the Graveyard.
*   If multiple monsters are sent to the Graveyard at the same time (due to "Dark Hole", etc.) then inflict 300 damage only because it is considered as 1 time.
*   Multiple copies of "Coffin Seller" are cumulative.
