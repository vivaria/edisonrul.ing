# ROPE OF LIFE

*   Discarding your hand is a cost and the cost must be at least 1 card. So if you have zero cards in your hand, you cannot activate "Rope of Life".
*   If your monster is controlled by your opponent and sent to your Graveyard, you can activate "Rope of Life". You cannot activate "Rope of Life" when your opponentâ€™s monster you control is sent to his/her Graveyard.
*   The increase in ATK is permanent as long as the monster remains face-up on the field.
*   You can use "Rope of Life" to Special Summon "Jinzo" and "Jinzo"'s ATK will increase by 800 points.
