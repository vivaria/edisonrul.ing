# RED-EYES ZOMBIE DRAGON

*   "Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon"'s first effect is a Continuous Effect. Its second effect is an optional Trigger Effect.
*   The monster destroyed in battle by "Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon" must be a Zombie-Type monster both on the field and in the Graveyard. If "DNA Surgery" is active, with "Zombie-Type" chosen, and a Non-Zombie-Type monster is destroyed in battle by "Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon", "Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon"'s effect does not activate because the monster reverts to a Non-Zombie-Type monster in the Graveyard.
*   When your "Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon" attacks and destroys your opponent's "Pyramid Turtle" in battle, if both effects are activated, "Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon"'s effect is Chain Link 1 and "Pyramid Turtle"'s effect is Chain Link 2.
