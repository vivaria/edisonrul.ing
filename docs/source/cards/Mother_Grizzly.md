# MOTHER GRIZZLY

*   If you attack with your "Mother Grizzly" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you may attack with the monster Special Summoned by "Mother Grizzly" before entering Main Phase 2.
*   If your opponent controls your "Mother Grizzly" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you get the effect of "Mother Grizzly" NOT your opponent.
*   Since the Special Summoning occurs during the Damage Step, "Torrential Tribute", etc. cannot be used.
