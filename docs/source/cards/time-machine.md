# TIME MACHINE

*   "Time Machine" is activated at the end of the Damage Step, when monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the Graveyard.
*   "Time Machine"'s effect does not target.
*   If a face-down Defense Position monster is attacked and is destroyed by battle, when it is Special Summoned by "Time Machine" it is Special Summoned in face-up Defense Position.
*   If a monster is Special Summoned onto your side of the field with "Time Machine" during your Battle Phase, it may attack again during that Battle Phase.
*   If you activate "Time Machine" when your monster that is being controlled by your opponent is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, when "Time Machine" resolves your monster is Special Summoned onto your opponent's side of the field. If your opponent had taken control of the monster with "Brain Control", etc., it will remain under your opponent's control and will not return to your side of the field in the End Phase.
*   If you destroy your opponent's monster by battle, when it is sent to the Graveyard you can activate "Time Machine". If you do, the monster is Special Summoned onto your opponent's side of the field.
*   If a monster that cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, "Time Machine" cannot be activated.
*   Any Equip Cards that were equipped to the monster when it was destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard are not requipped to the monster when it is Special Summoned.
*   If a Toon Monster like "Toon Mermaid", "Toon Summoned Skull", "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon", or "Manga Ryu-Ran" is destroyed by battle and set to the Graveyard while "Toon World" is not face-up on the field, "Time Machine" cannot be activated.
*   If a monster with an effect that activates when it is destroyed by battle is sent to the Graveyard, like "Sangan" or "Giant Rat", you can chain "Time Machine".
*   If two monsters with equal ATK are both destroyed by the same battle, "Time Machine" cannot be activated.
*   If "Jinzo" is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, you can activate "Time Machine" to Special Summon "Jinzo".
*   If "Embodiment of Apophis" is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, "Time Machine" cannot be activated because "Embodiment of Apophis" is not a monster while in the Graveyard.
*   Cards like "Torrential Tribute" cannot be activated when a monster is Special Summoned by "Time Machine", because cards like "Torrential Tribute" cannot be activated in the Damage Step.
*   When your "Makyura the Destructor" is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, you can activate "Time Machine" from your hand.
*   If a Fusion Monster that was Special Summoned from the Extra Deck by "Metamorphosis" is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, "Time Machine" cannot be activated because the Fusion Monster was not properly Special Summoned and cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard.
*   If your "Sealmaster Meisei" is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard while you control "Talisman of Trap Sealing", you can activate "Time Machine" because "Talisman of Trap Sealing" is destroyed when "Sealmaster Mesei" is removed from the field.
