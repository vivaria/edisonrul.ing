# IMPERIAL CUSTOM  
> ① Face-up Continuous Trap Cards cannot be destroyed, except "Imperial Custom". You can only control 1 "Imperial Custom".

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect does not activate.
*   This effect only protects Continuous Traps from destruction.
    *   Continuous Traps which destroy themselves (ex: "Call of the Haunted") are not destroyed.
    *   Continuous Traps still destroy themselves if maintenance costs are not paid (ex: "Mirror Wall").
    *   Trap Monsters (ex: "Zoma the Spirit") can't be destroyed by battle or card effect.
    *   If "Heavy Storm" would destroy face-up Continous Trap Cards, "Imperial Custom" is destroyed but all other face-up Continuous Trap Cards (including your opponent's) remain.
*   Continuous Trap Cards can still:
    *   be flipped face-down (a Trap Monster targeted by "Book of Moon").
    *   be returned to the Deck (by "Raiza the Storm Monarch").
    *   be returned to the hand (by "Giant Trunade").
    *   be removed from play (by "Caius the Shadow Monarch").
    *   have their effects negated (by "Jinzo").
    *   have their activation (playing face-up) negated (by "Dark Bribe"). If the activation of a Continuous Trap Card is negated, it is sent to the Graveyard. It was never face-up on the field.
