# EBON MAGICIAN CURRAN

*   The effect of “Ebon Magician Curran” is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to.
*   Count the number of monsters on the opponent’s side of the field when you resolve the effect of “Ebon Magician Curran”, not when it activates.
*   If “Ebon Magician Curran” is Special Summoned during the Standby Phase while “King Tiger Wanghu” is on the field, both Trigger Effects activate immediately and form a chain.
