# MORPHTRONIC CAMERAN

*   While "Skill Drain" is active, the Attack Position and Defense Position effects of "Morphtronic Cameran" cannot be activated, because the "While in Attack Position" and "While in Defense Position" effects are negated. If "Morphtronic Cameran" is destroyed by battle while in Attack Position, its effect will not activate because it was destroyed by battle while its "While in Attack Position" effect was being negated.
