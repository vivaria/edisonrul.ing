# Fairy Box

*   If you have two copies of "Fairy Box" active on the field you may flip a coin twice, but only need to call 1 correctly to reduce the attacking monster’s ATK to 0.
*   The current ATK is reduced to 0, including all Equip Spell Cards. Trap Cards and Quick-Play Spell Cards cannot further increase the monster’s ATK this battle. A monster effect such as "Injection Fairy Lily" can increase its own ATK after "Fairy Box" is successful.
*   Paying 500 Life Points is optional, if you choose not to pay "Fairy Box" is destroyed.
*   The effect of "Fairy Box" does not target, so "Lord of D." will not prevent "Fairy Box" from reducing the ATK of an attacking Dragon-Type monster to 0.
