# READY FOR INTERCEPTING

*   If you activate "Ready for Intercepting" after your opponentâ€™s attack declaration to flip face-down the monster which is being attacked, a replay does not occur. Complete the attack as normal. (This must happen during the Battle Step, not the Damage Step.)
*   If you activate "Ready for Intercepting" and target the attacking monster, it is flipped into face-down Defense Position and the attack ends. (This must happen during the Battle Step, not the Damage Step.)
*   While the effect of "Light of Intervention" is active, you cannot activate "Ready for Intercepting".
*   If you chain "Ready for Intercepting" to "Hammer Shot" to flip a monster face-down, that monster will not be included in determining which monster is destroyed by the effect of "Hammer Shot".
