# SYSTEM DOWN  
> Pay 1000 Life Points. ① Remove from play all Machine-Type monsters on your opponent's side of the field and in their Graveyard.

*   Paying 1000 Life Points is a cost.
*   The ① effect does not destroy Machine-Type monsters, it only removes them from play.
    *   This does not affect face-down Machines.
    *   This does not affect Machine-Types treated as Equip Spell Cards (such as Union Monsters).
    *   If your opponent controls “Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer”, Machines in the Graveyard are not removed from play, but Machines on the field can still be removed from play by its effect.
