# MAGIC PLANTER

*   You can send a Trap Monster like “Embodiment of Apophis” to the Graveyard to pay the cost for “Magic Planter.”
*   You cannot send “Macro Cosmos” to the Graveyard to pay the cost of “Magic Planter,” since “Macro Cosmos” is preventing you from sending cards to the Graveyard as costs.
