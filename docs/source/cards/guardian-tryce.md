# GUARDIAN TRYCE

*   If you Special Summon "Guardian Tryce", you don't get to activate his effect when he's destroyed, even if you Tribute Summoned him previously and are using "Monster Reborn" on him later.
*   You must Special Summon the exact same card that was Tributed for "Guardian Tryce" when using his effect; you cannot Special Summon a card of the same name.
*   You cannot use "Guardian Tryce"'s effect to Special Summon a "Special Summon-only" monster that had not been properly Summoned, such as a Fusion Monster that was Special Summoned with "Magical Scientist" and then Tributed for "Guardian Tryce".
*   You cannot Special Summon "Dark Ruler Ha Des" with "Guardian Tryce"'s effect.
*   You can Special Summon a monster in your opponent's Graveyard if it was used to Tribute Summon "Guardian Tryce".
*   If "Guardian Tryce" is an Equip Spell Card equipped to "Relinquished" or "Sword Hunter", and "Guardian Tryce" is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, his effect activates.
*   If "Guardian Tryce" is Set and is destroyed, his effect activates.
