# Armoroid

> ① When you Tribute Summon this card by Tributing at least 1 "roid" monster, remove from play all Spell and Trap Cards on the field.

*   The ① Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Trap Hole").
    *   Tributing a face-down “roid” monster will count toward activating the effect of “Armoroid”.
    *   This effect banishes ALL Spell / Trap Cards on the field. They are banished face-up.
