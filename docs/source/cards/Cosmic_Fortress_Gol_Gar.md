# COSMIC FORTRESS GOL’GAR  
> ① Once per turn, you can select any number of face-up Spell or Trap Cards. Return those cards to their owners' hands, and distribute new A-Counters among monsters on the field equal to the number of cards returned. ② Once per turn, you can remove 2 A-Counters from anywhere on the field to destroy 1 card your opponent controls.

*   The ① Ignition Effect targets a number of face-up Spell / Trap Cards on the field.
    *   The targeted cards are returned to the hand when the effect resolves. This is not a cost.
    *   If a chained effect destroys a Spell/Trap Card targeted by “Cosmic Fortress Gol’gar” before it is returned to the hand, no A-Counter is distributed for that particular Spell/Trap Card.
    *   The number of A-Counters distributed is based on the number of Spell/Trap Cards actually returned to the hand.
*   The ② Ignition Effect targets 1 card your opponent controls.
    *   Removing 2 A-Counters (from anywhere on the field) is a cost.
