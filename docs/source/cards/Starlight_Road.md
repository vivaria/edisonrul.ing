# STARLIGHT ROAD  
> Activate only when an effect is activated that would destroy 2 or more cards you control. Negate the effect and destroy that card. Then, you can Special Summon 1 “Stardust Dragon” from your Extra Deck.

*   This card can be activated when an effect would destroy 2(+) cards on the field simultaneously, even if some cards would be unaffected (ex: "Elemental Hero Wildheart" is unaffected by "Torrential Tribute").
    *   This card cannot be activated if an effect would only destroy 1 card you control (ex: "Celestia, Lightsworn Angel" / "Gladiator Beast Gyzarus" only targets 1 card with its effect).
    *   This card cannot be activated if an effect is not guaranteed to destroy 2(+) cards (ex: "Timewizard").
*   This card only negates card effects, it does not negate the activation of effects.
    *   This card cannot activate in the Damage Step.
*   This effect resolves sequentially. First, negate the effect and destroy that card, then (if "Starlight Road" destroyed that card) you can Special Summon 1 "Stardust Dragon" from your Extra Deck. Resolve the rest of the chain afterwards.
    *   VS. "Torrential Tribute": since "Starlight Road" does not negate the activation of the card / effect, "Torrential Tribute" can never be activated after the Chain because the Special Summon of "Stardust Dragon" was not the last thing to happen, the card / effect negated by "Starlight Road" resolved negated later in the Chain.
*   If this card negates the effect but does not destroy that card, you cannot Summon "Stardust Dragon".
    *   Example: Player A activates "Heavy Storm" and chains "Starlight Road" (Chain Link 2), Player B activates "Mystical Space Typhoon" (Chain Link 3) targeting "Heavy Storm". "Mystical Space Typhoon" destroys "Heavy Storm", "Starlight Road" negates the effect of "Heavy Storm" but didn't destroy it (Player A can't Summon "Stardust Dragon"), and "Heavy Storm" resolves negated.
    *   Example: Player A Synchro Summon "Black Rose Dragon" and activates its effect to destroy all cards on the field. Player B activates "Starlight Road". Resolving the chain: "Starlight Road" negates the effect of "Black Rose Dragon" and destroys it, Player B chooses to Special Summon 1 "Stardust Dragon", finally then the effect of "Black Rose Dragon" resolves negated. Player A cannot activate "Torrential Tribute" at this time, because "Stardust Dragon" was Summoned as Chain Link 2(+).
