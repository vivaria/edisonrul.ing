# BOOK OF MOON

> Flip 1 face-up monster on the field into face-down Defense Position.

*   This effect targets 1 face-up monster.
*   A monster flipped face-down remembers:
    *   if its Battle Position was changed this turn.
    *   that it declared an attack this turn.
    *   that it was Normal / Flip / Tribute / Ritual / Fusion / Synchro / Special Summoned.
    *   on what turn it was Summoned.
    *   which Synchro / Fusion / Ritual Material Monsters were used for its Summon.
*   A monster flipped face-down forgets:
    *   the properties of cards used for its Summon (name, Attribute, Type, etc.).
    *   what method / effect Summoned it (ex: "Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord").
    *   where it was Summoned from.
    *   lingering effects that previously applies to it (like "Limited Removal").
    *   if it used its "once per turn" effect(s) earlier this turn (read about exceptions [HERE](https://www.edisonformat.com/home/basic-strategy-flip-flop-fundamentals)).
    *   if it was Normal Summoned again (in the case of Gemini Monsters).
    *   if it had been Flip Summoned.
*   You cannot flip a Monster Token face-down because Monster Tokens are always face-up.
*   You cannot activate "Book of Moon" while "Light of Intervention" is active.
*   This card cannot be activated during the Damage Step.
