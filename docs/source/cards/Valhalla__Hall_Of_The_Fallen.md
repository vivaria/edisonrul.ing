# VALHALLA, HALL OF THE FALLEN

*   This effect starts a Chain Link. (It does not [target](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Target). This effect cannot be activated in the same Chain Link in which this card was activated. This effect can be activated after this card resolves.)

*   This effect can Special Summon Level 5 or higher Fairy-Type Normal Summon Monsters.
*   This effect cannot be activated if you cannot Special Summon any monster from your hand. (You can perform the activation of this card.)
*   "Royal Oppression" cannot be chained to "Call of the Mummy" or "Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen" when it is activated from the hand.
