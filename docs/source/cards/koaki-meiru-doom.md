# KOA’KI MEIRU DOOM

*   The first sentence of this card is a maintenance cost, not an effect. It does not start a Chain.
*   Continuous Effects that do not start a Chain cannot be negated by “Koa’ki Meiru Doom” because they do not ‘activate’.
*   “Koa’ki Meiru Doom” will negate effects that activate outside of the field (such as the Graveyard or Removed Zone), as long as it is during the Main Phase.
*   The effect of “Koa’ki Meiru Doom” is a Continuous Effect.
