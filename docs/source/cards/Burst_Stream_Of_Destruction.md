# BURST STREAM OF DESTRUCTION

*   If you activate "Burst Stream of Destruction", and the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" is removed from the field with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" or "Compulsory Evacuation Device", or flipped face-down with "Book of Moon", or destroyed by "Ring of Destruction", "Burst Stream of Destruction"'s effect still resolves.
*   You can activate "Burst Stream of Destruction" when you cannot have a Battle Phase because of "Frozen Soul", "D. D. Border Line", "Soul Exchange", or "Great Long Nose".
*   It is an effect of "Burst Stream of Destruction" that "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" cannot attack, so if "Non-Spellcasting Area" is on the field, "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" CAN attack. If "Imperial Order" is activated later, "Burst Stream of Destruction"'s effect is negated and "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" CAN attack.
*   If "Burst Stream of Destruction"'s activation is negated by "Magic Jammer", then "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" can attack.
*   NO copies of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" can attack the turn that "Burst Stream of Destruction"'s effect is applied, even if they are Summoned after "Burst Stream of Destruction" is played.
