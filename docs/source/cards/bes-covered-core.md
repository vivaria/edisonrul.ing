> ① When this card is Normal Summoned, put 2 counters on it. ② This card cannot be destroyed by battle. ③ If this card attacks or is attacked, at the end of the Damage Step toss a coin and call it. If you call it wrong, remove 1 counter. ④ If this card battles without a counter, destroy it at the end of the Damage Step.

*   The ① Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   If this card's effects are negated, the counters placed by this effect are removed.
*   The ② Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
*   The ③ Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
*   The ④ Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step if this card had no counter on it at the start of the Damage Step.
    *   If “B.E.S. Covered Core” battles a monster, and afterwards you lose the coin toss (for the ③ effect), so that “B.E.S. Covered Core” now has no counters, it is not destroyed. Because it still had a counter during damage calculation.
