# KINKA-BYO

*   "Kinka-Byo"'s effect targets 1 Level 1 monster in your Graveyard and continues to target it while it is on the field.
*   Removing the Special Summoned monster from play when "Kinka-Byo" is removed from the field does not start a Chain.
*   When "Kinka-Byo" is flipped face-down its effect disappears. If it is flipped face-up and Special Summons another Level 1 monster, when it is removed from the field only the newly Special Summoned Level 1 monster is removed from play. The previously Special Summoned Level 1 monster remains on the field.
*   If you Special Summon "Arcana Force 0 - The Fool" with "Kinka-Byo"'s effect and the coin toss for "Arcana Force 0 - The Fool" is heads, "Kinka-Byo"'s effect is negated and it is destroyed. "Arcana Force 0 - The Fool" remains on the field.
