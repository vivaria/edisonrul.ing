# Spirit Monsters

The following rules apply to all Spirit Monsters:

*   Spirit is not a monster Type; you cannot declare "Spirit" for the effect of "DNA Surgery".
*   Spirit Monsters are still Effect Monsters.
*   A Spirit Monster must be face-up on the field during the End Phase for it to return to the owner’s hand. If it was destroyed or removed from play, it will not return to the owner’s hand.
*   A Spirit Monster will return to the owner’s hand during the End Phase, even if the opponent played it from their hand (through the effect of "Exchange".)
