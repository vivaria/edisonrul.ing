# GUARDIAN KAY'EST

*   "Guardian Kay'est" is not affected by Spell Cards, just like "The Legendary Fisherman".
*   Your opponent cannot select "Guardian Kay'est" as the target of an attack.
*   If "Guardian Kay'est" is your only monster on the field, your opponent can attack your Life Points directly.
*   As long as "Guardian Kay'est" cannot be selected as the target of an attack, it cannot be targeted by the effect of "Staunch Defender", either.
*   If "Guardian Kay'est" and another monster are targeted for "Different Dimension Gate", only the other monster is removed from play and returns when "Different Dimension Gate" is destroyed.
*   If "Guardian Kay'est" and another monster are selected for "Creature Swap"'s effect, "Creature Swap"'s effect is negated because switching is impossible.
