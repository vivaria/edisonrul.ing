# MINEFIELD ERUPTION

*   If you activate “Minefield Eruption”, you inflict damage, then send your “Mine Golem”(s) to the Graveyard. So your opponent has missed the timing and cannot activate “Numinous Healer”, etc.
*   The number of “Mine Golem” cards is considered when “Minefield Eruption” resolves, not when it is activated.
