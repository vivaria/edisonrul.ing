# LEVEL WARRIOR

> Ⓢ If there are no monsters on the field, you can Normal Summon this card from your hand as a Level 2 monster. Ⓤ If your opponent controls a monster and you control no monsters, you can Special Summon this card from your hand as a Level 4 monster.

*   The Ⓤ Unclassified summon effect does not start a Chain.
*   “Skill Drain” has no effect on “Level Warrior’s” Level, because “Level Warrior” is considered to already be on the field with the appropriate level. So “Skill Drain” will not cause “Level Warrior’s” Level to become 3.
*   Even if “Level Warrior” becomes Level 5 or 6 due to “Level Conversion Lab,” you can still Summon it as a Level 2 or 4 monster with its effect.
