*   Note that "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8" has the word "except" in its Summoning conditions, which means that even if Special Summoned properly, you cannot revive it with "Monster Reborn" afterwards if it is destroyed.
*   The "you" in "on your side of the field" is the current controllerâ€™s field, so as long as "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 8" is face-up, it is always "face-up on your side of the field".
*   The ability of "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8" to negate Spell Cards is a Quick Effect that must be chained to the activation of the Spell Card.
