# DISCORD

*   Sending this card to the Graveyard during your 3rd End Phase after activation does not start a Chain.
*   You can activate the effect of “Blackwing – Vayu the Emblem of Honor” while “Discord” is active to Special Summon a Synchro Monster because it is not a Synchro Summon.
*   You cannot activate “Urgent Tuning” while “Discord” is active because it lets you perform a Synchro Summon.
*   If “Discord” is Chained to the activation of “Urgent Tuning” the effect of “Urgent Tuning” is not applied and no monsters are sent to the Graveyard.
