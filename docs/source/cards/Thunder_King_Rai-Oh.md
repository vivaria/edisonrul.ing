# THUNDER KING RAI-OH  
> ① Neither player can add cards from their Deck to their hand except by drawing them. ② You can send this face-up card to the Graveyard to negate the Special Summon of 1 of your opponent monsters, and destroy it.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   Cards / Effects that add a card(s) from Deck to hand (ex: "Terraforming", "Elemental Hero Stratos") cannot activate. Mandatory effects (like "Sangan" still activate, starting a chain).
    *   Cards can still be send from the Deck to the Graveyard (by "Foolish Burial") or removed from play (by "Gold Sarcophagus"). The card removed by "Gold Sarcophagus" will be added to the hand.
    *   VS. "Magical Merchant": the mandatory FLIP Effect activates, but the excavated Spell / Trap Card is sent to the Graveyard instead of being added to your hand.
*   The ② Quick Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in the Summon negation timing (like "Black Horn of Heaven").
    *   Sending "Thunder King Rai-Oh" to the Graveyard is a cost. This is not a Tribute. You cannot activate this effect while "Macro Cosmos" is active.
    *   This effect cannot negate a Card Effect (ex: "Debris Dragon") that Special Summons a monster(s).
