# SAMSARA LOTUS

*   Both of "Samsara Lotus'" effects are Trigger Effects.
*   If you chain a Quick-Play Spell Card from your hand to your "Samsara Lotus'" Special Summon effect, "Samsara Lotus'" effect disappears.
*   If "Book of Moon", etc., is chained to "Samsara Lotus'" damage inflicting effect and flips it face-down, the effect disappears.
