### Card Rulings

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate, it applies on the field.
    *   This effect only applies if you control another "Six Samurai" monster with a different name.
    *   If your other “Six Samurai” is flipped face-down / leaves the field before the Damage Step (of the direct attack), a replay occurs. Do not proceed to the Damage Step for the direct attack.
*   The ② Continuous Effect does not activate, it applies while the destruction occurs.
    *   This effect does not target.
    *   You cannot destroy a face-down "Six Samurai" monster instead.
    *   You can apply this effect when an effect that destroys this card resolves (ex: "Call of the Haunted").
    *   Your other "Six Samurai" is considered destroyed by this effect, not by battle / card effect.
        *   Example: If “Ring of Destruction” targets a “Six Samurai” monster, and you destroy a different “Six Samurai” monster instead, zero damage will be inflicted by “Ring of Destruction”.
    *   You can apply this effect in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation. The “Six Samurai” that you destroy instead is sent to the Graveyard in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   If multiple "Six Samurai" would be destroyed at once, you can destroy 1 other "Six Samurai" for each you wish to protect. You cannot only destroy 1 “Six Samurai” to protect all the others.
        *   Example: If "Mirror Force" would destroy 2 of your "Six Samurai" monsters, you must destroy 2 Defense Position "Six Samurai" monsters to save those two
        *   Example: If "Mirror Force" would destroy all your face-up "Six Samurai" monsters, you cannot destroy any of them as substitutes.
    *   If you control 2 “Six Samurai” monsters, and 1 of them equipped with “Legendary Ebon Steed” would be destroyed, the effect of “Legendary Ebon Steed” must be used. You cannot choose to destroy another “Six Samurai” monster instead.
