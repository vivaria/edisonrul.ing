*   You may select a Warrior-Type Fusion Monster or Synchro Monster in your Graveyard, but it will be returned to the Extra Deck instead of your hand.
*   You may select any Warrior-Type monster to return to your hand, regardless of its Summoning requirements. So you may select a "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" even if it was never properly Summoned.
