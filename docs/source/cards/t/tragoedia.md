### Card Rulings

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the hand.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation (after Battle Damage is dealt).
    *   This effect can activate if you take Battle Damage when your "Vanity's Fiend" is destroyed by battle.
*   The ② Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   This card's original ATK is treated as 0 (while negated by "Skill Drain").
    *   This effect constantly re-calculates the ATK/DEF. "Megamorph" / "Shrink" have no effect \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=795807)\].
    *   This effect stops re-calculating the ATK/DEF if changed by "Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind", "Black Garden", etc \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/105886-tragoedia-being-summoned-while-black-garden-is-active/&tab=comments#comment-2112568)\].
*   The ③ Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Sending 1 monster from your hand to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   This effect cannot be activated while "Macro Cosmos" is active.
    *   This targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down, it does not change control.
*   The ④ Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect targets a monster in the Graveyard. It is negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   The Level change expires in the End Phase.
    *   The Level change no longer applies if "Tragoedia" is flipped face-down / leaves the field.
    *   VS. "Level Eater": If "Level Eater" lowered the Level of "Tragoedia", then "Tragoedia" changed its Level by its ④ effect, "Tragoedia" becomes the target's Level until the End Phase (the effect of "Level Eater" is no longer applied, even after the effect of "Tragoedia" disappears). However, if "Tragoedia" changes its Level and later "Level Eater" changes it again: during the End Phase, "Tragoedia"'s effect wears off and the change made by "Level Eater" still applies.

### Card Rulings

The ① Effect:
● This effect activates in Substep 5.
●If "X-Saber Airbellum" inflicted direct damage, you can activate this as chain link 2 (before a random card is chosen).
● You can only activate 1 trigger effect in your hand per chain, so you can't activate the ① in the same chain as your "Gorz the Emissary of Darkness".

The ② Effect:
● Vs "Limit Reverse" and "Sangan":
This card's ATK is ? while in Deck/GY/Banished, so these cards cannot Summon/Search it.
● Vs "Shrink":
This effect halves the original ATK (0) to 0. It immediately regains ATK for each card in hand.
● Vs "Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind" and "Black Garden":
These effects make the current ATK "become" halved.
The ATK remains halved and won't change even if number of cards in hand does.

The ③ Effect:
● If that target isn't face-up at resolution, control is not changed.

The ④ Effect:
● If that target leaves the GY, this card's level is not changed.
