# Thunder Of Ruler

> You can only activate this card during your opponent's Standby Phase. Your opponent cannot conduct his/her Battle Phase this turn.

*   When you activate "Thunder of Ruler", since your opponent cannot enter the Battle Phase, your opponent proceeds from Main Phase 1 to the End Phase.
*   VS. "Frozen Soul": The effect of "Frozen Soul" cannot be removed if your opponent cannot conduct their Battle Phase (by "Thunder of Ruler"). If "Thunder of Ruler" and "Frozen Soul" both resolved before your opponent attempted to enter their Battle Phase, then this first Battle Phase cannot be conducted (because of "Thunder of Ruler"), and the lingering effect of "Frozen Soul" will persist until a later turn where your opponent attempts to conduct their Battle Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/144344-frozen-soul-and-thunder-of-ruler/)\].
