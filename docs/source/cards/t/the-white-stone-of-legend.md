# The White Stone Of Legend

> ① When this card is sent to the Graveyard, add 1 "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" from your Deck to your hand.

*   This ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
*   This effect will activate even if no copies of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" remain in your Deck. In this case: your opponent can briefly check your Deck to verify, unless all 3 copies of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" can be accounted for in the Graveyard / field / removed from play (face-up).
*   This effect will activate even when "The White Stone of Legend" was discarded for hand size. In this case: discarding for hand size is the very last action in the End Phase. Only mandatory effects and Counter Trap Cards can be activated beyond this point.
    *   Example: It is Player A's End Phase and they have a Set "Divine Wrath" from a previous turn. Player A discards two copies of "The White Stone of Legend" to bring their hand size down to 6 cards. However, "The White Stone of Legend" has a mandatory Trigger Effect to add a "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" from the Deck to the hand, and Player B controls a "Doomcaliber Knight". Thus, a chain is built with both "The White Stone of Legend"'s effects forming a chain as Chain Links 1 and 2, and "Doomcaliber Knight" Tributing itself as Chain Link 3. Player A activates "Divine Wrath" as Chain Link 4 and discards a card as cost. When resolving the chain, "Divine Wrath" will successfully negate the effect of "Doomcaliber Knight", then both effects of "The White Stone of Legend" will add a copy of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" to Player A's hand (should any remain in the Deck). Once the chain has resolved, no chains may be built (unless mandatory Trigger/Trigger-like Effects were activated) and Player A must once again discard down to their hand limit and the turn ends.
