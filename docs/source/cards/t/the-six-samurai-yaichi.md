### Card Text

> ① Once per turn, while you control another "Six Samurai" monster with a different name, you can destroy 1 Set Spell or Trap Card. This monster cannot declare an attack during the turn this effect is used. ② If this card would be destroyed, you can destroy another "Six Samurai" monster you control instead.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect targets a face-down Spell / Trap Card anywhere on the field.
    *   You must control another face-up "Six Samurai" to activate & resolve this effect.
    *   If your other "Six Samurai" is flipped face-down / leaves the field, the target is not destroyed.
    *   If "The Six Samurai - Yaichi" is flipped face-down / leaves the field, the target is still destroyed.
    *   If “Yaichi” attacks, is flipped face-down then flipped face-up, you cannot use its effect that turn.
    *   If this effect is used and “Skill Drain” is activated later, “Yaichi” still cannot attack that turn.
*   The ② Continuous Effect does not activate, it applies while the destruction occurs.
    *   This effect does not target.
    *   You cannot destroy a face-down "Six Samurai" monster instead.
    *   You can apply this effect when an effect that destroys this card resolves (ex: "Call of the Haunted").
    *   Your other "Six Samurai" is considered destroyed by this effect, not by battle / card effect.
        *   Example: If “Ring of Destruction” targets a “Six Samurai” monster, and you destroy a different “Six Samurai” monster instead, zero damage will be inflicted by “Ring of Destruction”.
    *   You can apply this effect in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation. The “Six Samurai” that you destroy instead is sent to the Graveyard in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   If multiple "Six Samurai" would be destroyed at once, you can destroy 1 other "Six Samurai" for each you wish to protect. You cannot only destroy 1 “Six Samurai” to protect all the others.
        *   Example: If "Mirror Force" would destroy 2 of your "Six Samurai" monsters, you must destroy 2 Defense Position "Six Samurai" monsters to save those two
        *   Example: If "Mirror Force" would destroy all your face-up "Six Samurai" monsters, you cannot destroy any of them as substitutes.
    *   If you control 2 “Six Samurai” monsters, and 1 of them equipped with “Legendary Ebon Steed” would be destroyed, the effect of “Legendary Ebon Steed” must be used. You cannot choose to destroy another “Six Samurai” monster instead.
