# Trap Reactor Y Fi

*   This effect does not negate the Trap Card’s effect; it merely destroys the Trap Card. This is a Trigger Effect that activates by chaining it to the activation of the Trap Card. It does not target. This effect can be activated during the Damage Step. If the Trap Card cannot be destroyed when this effect resolves (example: it was destroyed by another card effect already), then you do not inflict 800 damage to your opponent.
