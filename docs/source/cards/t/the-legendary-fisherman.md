*   If you Special Summon "The Legendary Fisherman" with "Premature Burial", when "Premature Burial" is destroyed while "Umi" is face-up on the field "The Legendary Fisherman" is not destroyed.
*   If a face-up "The Legendary Fisherman" is the only monster you control, when your opponent's monsters attack they attack you directly.
*   If a Spell Card is activated that would destroy "Umi" and a face-up "The Legendary Fisherman" simultaneously, "Umi" is destroyed but "The Legendary Fisherman" is not.
*   If your opponent has "Messenger of Peace" or "Swords of Revealing Light" face-up on their side of the field, "The Legendary Fisherman" can attack if "Umi" is face-up on the field. If your opponent has "Toll", you do not pay. If your opponent has "Gravekeeper's Servant", you do not send a card from the top of your Deck to your Graveyard.
*   If "The Legendary Fisherman" is equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" while "Umi" is face-up on the field, the effect of "Ring of Magnetism" is not applied.
