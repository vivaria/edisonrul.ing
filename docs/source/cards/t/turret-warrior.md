### Card Rulings

*   You can Tribute a face-down Warrior for “Turret Warrior”, and it will still gain the appropriate ATK. You can Tribute a Warrior-Type Token monster to Special Summon “Turret Warrior”, or a card like “Embodiment of Apophis” that is currently a Warrior.
*   “Turret Warrior” still gains the appropriate ATK in these cases. If you Tribute a Warrior with variable ATK, like “Evil Hero Dark Gaia”, the original ATK is treated as 0 so “Turret Warrior” gains no bonus ATK.
*   Tributing a Warrior to Special Summon “Turret Warrior” is not a cost; both the Tribute and the ATK increase are part of the effect.
