# The Emperor'S Holiday

*   You can chain "The Emperor’s Holiday" to "Premature Burial" and the effect of "Premature Burial" will be negated and the targeted monster will never leave the Graveyard. If "Premature Burial" is already active when you activate "The Emperor’s Holiday" the equipped monster is unaffected.
