*   If an effect is chained to "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn"'s effect that would increase your opponent's Life Points, so that your opponent's Life Points are higher than yours when its effect resolves, then "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn"'s effect disappears because your Life Points need to be higher than your opponent's when the effect resolves.
