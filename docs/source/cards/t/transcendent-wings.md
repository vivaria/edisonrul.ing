# Transcendent Wings

*   You can send a face-down “Winged Kuriboh” to the Graveyard to activate the effect of “Transcendent Wings”.
*   You can activate “Transcendent Wings” even if there is no “Winged Kuriboh LV10” in your hand or Deck, but you must show your Deck to the opponent if they want to confirm.
