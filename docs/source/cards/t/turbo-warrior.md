# Turbo Warrior

*   "Turbo Warrior"'s first effect activates when the attack is declared. If it attacks a face-down Synchro Monster, "Turbo Warrior"'s effect does not activate.
*   "Turbo Warrior"'s effects do not target.
*   If "Turbo Warrior" attacks a Level 6 or higher Synchro Monster and an effect is chained that changes the attack target to a different monster, the new attack target monster has its ATK halved instead.
