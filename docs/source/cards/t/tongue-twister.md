# Tongue Twister

> ① If this card was Tribute Summoned, when it is sent from the field to the Graveyard, draw 2 cards and remove this card from play.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   The effect of "Tongue Twister" will only activate if it was Tribute Summoned. It will not activate if it was Tribute Set \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=826682)\].
    *   The "Draw" and "Remove from Play" portions of this effect are not considered to resolve simultaneously. Resolve this effect sequentially: draw 2, then banish "Tongue Twister" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=1014618)\].
*   VS. "Necrovalley": While "Necrovalley" is active, "Tongue Twister"'s effect still activates. You will draw 2 cards, and then fail to banish "Tongue Twister" as "Necrovalley" prevents both players from banishing cards in the Graveyard.
