### Card Rulings

*   If you Tribute Summon “Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch” successfully, and your opponent discards a monster like “Oustanding Dog Marron” or “Regenerating Mummy”, you still inflict damage because the monster was discarded to the Graveyard (even though it doesn’t remain there).
*   If “Banisher of the Light” is face-up on the field, no damage is inflicted because the card is not discarded to the Graveyard.
*   This card's effect always activates when Tribute Summoned, even if your opponent has no cards in their hand.
