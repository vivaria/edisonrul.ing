# Tuner’S Scheme

*   This card continuously targets the Synchro Monster.If you take control of a Synchro Monster with “Tuner’s Scheme” and then the monster is flipped face-down, you keep control of it, but it is no longer targeted by “Tuner’s Scheme.”
*   If your opponent uses “Brain Control” to take control of the monster you took control of with “Tuner’s Scheme” and the monster is destroyed, “Tuner’s Scheme” is destroyed as well.
*   If “Tuner’s Scheme” is removed from the field, its effect no longer applies and your opponent regains control of the Synchro Monster.
