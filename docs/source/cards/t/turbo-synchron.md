# Turbo Synchron

① When this card declares an attack, you can change the attack target to Defense Position. ② When you take Battle Damage while this card is attacking, you can Special Summon 1 monster from your hand with ATK equal to or less than the Battle Damage you took.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates at the Start of the Battle Step - Attack Declaration (like "Mirror Force").
    *   This does not target the opponent's monster.
    *   If "Turbo Synchron" attacks an Attack Position "Berserk Gorilla" and activates its effect, "Berserk Gorilla" is shifted to Defense Position and destroyed. A replay occurs but this effect cannot be activated again, since as the Attack Declaration timing has concluded.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation (after Battle Damage is dealt).
    *   "Turbo Synchron" must be face-up on the field (not destroyed by battle) to activate this effect.
    *   This effect cannot activate if "0" Battle Damage was dealt while "Waboku" applies.
    *   If the Special Summoned monster has a Trigger Effects (ex: "Red Gadget"), it can activate and start another manual chain in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation.
    *   Continuous Effects of the Special Summoned monster take effect immediately.
