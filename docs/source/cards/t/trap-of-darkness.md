### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> â‘  If your LP is 3000 or less: Pay 1000 LP, then target 1 Normal Trap in your GY, except "Trap of Darkness"; this card's effect becomes that target's activated effect, then banish that target.

### Card Rulings

*   If the target is removed from your GY before this resolves, you do not apply its effect.
*   You apply the target's effect, but do not pay its costs.
*   If applying an effect that targets, you choose targets when Trap of Darkness is activated.
*   If applying the effect of "Scrap-Iron Scarecrow", this card Sets itself when it resolves.
*   You cannot apply an effect that equips (if banishing "Kunai with Chain", you can apply its 1st effect, but not the equip effect).
