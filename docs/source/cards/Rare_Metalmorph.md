# RARE METALMORPH  
> ① Select 1 face-up Machine-Type monster. It gains 500 ATK. One time only, negate the effect of a Spell Card that targets that monster. ② When the selected monster is removed from the field, destroy this card.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies on the field.
    *   This effect (continuously) targets a face-up Machine-Type monster anywhere on the field.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down / leaves the field, this card remains face-up meaninglessly.
    *   If the Machine-Type monster is targeted by either player's Spell Card, that effect is negated when it resolves. A Continuous-like / Lingering Effect that targets a Machine-Type is permanently negated.
    *   If you chain "Rare Metalmorph" to "Ekibyo Drakmord" that targets a Machine-Type monster, "Ekibyo Drakmord" is equipped but its effect is negated while "Rare Metalmorph" is active.
    *   You can activate this card during the Damage Step.
*   The ② Continuous-like Effect applies on the field. This does not start a Chain.
    *   This effect applies if the target is destroyed / removed from play / returned to the hand or Deck.
    *   This effect can be negated by "Royal Decree".
