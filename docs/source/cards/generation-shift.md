# Generation Shift

*   Destroying your monster for “Generation Shift” is not a cost. It’s part of the effect.
*   You can target a Limited monster with “Generation Shift”, but after destroying the monster you don’t search or shuffle your Deck.
*   You can target a Token Monster with “Generation Shift” and it will be destroyed, but you do not search or shuffle your Deck (this part of the effect is not resolved).
*   If you target “Proto-Cyber Dragon” or “Elemental Hero Neo Bubbleman” with this effect, you must add “Proto-Cyber Dragon” or “Elemental Hero Neo Bubbleman” to your hand. You cannot add “Cyber Dragon” or “Elemental Hero Bubbleman”.
