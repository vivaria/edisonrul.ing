# SPIRIT ELIMINATION

*   During the turn that "Spirit Elimination" is activated; all monsters removed from play must be from your side of the field. This means that you cannot activated "Soul Release" and remove two monsters from your side of the field and three from your Graveyard.
*   Any conditions set on the Monster Cards that would be removed from the Graveyard must still be fulfilled on the Monsters removed from your side of the field. For example, to Special Summon "Dark Necrofear" you must remove 3 Fiend-Type Monsters from your side of the field.
*   You can activate "Spirit Elimination" while "Necrovalley" is active.
