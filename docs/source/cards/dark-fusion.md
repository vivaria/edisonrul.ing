# DARK FUSION

> Send, from your hand or your side of the field to the Graveyard, Fusion Material Monsters that are listed on a Fiend-Type Fusion Monster Card, and Special Summon that Fusion Monster from your Fusion Deck. (This Special Summon is treated as a Fusion Summon). The Special Summoned monster cannot be targeted by the effects of your opponent's Monsters, Spells, and Traps this turn.

*   When you Special Summon a Fiend-Type Fusion Monster with “Dark Fusion” and during the same turn control of the Fiend-Type Fusion Monster is shifted to your opponent (with “Creature Swap”, etc.), your opponent still cannot target that Fiend-Type Fusion Monster with the effects of Spell, Trap, or Monster Cards until the end of the turn, even though they now control the Fiend-Type Fusion Monster.
*   If the Fiend-Type Fusion Monster Fusion Summoned by “Dark Fusion” is sent to the Graveyard, the effect that prevents it from being targeted by the opponent’s Spell, Trap, and Monster Card effects is no longer applied.
*   If the Fiend-Type Fusion Monster Fusion Summoned by “Dark Fusion” is flipped face-down, the effect that prevents it from being targeted by the opponent’s Spell, Trap, and Monster Card effects is no longer applied.
