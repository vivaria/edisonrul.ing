# METEORAIN

*   You can activate "Meteorain" during your turn at any point from the Draw Phase to the end of your Battle Phase; you cannot activate it during the Damage Step, Main Phase 2, your End Phase, or your opponent's turn.
*   "Meteorain"'s effect applies to all your monsters. Monsters that you Summon, Flip Summon, Special Summon, etc. after activating "Meteorain" still get its effect.
*   When you attack with a monster that has "Meteorain"'s bonus, and you attack a Defense Position "Amazoness Swordswoman", then you will take the Battle Damage to your Life Points.
