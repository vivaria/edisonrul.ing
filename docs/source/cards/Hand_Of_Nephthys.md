# HAND OF NEPHTHYS

*   "Tribute 2 monsters on your side of the field, including this card" means that you Tribute "Hand of Nephthys" plus 1 additional monster.
*   Ignition Effects on monsters cannot be activated while the Effect Monster is face-down. So this face-down monster cannot be Tributed for its own effect.
*   You can chain to the activation of this monster’s effect.
*   Tributing monsters is a cost of this card’s effect.
*   You can Tribute a Monster Token as part of this card’s cost.
*   You can chain to the activation of "Hand of Nephthys’" effect with the effect of "Royal Oppression" to negate the Special Summon of "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys".
