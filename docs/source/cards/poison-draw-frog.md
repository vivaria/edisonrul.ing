# Poison Draw Frog

> ① When this face-up card on the field is sent to the Graveyard (unless it was attacked while face-down and destroyed by battle), you can draw 1 card.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
*   This effect will activate if the last thing to happen was "Poison Draw Frog":
    *   being sent from the Monster Card Zone to the Graveyard as a result of battle (while face-up Before the Damage Step);
    *   being sent from the Monster Card Zone to the Graveyard by card effect (ex: "Torrential Tribute" resolved as Chain Link 1);
    *   being sent from the Spell / Trap Card Zone to the Graveyard while being treated as a face-up Equip Spell Card by the effect of "Relinquished".
*   This effect will NOT activate if "Poison Drag Frog" was face-down when selected as an attack target.
