# EMISSARY OF THE AFTERLIFE

*   If neither player has a Level 3 or lower Normal Monster in their Deck, the effect of "Emissary of the Afterlife" disappears BUT both players get to look at their opponent's Decks before they are shuffled.
*   If only 1 player as a Level 3 or lower Normal Monster in their Deck, then that player gets to add the monster to his hand.
*   You select monsters when the effect resolves. The effect of "Emissary of the Afterlife" does not target.
