# RAVIEL, LORD OF PHANTASMS

*   You can Tribute face-down Fiends to Special Summon “Raviel, Lord of Phantasms”.
*   Tributing 1 monster is a cost to activate this card’s Ignition Effect. You cannot Tribute this card for its own effect.
*   Summoning a “Phantasm Token” is a Trigger Effect that activates when the opponent Normal Summons a monster. The activation of this effect can be chained to.
*   If “Skill Drain” is activated, any “Phantasm Tokens” on the field still cannot attack. (Also, while “Skill Drain” is active, “Raviel, Lord of Phantasms” will not generate any more “Phantasm Tokens”.)
*   A “Phantasm Token” cannot be forced to attack with a card effect like “Dark Spirit of the Silent” or “Amazoness Archers”.
*   If your opponent Normal Summons a monster in a chain using “Ultimate Offering”, resolve all effects in that chain, then activate the effect of “Raviel, Lord of Phantasms” to start a new chain. If the Normal Summon for “Ultimate Offering” was Chain Link 2 or higher, you still activate the effect of “Raviel”. It does not miss the timing.
*   If all of your Monster Card Zones are full, this card’s effect will activate, but if there are no available spaces when the effect resolves, the effect is not applied.
*   If an effect is chained to turn “Raviel, Lord of Phantasms” face-down, or remove it from the field, the “Phantasm Token” will still be Special Summoned when the effect resolves.
