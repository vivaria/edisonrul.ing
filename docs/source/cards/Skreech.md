# SKREECH

*   “Skreech's” effect activates at the end of Damage Step, when monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the Graveyard, but "Skreech" does not have to be "sent to the Graveyard". "Skreech"'s effect activates in its owner's Graveyard (or Removed Zone, etc.)
*   If you take control of your opponent's "Skreech", and it is destroyed as a result of battle, then your opponent (the original owner) will activate its effect.
