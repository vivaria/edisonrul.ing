### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> When this card is Normal Summoned: You can target 1 Level 2 or lower monster in your GY; Special Summon that target in Defense Position (but negate its effects).

### Card Rulings

If you activate the effect of a monster summoned this way:
● Any costs will be paid as usual.
● However, the effect will resolve negated, as the effect was activated on the field, where its effects were being negated.
EG: ＂Substitoad＂ summoned this way tributes itself. Its effect is negated, since its effect was activated on the field.

If a monster summoned this way becomes flipped face-down or leaves the field, its effects are no longer negated, starting from the moment it leaves the field.
EG: ＂Mad Reloader＂ summoned this way is destroyed by battle. Its effect is not negated, since its effect was not activated on the field.
