# Jade Insect Whistle

*   The monster selected for "Jade Insect Whistle" is chosen when the effect resolves, not when it is activated, so "Jade Insect Whistle" doesn't target.
*   If your opponent claims to have no Insect-Type monsters in his/her Deck when your "Jade Insect Whistle" resolves, you can check the Deck to make sure.
*   A face-up "Parasite Paracide" can be selected with "Jade Insect Whistle".
