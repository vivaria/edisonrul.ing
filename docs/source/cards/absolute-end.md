# ABSOLUTE END

> Activate only during your opponent's turn. This turn, the attacks from your opponent's monsters become direct attacks.

*   When "Absolute End" is activated during an attack, that attack becomes a direct attack.
*   If "Taunt" and "Absolute End" are both active, the attack becomes a direct attack to your Life Points. This is because the attack target is the monster selected by "Taunt", but then "Absolute End" turns it into a direct attack.
