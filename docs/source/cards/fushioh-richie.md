# FUSHIOH RICHIE

*   "Fushioh Richie" cannot negate cards like "Bottomless Trap Hole", or "Kisetai", because they do not target.
*   When your opponent uses "Double Snare" on "Fushioh Richie", "Double Snare" is negated and destroyed.
*   You can use "Premature Burial" or "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Fushioh Richie" from your Graveyard, as long as "Fushioh Richie" was Special Summoned using the proper method ("Great Dezard") previously.
*   When "Fushioh Richie" is flipped face-up, you can Special Summon a high-level Zombie from your Graveyard (like "Vampire Lord" or "Ryu Kokki").
*   "Fusioh Richie"â€™s effect is activated if attacked and flipped face-up by the attack, or if Flip Summoned, or if flipped face-up by a card effect.
