# Core Blast

*   This effect does not target.
*   You can destroy any cards your opponent controls, not just monsters.
*   If you do not control a face-up “Koa’ki Meiru” monster when the effect of “Core Blast” resolves, you can still destroy your opponent’s cards.
*   You can activate the effect of “Core Blast” in the same Chain that you flip the card face-up.
