> ① You can discard 1 card to select 1 card on the field and roll a six-sided die. If the result is not 1 or 6, destroy the selected card.

*   This ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect targets a (face-up / face-down) card anywhere on the field.
    *   Discarding 1 card is a cost.
*   It is unknown whether a card will be destroyed, therefore cards whose activation requirement specify 'when your opponent activates a card or effect that would destroy a card(s) on the field' cannot be activated in response to this effect (such as "Stardust Dragon", "Destruction Jammer", and "My Body as a Shield").
