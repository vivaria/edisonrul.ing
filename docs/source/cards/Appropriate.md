# APPROPRIATE

> Activate only when your opponent draws a card(s), except during their Draw Phase. Draw 2 cards.

*   "Appropriate" can only be activated if the last effect on the Chain ends with your opponent drawing a card(s) outside of their Draw Phase. (See "Missing the Timing - Optional Trigger Effects" in the Advanced Gameplay FAQ for more information.)
*   If your opponent "picks up" cards with "Morphing Jar #2", etc., you do not draw.
*   If you have 2 face-up "Appropriate", you will draw 4 cards when your opponent draws a card(s) outside of their Draw Phase.
*   If you and your opponent have "Appropriate" face-up and you or your opponent draw a card outside of your respective Draw Phases, the effect of each "Appropriate" is applied until you or your opponent cannot Draw a card and lose the Duel or gather all 5 pieces of "Exodia" into your respective hand and win the Duel. This process does not start a Chain.
