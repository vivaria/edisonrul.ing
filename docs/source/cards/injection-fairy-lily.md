# Injection Fairy Lily

*   You can activate this card’s effect during both players’ Damage Steps, at damage calculation. You can activate it only once per Damage Step, but if "Injection Fairy Lily" is involved in multiple battles in the same turn, you can activate it once during each battle.
*   You cannot increase this card’s ATK by 6000 points by paying 4000 Life Points.
*   The ATK increase only lasts for that 1 Damage Step. If this card is involved in multiple battles during the same turn, you must pay 2000 Life Points each battle if you wish to keep increasing its ATK.
*   Activating this card’s effect does not cause a replay.
*   You may activate this card’s effect even when it is attacking directly.
*   If your "Injection Fairy Lily" is in battle with the opponent’s "Injection Fairy Lily" the turn player must decide to use its effect or not first. The opponent can then activate their "Injection Fairy Lily" effect. If both effects are activated, it forms a chain.
*   If this card is equipped with "Heart of Clear Water" and you activate its effect to increase its ATK, the "Heart of Clear Water" is immediately destroyed.
*   The effect of "Mirror Wall" will reduce "Injection Fairy Lily"’s ATK by half before you decide to use its effect or not. So if you activate its effect, its ATK will be 3200. If 2 copies of "Mirror Wall" are active, its ATK will be 3100.
