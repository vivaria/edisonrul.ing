# Necroface

> ① When this card is Normal Summoned, shuffle all removed from play cards into their owner's Decks. This card gains 100 ATK for each of those cards. ② When this card is removed from play, both players remove from play the top 5 cards of their Deck.

*   The ① Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates even if no cards are removed from play.
    *   This effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Trap Hole").
    *   Cards removed from play face-down (by "Different Dimension Capsule") are also affected.
*   The ② Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates even if "Necroface" changed locations.
    *   Example 1: "Necroface" removed from play as cost for "Skull Lair" (Chain Link 1), and is Special Summoned by "Escape from the Dark Dimension" (Chain Link 2).
    *   Example 2: "Necroface" removed from play as cost for "Skull Lair" (Chain Link 1), and is returned to the Graveyard by "Burrial from a Different Dimension" (Chain Link 2).
    *   Example 3: "Necroface" is Normal Summoned and activates it's ① effect (Chain Link 1) simultaneously with the effect of "Future Visions" (Chain Link 2). When resolving the chain: "Necroface" is first removed from play by "Future Visions", then shuffled back into the Deck by it's ① effect. A new chain starts since "Necroface"'s ② effect has met its trigger condition.
