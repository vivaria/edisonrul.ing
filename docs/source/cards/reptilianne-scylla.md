# REPTILIANNE SCYLLA

*   This is a Trigger Effect. It does not target.
*   If you Summon a monster like "[Exiled Force](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Exiled_Force)" that has an effect that activates on the field and then activate its effect, it will still be negated. If you Summon a monster like "[Sangan](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Sangan)" with an effect that activates in the Graveyard, it will not be negated.
*   This card looks at the ATK of the destroyed monster during damage calculation. If a monster with an original ATK of 0 is destroyed by battle with "[Reptilianne Scylla](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Reptilianne_Scylla)" while its ATK is increased by another effect, you cannot Special Summon it. If a monster whose ATK is reduced to 0 by an effect like "[Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Twin_Swords_of_Flashing_Light_-_Tryce)" is destroyed by battle with "[Reptilianne Scylla](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Reptilianne_Scylla)", you can Special Summon it.
