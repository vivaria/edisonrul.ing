# XING ZHEN HU

*   You can chain one of the 2 Spell or Trap Cards on the field to the activation of "Xing Zhen Hu". However, the remaining one will not be able to be activated after "Xing Zhen Hu" resolves.
*   If neither of the targeted Spell or Trap Cards is on the field when "Xing Zhen Hu" resolves, then "Xing Zhen Hu" remains on the field meaninglessly.
