*   Returning 1 “Iron Core of Koka’ki Meiru” from your hand to the top of the Deck is a cost. If your opponent Chains “Book of Moon” to this effect to turn a Special Summoned monster face-down, it will still be destroyed. This effect will destroy monsters that have been Special Summoned in face-down Defense Position by effects like “Morphing Jar #2.”
