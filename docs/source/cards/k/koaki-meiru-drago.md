### Card Rulings

● While the ① is applying, "Future Fusion" can't be activated unless a non-LIGHT/DARK is revealed from the Extra Deck.
● While the ① is applying, "Future Fusion" can't Special Summon a LIGHT-DARK monster during the second Standby Phase. In this case, the Fusion Monster will never be Special Summoned (it won't "try again" the next Standby Phase).
● The Ⓜ is a Maintenance Cost. It does not activate, and can't be negated.
● If Iron Core can't be sent to the GY (EG if "Macro Cosmos" is applying), and no Dragon can be revealed, this card is destroyed.
● If "Mind on Air" is applying, you can't reveal a Dragon, so you must send an Iron Core to the GY or else destroy this card.
● If this card is destroyed by battle, its effect stops applying in Substep 6 (“Tragoedia” can't be activated)
