### Card Rulings

*   This ① optional "_When... you can..." Trigger Effect can miss the timing.
    *   This effect targets 1 or 2 cards on the field.
    *   The "_destroy_" and "_draw_" parts are considered to resolve simultaneously.
    *   If a target cannot be destroyed, the other is still destroyed.
    *   If a target(s) cannot be destroyed, no card is drawn for it.
    *   Drawing a card(s) for your destroyed card(s) is OPTIONAL. Don't make irreparable gamestates...
    *   If a target changes control, its controller can draw 1 card when it is destroyed.
    *   If 2 of your cards were destroyed, you choose to draw 2 cards or 0 cards, you cannot draw 1 card.
*   The ② Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   This effect does not apply if Kuraz' effects are negated.

### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① can't attack the turn it was Normal/Special Summoned.
> ② When Normal/Special Summoned:
> You can target up to 2 cards on the field; destroy those targets, and if you do, each player can draw 1 card for each of their cards destroyed this way.

### Card Rulings

*   Destroying and drawing are simultaneous.
This does not cause anything to miss its timing.
*   If 1 target is no longer on the field when this resolves, the other is still destroyed.
