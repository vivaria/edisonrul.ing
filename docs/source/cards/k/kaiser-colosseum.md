### Card Rulings

*   The Continuous Effect only applies while you control 1+ monster(s).
*   Your opponent can still Flip Summon monsters.
*   Your opponent can still activate Brain Control / Mind Control.
*   Your opponent can Tribute Summon if they would then control equal / fewer monsters than you do.
*   Your opponent can't Tribute Summon if they would still control more monsters than you do.
*   Your opponent can't activate cards / effects that Summon (ex: Scapegoat, Call of the Haunted).
*   VS. Cyber Jar: if your opponent would control more monsters, they must destroy monsters equal to the difference; the excess monsters are never actually Summoned and instead are sent from the Deck to the GY (so Sangan does not get its effect). So the monsters are destroyed after they are picked up, but before any monsters are Special Summoned for the effect of Cyber Jar.
*   If there are already more monsters on your opponent's side of the field when you activate Kaiser Colosseum, nothing happens to them but your opponent can't Summon any more.
