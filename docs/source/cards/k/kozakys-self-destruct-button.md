# Kozaky'S Self-Destruct Button

*   You cannot activate “Kozaky’s Self-Destruct Button” because it has no activation effect.
*   If “Bait Doll” targets “Kozaky’s Self-Destruct Button”, nothing happens because the timing is inappropriate. However, “Kozaky’s Self-Destruct Button” is then destroyed by “Bait Doll”.
*   “Kozaky’s Self-Destruct Button” starts a chain at the time that it is sent to the Graveyard. If “Banisher of the Light” is on the field and “Kozaky’s Self-Destruct Button” is removed from play, its effect still activates because it only has to be destroyed.
