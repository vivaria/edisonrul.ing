# King Of The Swamp

> ① You can substitute this card for any 1 Fusion Material Monster. When you do this, the other Fusion Material Monster(s) must be the correct one(s). ② Discard this card from your hand to the Graveyard to add a "Polymerization" from your Deck to your hand. The Deck is then shuffled.

*   The ① effect does not have any classification. It is not an Ignition, Trigger, Quick, or Continuous Effect.
    *   This effect does not target.
    *   Using "King of the Swamp" as a Fusion Material does not start a Chain Link.
    *   This effect is not applied while in the Deck or removed from play.
    *   This card can't be used to Summon "Chimeratech Fortress Dragon" or "XYZ-Dragon Cannon".
    *   VS. "Prohibition": A "King of the Swamp" in the hand cannot apply this effect, but a "King of the Swamp" that was in the Graveyard (before "Prohibition" was activated) can apply this effect.
*   The ② Ignition Effect activates and resolves in the hand.
    *   Discarding this card is a cost.
    *   You only add 1 copy of "Polymerization".
    *   This effect cannot activate if you have no copy of "Polymerization" in your Deck.
    *   This effect cannot activate if "Prohibition" declares "King of the Swamp".
    *   This effect cannot activate if you use "King of the Swamp" as Fusion Material from your hand.
