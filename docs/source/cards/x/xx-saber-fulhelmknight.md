> ① Once while this card is face-up on the field, if an opponent's monster declares an attack:
> You can target that attacking monster; negate the attack.
> ② If this card destroys a Defense Position monster by battle:
> You can target 1 level 4 or lower “X-Saber” monster in your GY; Special Summon that target.

### Card Rulings

*   The ② effect will trigger even if the destroyed monster was not sent to the GY.
*   Cards stating “If this card destroys a monster by battle:”, without “and sends it to the GY”,
will trigger even if they are destroyed by an effect after Damage Calculation.
(For example, this card’s ② effect will activate even if it is destroyed attacking a set Ryko).
