# SKYSCRAPER

> ① When an "Elemental Hero" monster attacks, if its ATK is lower than the ATK of the attack target, the attacking monster gains 1000 ATK during damage calculation only.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect does not start a chain.
    *   This effect applies during Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.
*   If “Skyscraper” is on the field and you attack a Defense Position monster with an “Elemental Hero” that has ATK lower than the ATK of the Defense Position monster, the “Elemental Hero” gains +1000 ATK even though it was attacking a Defense Position monster.
*   If your opponent’s monster’s ATK is increased during the damage step, like “Injection Fairy Lily” or “Covering Fire”, your “Elemental Hero” will gain the +1000 ATK for “Skyscraper”.
