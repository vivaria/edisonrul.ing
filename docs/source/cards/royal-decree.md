> Negate the effects of all other Trap Cards on the field.

*   Trap Cards (and their effects) can still be activated (played face-up).
*   This effect negates the effects of Trap Cards that activate & resolve on the field.
    *   The effect of a Trap Card sent by a chained "[Emergency Provisions](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Emergency_Provisions)" is still negated.
*   This effect does not negate the effects of Trap Cards that activate in the Graveyard (like "Dark Coffin").
