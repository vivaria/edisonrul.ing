# BLACK WHIRLWIND  
> When a “Blackwing” monster is Normal Summoned to your side of the Field, you can add 1 “Blackwing” monster from your Deck to your hand that has less ATK than that monster.

*   This optional Trigger-like Effect activates in the Summon response timing.
*   Both "Black Whirlwind" and the Normal Summoned "Blackwing" monster must be face-up on the field.
*   This effect still resolves if control of the "Blackwing" monster changes during the chain.
*   The ATK (+ATK modifiers) of the "Blackwing" monster is assessed when resolving this effect.
*   A chain can be built if multiple copies of "Black Whirlwing" were triggered simultaneously.
