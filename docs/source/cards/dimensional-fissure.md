# DIMENSIONAL FISSURE

> ① Any monster sent to the Graveyard is removed from play instead.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect only affects Monster Cards that would be sent to the Graveyard.
    *   Face-down monsters that would be sent to the Graveyard are also removed from play.
    *   Cards/effects whose cost send/discard a monster(s) '_to the Graveyard_' CANNOT activate.
        *   Examples: "Herald of Orange Light", "Card Trooper", and "Jowgen the Spiritualist".
    *   Cards/effects whose cost send/discard a monster(s) CAN activate.
        *   Example: "Magic Jammer", "Dark Grepher".
    *   Cards/effects that send/discard a monster(s) '_to the Graveyard_' at resolution CAN activate.
        *   Examples: "Foolish Burial", "Blaze Accelerator", and "Needlebug Nest".
*   VS. "Archlord Kristya": If a face-up Kristya would be sent from the field to the Graveyard (and removed from play), its effect will still trigger and places it back on top of the Deck.
