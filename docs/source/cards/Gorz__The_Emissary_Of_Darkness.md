# GORZ, THE EMISSARY OF DARKNESS  
> ① When you take damage from a card your opponent controls while you control no cards, you can Special Summon this card from your hand. ② Then activate the appropriate effect based on the type of damage:  
(2A) Battle Damage: Special Summon 1 “Emissary of Darkness Token” (Fairy-Type/ LIGHT/ Level 7/ ATK ?/DEF ?). Its ATK and DEF are each equal to the amount of battle damage you took.  
(2B) Effect Damage: Inflict damage to your opponent equal to the amount of damage you took.

*   The ① optional "_When... you can..._" Trigger Effect can miss the timing.
    *   You cannot activate Gorz's effect and chain the effect of "Tragoedia", etc.
    *   If a direct attack deals battle damage, this effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation.
    *   This effect cannot activate if battle damage was dealt while your monster battled.
    *   This effect will miss the timing if effect damage is inflict as Chain Link 2+.
    *   If "Caius the Shadow Monarch" removes from play your only card on the field, a DARK monster, and inflicts 1000 damage, this effect can be activated
    *   VS. "X-Saber Airbellum": Airbellum's mandatory Trigger Effect is always Chain Link 1, Gorz' ① optional Trigger Effect can be Chain Link 2. A second manual Chain is built in Substep 5 when Gorz' (2A) Trigger Effect activates.
*   The (2A / 2B) mandatory Trigger Effects activate and resolve on the field.
    *   The (2A) effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation. It cannot be negated by "Royal Oppression", but it can be negated by "Swallow Flip". Also, "Torrential Tribute" cannot activate.
    *   When (2A) resolves as Chain Link 1, the last thing to happen is the Special Summon of a Token.
    *   An "Emissary of Darkness Token" targeted by "Shrink" has its ATK reduced to 0 ("?" ATK / "?" DEF original stats are treated as 0 ATK / 0 DEF).
