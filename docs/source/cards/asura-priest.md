# ASURA PRIEST  
> Ⓒ This card cannot be Special Summoned. ① This card returns to its owner's hand during the End Phase of the turn it is Normal Summoned or flipped face-up. ② This card can attack all monsters your opponent controls once each. This monster cannot attack directly if it has already attacked a monster.

*   The Ⓒ Condition is not an effect, it cannot be negated.
*   The ① Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   If the activation of this effect is negated (by "Light and Darkness Dragon"), this effect will activate again until it resolves (even if it resolves without effect due to "Skill Drain").
*   The ② Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   "Asura Priest" may attack directly if it has not already attacked a monster this turn.
    *   "Asura Priest" cannot attack a monster if it has already attacked directly this turn.
    *   These attacks do not have to be all in a row. You can attack monsters with "Asura Priest", then attack with another monster, and "Asura Priest" can still attack again as long as it attacks a monster it has not attacked yet. If the opponent controls "Spirit Reaper" you cannot continually attack it.
    *   "Asura Priest" does not have to attack all your opponent’s monsters.
    *   While "Gravekeeper’s Servant" / "Toll" is active, you pay each time "Asura Priest" attacks.
    *   If “Asura Priest” attacks a monster and your opponent activates “Magic Cylinder” to negate the attack, “Asura Priest” can attack that same monster again.
    *   Your opponent's "Patrician of Darkness" can re-direct all of your “Asura Priest” attacks to their “Spirit Reaper”.
    *   When "Asura Priest" attacks your opponent’s only monster, if the monster is removed from the field in the battle step, a replay occurs. Since Asura Priest never battled with a monster it can attack directly.
