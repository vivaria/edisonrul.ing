# ALTAR FOR TRIBUTE

> Select 1 monster on your side of the field and send it to the Graveyard. Increase your Life Points by an amount equal to the original ATK of the monster.

*   Sending a monster to the Graveyard for "Altar for Tribute" is a cost.
*   You can select a Token Monster as the cost for "Altar for Tribute", but you won't gain any Life Points because Tokens are taken off the field instead of going to the Graveyard.
*   You can send your opponent's monster that you control to the Graveyard as the cost for "Altar for Tribute", and you would gain the Life Points.
