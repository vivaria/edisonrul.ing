# CESTUS OF DAGLA

*   When "Airknight Parshath" equipped with "Cestus of Dagla" inflicts damage to your opponent's Life Points, the simultaneous effects go on a chain, so the controller decides which effect is resolved first.
*   If you have multiple copies of "Cestus of Dagla" equipped to your monster, the effects accumulate.
*   When your opponent takes control of your Fairy-Type monster equipped with your "Cestus of Dagla", and your opponent uses the monster to damage your Life Points, neither player increases their Life Points. This is because the controller of "Cestus of Dagla" is still you, and "Cestus of Dagla"'s effect only activates when the equipped monster inflicts damage to your opponent's Life Points. Likewise, if you equip "Cestus of Dagla" to your opponent's Fairy-Type monster, neither player will gain any Life Points from "Cestus of Dagla".
