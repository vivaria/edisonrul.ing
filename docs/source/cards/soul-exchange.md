# SOUL EXCHANGE

> ① Select 1 monster your opponent controls. This turn you can Tribute that monster as if you controlled it. Ⓒ You cannot conduct your Battle Phase the turn you activate this card.

*   The ① effect of this card targets an opponent's (face-up / face-down) monster.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down, it can still be Tributed \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=925157)\].
    *   Face-down monsters cannot be Tributed for a Ritual Summon or “Metamorphosis” because you do not know their Level, nor for "Deck Devastation Virus" or "Icarus Attack".
    *   You do not gain control of the target, so you can use “Soul Exchange” combined with your “Cannon Soldier’s” effect even if you already have 5 monsters in your Monster Card Zone.
    *   Tributing the opponent's monster is optional (_"This turn you can Tribute that monster"_).
    *   You can Tribute the target for a Tribute Summon, for a Ritual Summon, or as a cost / effect.
    *   You can play 2 “Soul Exchanges” and then Tribute both targets to Summon a Level 7+ monster.
    *   You cannot Tribute the monster targeted by "Soul Exchange" to pay the cost to activate the effect of your "Exiled Force", because "Exiled Force" must Tribute itself.
    *   You can Tribute the opponent's face-up Plant-Type monster for "Lonefire Blossom"'s effect.
    *   If the ACTIVATION of "Soul Exchange" is negated (by "Dark Bribe"), the Ⓒ Condition is not applied. You can conduct your Battle Phase this turn.
    *   If the EFFECT of "Soul Exchange" is negated (by "Imperial Order"), the Ⓒ Condition still applies. You cannot conduct your Battle Phase this turn.
*   You cannot activate “Soul Exchange” during your Main Phase 2 because you must skip your Battle Phase.
*   You cannot use “Soul Exchange” for “Polymerization” because “Polymerization” does not use Tribute.
