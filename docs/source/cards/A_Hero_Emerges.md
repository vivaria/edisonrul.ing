# A HERO EMERGES  
> You can only activate this card when your opponent declares an attack. Your opponent selects 1 random card from your hand. If it is a Monster Card, Special Summon it on your side of the field. If not, send it to the Graveyard.

*   You can Special Summon a high-level monster, like "Dark Magician", with "A Hero Emerges". But if your opponent selects a Special Summon-only monster like "Dark Necrofear", or a Spirit Monster, it is sent to the Graveyard.
*   When "Guardian Elma" is selected for "A Hero Emerges", and you have "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" on your side of the field, you can Special Summon her, but if you don't have it, then she is sent to the Graveyard.
*   You can activate "A Hero Emerges" even if you have only 1 card in your hand.
