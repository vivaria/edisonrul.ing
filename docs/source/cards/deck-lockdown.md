# DECK LOCKDOWN

*   Destroying "Deck Lockdown" during the Standby Phase does not start a Chain.
*   Monsters can be Special Summoned from the Extra Deck while “Deck Lockdown” is active.
*   "Reinforcement of the Army", the effect of "Green Gadget", etc. cannot be activated while "Deck Lockdown" is active.
*   If "Sangan" is sent from the field to the Graveyard while "Deck Lockdown" is active, its effect will start a Chain but its effect will disappear when it resolves.
*   "Crystal Seer"'s effect can activate while "Deck Lockdown" is active, but the card you would add to your hand is sent to the Graveyard instead.
