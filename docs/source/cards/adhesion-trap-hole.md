# Adhesion Trap Hole

> Activate only when your opponent Summons a monster(s). While that monster(s) is face-up on the field, its original ATK is halved.

*   "Adhesion Trap Hole" works against "a monster or monsters", so "Adhesion Trap Hole" does NOT target.
*   When "Cyber Jar" is activated, you may use "Adhesion Trap Hole" against all monsters your opponent Special Summons in face-up Attack Position, but "Adhesion Trap Hole" has no effect on any monsters your opponent Special Summons face-down.
*   "Adhesion Trap Hole" cannot affect monsters Special Summoned face-down with "The Shallow Grave", "Morphing Jar #2", etc.
*   If a monster affected by "Adhesion Trap Hole" is flipped face-down (with "Book of Moon", etc.), "Adhesion Trap Hole"'s effect disappears and the monster's ATK is back to normal.
*   "Adhesion Trap Hole" halves the original ATK, so if you activate another effect that alters ATK, halve the original ATK first and then resolve the other ATK-modifying effect.
*   If a monster affected by "Adhesion Trap Hole" is then equipped with "Megamorph", only "Megamorph"'s effect applies.
