# ANCIENT GEAR DRILL

> Activate only while you control a face-up "Ancient Gear" monster. Discard 1 card from your hand. Select 1 Spell Card from your Deck and Set it. You cannot use that Spell Card this turn.

*   Discarding 1 card is a cost.
*   You must show your chosen card to your opponent to verify that it is a Spell Card.
*   You can select a Field Spell Card but you must Set it in your Field Card Zone.
*   “You cannot use that Spell Card this turn” means that you cannot activate it, and you cannot use it to pay a cost for Summoning “Anteatereatingant” or for the effect of a card like “Emergency Provisions” or “Elemental Hero Tempest”.
*   If you get a Spell Card with “Ancient Gear Drill” and then return it to your hand with “Giant Trunade”, restrictions no longer apply so you can use it as normal.
