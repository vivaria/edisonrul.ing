# Greed Quasar

*   The Level of “Greed Quasar” increases at the same timing that monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the Graveyard.
*   This card cannot be searched from the Deck by cards like “Sangan” that search based on ATK/DEF. If “Greed Quasar” is flipped face-down, its effect is reset and any increased Levels are lost. If “Skill Drain” is activated, “Greed Quasar” loses any extra Levels it has. Even if “Skill Drain” is destroyed, the extra Levels remain lost.
