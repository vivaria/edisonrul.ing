# TWIN-SHIELD DEFENDER

*   "Twin-Shield Defender"'s effect targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.
*   "Twin-Shield Defender" halves the current ATK of the targeted monster, including any gains and/or losses from effects.
    *   Example 1: "Sangan" equipped with "Axe of Despair" has 2000 ATK. If its ATK is halved by "Twin-Shield Defender" it will have 1000 ATK.
    *   Example 2: "Sangan"'s original ATK is halved by "Shrink" to 500 ATK. If its ATK is halved by "Twin-Shield Defender", it will have 250 ATK.
*   If "Rush Recklessly" is activated after "Twin-Shield Defender"'s effect resolves, the ATK gained from "Rush Recklessly" is not halved.
*   If "Shrink" or "Megamorph" is activated after "Twin-Shield Defender"'s effect resolves, "Twin-Shield Defender"'s effect disappears.
    *   Example 1: If "Sangan"'s ATK is halved by "Twin-Shield Defender" to 500 ATK and afterwards its original ATK is halved by "Shrink", it will have 500 ATK.
    *   Example 2: If "Sangan"'s ATK is halved by "Twin-Shield Defender" to 500 ATK and afterwards it is equipped with "Megamorph", it will have 500 ATK or 2000 ATK (depending on Life Points).
