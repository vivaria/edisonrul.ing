# Hand Of The Six Samurai

> ① While you control another "Six Samurai" monster, you can Tribute 1 "Six Samurai" monster to destroy 1 monster on the field.

*   The ① Ignition Effect targets 1 monster on the field.
    *   Tributing 1 "Six Samurai" monster (including this card) you control is a cost. If "Soul Exchange" targets your opponent's "Six Samurai" monster, you can Tribute it as cost instead.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down, it is still destroyed.
