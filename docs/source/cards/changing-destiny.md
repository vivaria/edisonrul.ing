# CHANGING DESTINY

*   This targets the opponent’s attacking monster.
*   If you can’t change your opponent’s monster to Defense Position, you can’t apply the rest of the effect.
*   If “Total Defense Shogun” attacks while in Defense Position, you can activate “Changing Destiny.”
    *   The attack will be negated, but the rest of the effect will not be applied. Changing the monster to Defense Position and gaining Life Points or inflicting damage do not happen at the same time.
*   Your opponent chooses which effect to apply after their monster is changed to Defense Position.
