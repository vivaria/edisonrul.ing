# DUPE FROG

> ① This card's name is treated as "Des Frog" while it is face-up on the field. ② Your opponent cannot select another monster as an attack target. ③ When this card is sent from the field to the Graveyard, you can add 1 "Frog" monster except "Dupe Frog" or "Frog the Jam" from your Deck or Graveyard to your hand.

*   The ① Continuous Effect causes "Dupe Frog" to be counted towards the effect of "Des Croaking".
*   The ② Continuous Effect applies while face-up on the field. It can be negated by "Skill Drain".
    *   If 2+ copies of "Dupe Frog" are face-up on your field, your opponent cannot attack your monsters, but they can still attack directly (with "Drill Warrior").
*   The ③ optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect does not target a card in the Graveyard. It is not negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   This "_When... you can_..." effect can miss the timing.
    *   This effect will NOT activate if "Dupe Frog" was Tributed for a cost or a Tribute Summon.
    *   This effect will NOT activate if "Dupe Frog" was used as Fusion or Synchro Material.
    *   This effect will NOT activate if "Dupe Frog" was sent to the Graveyard as Chain Link 2(+).
    *   This effect WILL activate if "Dupe Frog" is destroyed by Battle and sent to the Graveyard.
    *   This effect WILL activate if "Dupe Frog" is sent to the Graveyard as the last part of Chain Link 1.
