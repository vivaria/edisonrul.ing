# ACID TRAP HOLE

> Select 1 face-down Defense Position monster. Flip it face-up, and if the DEF of the monster is 2000 points or less, destroy the monster. If the DEF is more than 2000 points, return the monster to face-down Defense Position.

*   A face-down "Jinzo" will be destroyed by this card.
*   If the monster flipped face-up has an effect that changes its DEF, such as "Enraged Muka Muka", calculate the current DEF, then determine if it will be destroyed or flipped back face-down. So if you had 4 cards in your hand, "Enraged Muka Muka" would not be destroyed.
*   If the targeted monster has a Flip Effect, that Effect is activated whether the DEF is greater than 2000 or not. If the DEF of the selected monster is 2000 or less, such as a "Hane-Hane", it can not select itself for its Flip Effect since it is destroyed.
