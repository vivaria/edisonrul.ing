> ① When this card destroys a monster by battle and sends it to the Graveyard, gain Life Points equal to that monster's original ATK. ② You can pay 1000 Life Points to negate the activation of a Spell or Trap Card that targets 1 Psychic-Type monster, and destroy it.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   The Life Point gain is determined using the destroyed monster's original (printed) ATK, where "?" is treated as 0 ATK.
*   The ② Quick Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This negates the activation (playing face-up) of a Spell / Trap Card, even in the Damage Step.
    *   This cannot negate the activation of Spell Card Effects (ex: "Blaze Accelerator").
    *   The targeted Psychic-Type can be on the field / in the Graveyard / removed from play.
    *   This cannot negate the activation of a Spell / Trap Card that targets more than 1 Psychic-Type, or that simply does not target \[[REF](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Forum:Icarus_Attack_vs._Thought_Ruler)\].
