*   If you have both “Ogre of the Scarlet Sorrow” and “Battle Fader” in your hand when your opponent declares their second direct attack, you can only activate the effect of one of them.
*   If you have two “Ogre of the Scarlet Sorrow” in your hand when your opponent declares their second direct attack, you can only activate the effect of one of them.
*   If “Skill Drain” is activated, the ATK/DEF of “Ogre of the Scarlet Sorrow” will become 0 and remain 0 even if “Skill Drain” is later destroyed.
