# SLIP SUMMON

*   This effect does not target. You cannot activate this card during the Damage Step.
*   If you use “Slip Summon” to Special Summon a monster like “Elemental Hero Wildheart” that is unaffected by Traps, it will remain on the field and not be returned to the owner’s hand during the End Phase.
*   The effect that returns the Summoned monster to its owner’s hand during the End Phase does not start a Chain.
