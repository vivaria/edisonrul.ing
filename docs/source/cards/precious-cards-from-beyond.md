*   If you have multiple "Precious Cards from Beyond", you can activate each of their effects when you Tribute Summon or Set with 2 or more Tributes.
*   If you Tribute Summon or Set with 2 monsters, and 1 of them was your opponent's monster that you used with "Change of Heart" or "Soul Exchange", you can activate "Precious Cards from Beyond".
