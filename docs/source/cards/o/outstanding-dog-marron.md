### Card Rulings

*   When Outstanding Dog Marron is sent to the GY during a chain, its effect is activated after the current chain resolves (just like Witch of the Black Forest).
*   When Mystical Knight of Jackal attacks Outstanding Dog Marron and destroys it, the effects are simultaneous. So Mystical Knight of Jackal's effect is Step 1 of a chain and Outstanding Dog Marron is Step 2. Outstanding Dog Marron is returned to the Deck and Mystical Knight of Jackal's effect disappears.
