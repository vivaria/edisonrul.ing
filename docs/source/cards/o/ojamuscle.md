# Ojamuscle

*   This card’s effect lasts for as long as the selected “Ojama King” remains face-up on the field.
*   This card targets 1 face-up “Ojama King”. If “Book of Moon” is chained to flip the targeted “Ojama King” face-down all the other “Ojama” monsters are destroyed, but no ATK increase is given.
*   “Ojamuscle” is considered to be an “Ojama” card, so you can send it from your hand to the Graveyard for the cost of the first effect. If you control “Ojamuscle” and it is a monster (for example, with “Magical Hats”), it is considered an “Ojama” monster for the second effect.
