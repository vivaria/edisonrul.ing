    *   VS. "Sangan" & "Ultimate Offering": If "Ultimate Offering" Tributes Sangan (and 2 monsters) to Normal Summon Obelisk as Chain Link 1, "Sangan" cannot activate its effect, since it would activate in the Summon response timing of Obelisk. If instead Obelisk is Summoned as Chain Link 2+, then "Sangan" can activate in a new Chain once the current one resolves completely
    *   When Obelisk is successfully Summoned, nothing can be done. Afterwards, the Turn Player enters an open game state and may Synchro Summon, Set a Spell / Trap Card, etc.
    *   This effect does not apply if Obelisk was Special Summoned.
*   The ② Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   Cards / Effects cannot target this card. If Obelisk is the only available target, they cannot be activated (ex: "Dimensional Prison", "Blaze Accelerator", "Dark Armed Dragon").
    *   Cards / Effects that do not target (ex: "Mirror Force", "Book of Eclipse") still affect Obelisk.
*   The ③ Trigger Effect activates once each End Phase while Obelisk remains face-up.
    *   This effect does not target Obelisk.
    *   If an effect is Chained that flipped Obelisk face-down, it is still sent to the Graveyard.
*   The ④ Ignition effect also has a condition attached that prevents Obelisk from attacking.
    *   Tributing two monsters is a cost.
    *   "Obelisk the Tormentor" may Tribute itself to activate its effect.
    *   If this activated effect was negated (by "Starlight Road"), the (4C) Condition will still apply.
    *   If the activation of this effect was negated (by "Divine Wrath"), the (4C) Condition does not apply.
