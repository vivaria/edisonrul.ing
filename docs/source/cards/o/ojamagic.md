### Card Rulings

*   When you activate this card’s effect, and you find out that you do not have all 3 of “Ojama Green”, “Ojama Yellow”, and “Ojama Black” in your Deck, then you cannot add any of them to your hand. You must add all 3 or none. If you do not add all 3, your opponent may check your Deck to verify.
*   The effect of “Ojamagic” activates in the Graveyard, and it can be chained to. It cannot be negated by “Magic Jammer” or “Dark Balter the Terrible”.
*   Because the effect of “Ojamagic” is mandatory, it will activate even if it is sent to the Graveyard as the cost for another card, or in the middle of a chain.
*   Since a Spell Speed 1 effect cannot be chained to a Spell Speed 2 effect, and “Ojamagic” is a Normal Spell Cards, if “Ojamagic” is sent to the Graveyard simultaneously with a Spell Speed 2 card that activates in the Graveyard, like “Statue of the Wicked” or “Dark Coffin”, then “Ojamagic” is the first chain link, and the Trap Cards will be the second and third chain links.
*   If you select “Ojamagic” for the effect of “Ancient Gear Drill”, and it is destroyed that same turn, you cannot activate “Ojamagic’s” effect.
