# PROOF OF POWERLESSNESS

> Activate only while you control a face-up Level 7 or higher monster. Destroy all face-up Level 5 or lower monsters your opponent controls. Monsters you control cannot attack this turn.
  

*   Your Level 7+ monster only needs to be face-up to activate this card. The effect will resolve even if it is flipped face-down / leaves the field.
*   You can activate this card on your opponent's turn, since you will not be declaring attacks that turn.
*   Monsters like "Elemental Hero Wildheart" can still attack the turn you activate “Proof of Powerlessness.”
