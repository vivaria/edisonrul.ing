# SMASHING GROUND  
> Destroy the 1 face-up monster your opponent controls that has the highest DEF. (If it's a tie, you get to choose.)

*   This effect does NOT target.
*   You can activate "Smashing Ground" even if your opponent only has 1 monster on the field.
*   If there are two or more monsters with equal DEF on your opponent's side of the field, you (the player who activated "Smashing Ground") select which monster will be destroyed.
*   This card can be negated by "My Body as a Shield" because it guarantees an attempt to destroy a monster at resolution.
*   "[Morphtronic Forcefield](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Morphtronic_Forcefield)" cannot negate "Smashing Ground"/"Fissure"/etc, even if you only control "Morphtronic" monsters.
