# GIGANTIC CEPHALOTUS

*   If "Skill Drain" is active, "Gigantic Cephalotus" loses any ATK gained by its effect. The ATK is not regained when "Skill Drain" is negated or removed from the field.
*   The destroyed Plant-Type monster must be a Plant-Type monster both on the field and in the Graveyard, or "Gigantic Cephalotus'" effect is not applied.
