# THE SPELL ABSORBING LIFE

*   The "Spell Absorbing Life" is like "Ceasefire" except it gives you Life Points instead of damaging your opponent.
*   You can activate "The Spell Absorbing Life" as long as there is at least 1 face-down monster on the field, OR there is at least 1 effect monster on the field (or both).
*   If you control "Fire Princess" and activate "The Spell Absorbing Life", "Fire Princess" inflicts 500 damage no matter how many Life Points you gained from "The Spell Absorbing Life".
