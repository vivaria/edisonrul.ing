# BLACKWING - GALE THE WHIRLWIND  
> Ⓢ If you control a “Blackwing” monster other than “Blackwing – Gale the Whirlwind”, you can Special Summon this card from your hand.  
① Once per turn, you can halve the ATK and DEF of 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.

*   This Ⓢ Special Summon does not start a chain.
*   The ① Ignition Effect targets. The target’s ATK is halved so long as it remains face-up on the field.
    *   Non-Continuous Effects (such as Gale's) that halve ATK/DEF calculated by a Continuous Effect (such as "Tragoedia"'s) prevent the Continuous Effect from recalculating. This locks the new ATK/DEF of that monster so long as it is face-up on the field \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/105886-tragoedia-being-summoned-while-black-garden-is-active/&tab=comments#comment-2112568)\].
        *   Example 1: A monster equipped with “United We Stand” whose ATK was halved by Gale WILL NOT have its ATK changed when the number of monsters on the field changes.
        *   Example 2: Gale's effect targets a "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" equipped with "Axe of Despair". Its ATK is reduced to 2000, and will not change even if "Axe of Despair" is destroyed or has its effect negated. This ruling also applies to temporary ATK modifiers (ex: "Rush Recklessly").
