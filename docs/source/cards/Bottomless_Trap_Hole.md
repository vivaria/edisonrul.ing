# BOTTOMLESS TRAP HOLE  
> Activate only when your opponent Summons a monster(s) with 1500 or more ATK. Destroy and remove from play the monster(s).

*   This card can only respond to a Normal / Flip / Special Summon of a monster with 1500(+) ATK.
    *   Only monsters whose current ATK (including ATK changes) is 1500(+) are destroyed.
    *   If a monster(s) is flipped face-down, its ATK cannot be verified and so it is not destroyed.
    *   A destroyed monster(s) is removed from play, it is never sent to the Graveyard \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=930293)\].
    *   This effect does not target. It can remove from play multiple monsters Summoned simultaneously.
    *   Monsters Summoned simultaneously (by "Return from the Different Dimension") with less than 1500 ATK (or that were Special Summoned face-down) are not destroyed / removed from play.
    *   If the opponent activates "Monster Reborn" and chains "Call of the Haunted", "Bottomless Trap Hole" can activate after that Chain resolves, destroying the monster Summoned in Chain Link 1.
*   You cannot activate this card during the Damage Step.
*   You cannot activate this card after "Jinzo" is Summoned.
*   You cannot activate this card if a monster(s) is Normal / Special Summoned as Chain Link 2+.
