# Dark Hunter

*   If you activate "Dark Hunter"'s "5 or more" effect and an effect is chained that reduces the number of DARK monsters in your Graveyard to 4 or less, "Dark Hunter"'s effect still resolves.
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, all of "Dark Hunter"'s effects are negated because the primary effect, "This card's effect changes depending on the number of DARK monsters in your Graveyard", is negated.
