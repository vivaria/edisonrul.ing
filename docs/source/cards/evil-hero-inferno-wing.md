# Evil Hero Inferno Wing

*   The damage inflicted by “Evil Hero Inferno Wing” is determined when the destroyed monster is sent to the Graveyard, and due to this the damage inflicted will be based on the destroyed monsters original ATK or DEF.
*   If the destroyed monster’s ATK and DEF are equal, the effect of “Evil Hero Inferno Wing” will still activate and it will inflict damage equal to either the ATK or DEF. (since both are equal, it does not matter which is selected)
