# ZETA RETICULANT

*   The effect that Special Summons a Token is a Trigger Effect that activates in the Graveyard.
*   The effect of “Zeta Reticulant” to Special Summon itself from your hand has no effect type. Like “Cyber Dragon”, it is merely a procedure to Special Summon.
*   If “Zeta Reticulant” activates in the Graveyard, to Summon an “Eva Token”, and “Disappear” is chained, so that “Zeta Reticulant” is no longer in the Graveyard when its effect resolves, the “Eva Token” is still Summoned.
*   “Zeta Reticulant” will Summon an “Eva Token” even if your opponent’s monster is removed from play face-down.
*   If your Monster Card Zones are full and your opponent’s monster is removed from play, the effect of “Zeta Reticulant” activates but its effect is not applied.
