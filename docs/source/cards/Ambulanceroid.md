# AMBULANCEROID

> ① When a "roid" monster is added from your Graveyard to your hand, you can Special Summon that monster.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   You can Special Summon “Dark Jeroid” with “Ambulanceroid’s” effect because it has “roid” in its card name.
    *   If you add 2 "roid" monsters to your hand with "Expressroid"'s effect while you control this card, you can activate its effect to Special Summon both "roid" monsters.
