# Djinn Presider Of Rituals

*   If “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” copies the name and effect of this card and is used for a Ritual Summon, you will not be able to draw when the Ritual Monster destroys a monster by battle.
*   The effect to draw when the Ritual Monster destroys a monster by battle is applied even if “Skill Drain” is active.
*   If the Ritual Monster Summoned using this card as one of the Tributes battles a monster with the same ATK, you cannot draw with this effect.
*   Even if you remove more than 1 copy of this card for the Ritual Summon of a Ritual Monster you will only draw 1 card each time that Ritual Monster destroys a monster by battle.
*   The effect to draw a card does not start a Chain. It occurs when the monster destroyed by battle is sent to the Graveyard.
*   If the Ritual Monster that was Ritual Summoned using this card is flipped face-down, this card’s effect is no longer applied.
*   If you remove this card from play for the Ritual Summon of “Divine Grace – Northwemko” it counts towards the number of cards you can select for the effect of “Divine Grace – Northwemko.”
