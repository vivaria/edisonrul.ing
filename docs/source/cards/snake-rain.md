*   You cannot activate this card if there are less than 4 Reptile-Type monsters in your Deck.
*   If the number of Reptile-Type monsters in your Deck becomes less than 4 due to an effect chained to “Snake Rain”, you cannot send any Reptile-Type monsters from your Deck to the Graveyard when “Snake Rain” resolves.
