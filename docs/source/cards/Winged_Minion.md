# WINGED MINION

*   If the Fiend-Type monster that received the ATK and DEF increase from this card’s effect is flipped face-down, the effect is reset and the ATK and DEF return to the original amounts.
*   You may Tribute two "Winged Minions" to increase the ATK and DEF of a Fiend-Type monster by 1400 points.
*   If the Fiend-Type monster that was selected for this card’s effect is changed into a different Type, by the effect of "DNA Surgery" for example, it retains the 700 point ATK and DEF increase.
