# Double Tool C&D

> Equip only to a "Power Tool Dragon" or Level 4 or higher Machine-Type "Morphtronic" monster you control. While equipped: ● During your turn: It gains 1000 ATK. If it attacks, any effects of the attack target that activate or apply on the field are negated during that Battle Phase. ● During your opponent's turn: Your opponent cannot select a monster other than the equipped monster as an attack target. An opponent's monster that battles the equipped monster is destroyed at the end of the Damage Step.

*   “Double Tool C&D” can only be equipped to a monster you control. If control shifts to the opponent, “Double Tool C&D” will be destroyed.
*   A monster equipped with “Double Tool C&D” only negates a monster’s effect during your turn while the 2 monsters are battling. This means that it only negates effects that activate on the field, or are continuous effects while on the field.
*   Effects that activate in the Graveyard like “Sangan” are not negated. “Double Tool C&D’s” effect that destroys a monster during the opponent’s turn starts a Chain. If, during your opponent’s turn, the opponent’s monster attacks your monster equipped with “Double Tool C&D,” and is destroyed by battle, the effect of “Double Tool C&D” that would destroy that monster does not activate.
*   If you have two monsters, each equipped with “Double Tool C&D,” your opponent cannot attack.
