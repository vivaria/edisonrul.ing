# BARK OF DARK RULER

> You can only activate this card during the Damage Step of a Battle Phase if a Fiend-Type monster on your side of the field battles. Pay Life Points (in multiples of 100 points) to decrease 1 of your opponent's monster's ATK and DEF by the same amount of points until End Phase of that turn.

*   This card targets your opponent’s monster that is battling your Fiend-Type monster.
*   Paying Life Points for this card is a cost.
*   You cannot pay more Life Points than necessary. This means that if the target monster has ATK 1500 / DEF 1800, the highest amount of Life Points you can pay is 1800. The target monster will then be an ATK 0 / DEF 0. If the target monster has ATK 1850 / DEF 500, the most you can pay is 1800. This is because you have to play in multiples of 100, and paying 1900 would be paying more than necessary. So you may pay 1800 Life Points and the target monster would become an ATK 50 / DEF 0.
