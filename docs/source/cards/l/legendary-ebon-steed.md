# Legendary Ebon Steed

*   This card’s effect to destroy itself does not start a Chain.
*   If you control 2 “Six Samurai” monsters, and 1 of them equipped with “Legendary Ebon Steed” would be destroyed, the effect of “Legendary Ebon Steed” must be used. You cannot choose to destroy another “Six Samurai” monster instead.
*   If you control 2 “Six Samurai” monsters, one equipped with “Legendary Ebon Steed” and one without, and the unequipped monster would be destroyed, you can use its final effect to destroy the equipped “Six Samurai” instead. “Legendary Ebon Steed” will then be destroyed instead of that “Six Samurai”.
*   If you control 2 “Six Samurai” monsters that would be destroyed at the same time, and a third “Six Samurai” monster equipped with “Legendary Ebon Steed”, you can destroy the third “Six Samurai” to save one of the other two. “Legendary Ebon Steed” would be destroyed instead. There is no way to destroy the third “Six Samurai” and destroy “Legendary Ebon Steed” to save the other 2 “Six Samurai”.
*   If multiple copies of “Legendary Ebon Steed” are equipped to the same “Six Samurai” monster and that monster would be destroyed, all of the “Legendary Ebon Steeds” are destroyed.
