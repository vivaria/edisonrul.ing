# Lonefire Blossom

> ① Once per turn, you can Tribute 1 face-up Plant-Type monster to Special Summon 1 Plant-Type monster from your Deck.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Tributing 1 face-up Plant-Type monster is a cost. This card can be Tributed for its own effect.
    *   You cannot activate this effect if you cannot Special Summon a Plant-Type monster from your Deck.
    *   If this card's effect was negated by "Debris Dragon", this effect can activate but resolves negated.
*   VS. "Gozen Match": you can only activate the effect of "Lonefire Blossom" if you have a FIRE Plant-Type monster in your Deck; you cannot activate the effect if you do not have any FIRE Plant-Type monsters in your Deck. However, if Lonefire Tributes itself and afterwards there are no monsters on your field, then when resolving the effect of Lonefire you can choose to Special Summon a WIND monster like "Tytannial, Princess of Camellias".
