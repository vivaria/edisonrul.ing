### Card Rulings

*   Lord of D. can't negate effects; he only prevents Dragon-Type monsters from being selected as targets of effects. Once a target has been selected, the effect of Lord of D. is irrelevant.
*   If your opponent activates Ring of Destruction targeting your Lord of D. and you chain D. Tribe to change Lord of D. to Dragon-Type, Ring of Destruction will still resolve and destroy Lord of D. since he was selected as a target before he was changed into Dragon-Type. If your opponent activates Ring of Destruction targeting a Dragon-Type monster you control and you chain Call of the Haunted to Special Summon Lord of D. from your GY, your Dragon-Type monster is still destroyed for the same reason.
*   If you have Lord of D. on the field, and activate Premature Burial to Special Summon a Dragon-Type monster from your GY, that is okay, but if your opponent later destroys Premature Burial your Dragon-Type monster is also destroyed because Premature Burial is NOT selecting your Dragon-Type as a target.
*   While you have Lord of D. on the field you can't equip your Dragon-Type monsters with Equip Spell Cards, but if you already have a Dragon-Type monster equipped with an Equip Spell Card when you Summon Lord of D., the Equip Spell card is not destroyed or negated, because Lord of D. only prevents Dragon-Type monsters from being selected as a target.
*   Lord of D. won't stop Dark Hole, Mirror Force, Raigeki, Fissure, Smashing Ground, Hammer Shot, or Amazoness Archers, nor will he protect your Dragon-Type monsters from their effects, since these cards affect the whole field and don't select targets.
