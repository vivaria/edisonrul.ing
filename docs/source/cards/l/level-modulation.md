### Card Rulings

*   An “LV” monster that normally Cannot be Special Summoned except by the method in its text Cannot be Special Summoned from the GY with “Level Modulation” unless it has been previously Special Summoned by the correct procedure. The “ignore the Summoning conditions” text allows for these monsters to be Special Summoned only after they have been properly Summoned by their own effect. This applies to “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8”, “Armed Dragon LV7”, “Silent Swordsman LV7”, “Silent Magician LV8”, and “Winged Kuriboh LV10”.
*   You can't activate “Level Modulation” if the opponent has 1 or less card in their Deck, or if you have “Protector of the Sanctuary” on the field.
*   Even Continuous Effects on the Special Summoned Monster, like “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6”, are not applied during the turn this card is used to Special Summon that monster.
*   If the monster Special Summoned by this card’s effect is flipped face-down, then the restrictions of “Level Modulation” are no longer applied. If you flip it face-up again, it can attack and its effects are applied.
