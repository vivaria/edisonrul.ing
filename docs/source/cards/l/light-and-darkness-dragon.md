### Card Text

> Ⓒ This card cannot be Special Summoned. ① While this card is face-up on the field its Attribute is also treated as DARK. ② When a Spell or Trap Card is activated, or the effect of an Effect Monster is activated, that activation is negated and this card loses 500 ATK and DEF. ③ When this card is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, select 1 monster in your Graveyard. Then destroy all cards you control, and Special Summon that monster.

### Card Rulings

*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated.
*   The ① Continuous Effect only applies on the field.
    *   Effects which affect LIGHT or DARK monsters affect this card.
    *   This card is sent to the Graveyard while "Gozen Match" is active.
*   The ② mandatory Quick Effect ALWAYS activates (even if this card has <500 ATK or DEF).
    *   ATK / DEF changes apply so long as this card is face-up on the field.
    *   This effect only activates once per chain, at the earliest opportunity.
    *   This effect can chain to a monster effect activated from any location.
    *   This effect can chain to the activation of a Spell / Trap Card (when it is played face-up).
        *   A Continuous Spell / Trap Card whose activation was negated is sent to the Graveyard.
    *   This effect cannot chain to the activated effect of a Spell / Trap card that is already face-up / in the Graveyard (such as "Blaze Accelerator" or "Skill Successor", or a Normal Spell Card sent to the Graveyard by "Destiny Hero Diamond Dude").
    *   If this card cannot lose 500 ATK and 500 DEF, this effect does not negate anything.
    *   If you control 2 "Light and Darkness Dragon" and a Spell / Trap Card / monster effect is activated, you choose the order in which their effects go on Chain. When the Chain resolves, the "Light and Darkness Dragon" whose effect was Chain Link 3 resolves without effect, since it was not directly Chained to the effect activated as Chain Link 1, and it won't lose ATK or DEF.
    *   VS. "Shrink": This card's original ATK is halved, then apply all previous ATK losses.
    *   VS. "Reverse Trap": this effect can only activate once after "Reverse Trap" resolves. When it does, it will gain 500 ATK and DEF instead of losing 500 ATK and DEF.
*   The ③ mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect activates so long as it is sent to the Graveyard when destroyed, whether it was destroyed in the hand, Deck, on the field, or while equipped to "Relinquished".
    *   This effect activates even if you don't control any cards when this card is destroyed.
    *   This effect targets a monster (if any) in your Graveyard. It is negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   This effect resolves sequentially: destroy all cards you control, then Summon the target \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=492019)\].
        *   Destroy all cards you control, even if the target cannot be Special Summoned.
        *   If "Peten the Dark Clown" you control is destroyed, and then you Special Summon the target, Peten cannot activate its effect \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=492019)\].
*   NOTE: This card received an erratum with [Problem-Solving Card Text](https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?p=4514) in Astral Pack 2 (2013). The TCG rulings were updated, changing the ③ Trigger Effect so that both parts resolved simultaneously. In Edison Format, play with the same rules the OCG used and resolve this effect sequentially.

> Konami policy regarding card legality and cards with [erratas](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Errata) (section IX. subsection G. of the [policy document](https://img.yugioh-card.com/en/gameplay/penalty_guide/YGOTCG_Policy_v_2_1.pdf)) state that "you are required to play all copies of your cards according to the most recent text". Therefore, the language used and the consequences of this erratum are essential to authentic Edison Format play.

### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① Cannot be Special Summoned.
> ② While face-up on the field, this card is also DARK.
> ③ Once per Chain, if a Spell/Trap Card, or Monster Effect is activated (Quick):
> This card loses exactly 500 ATK/DEF and that activation is negated.
> ④ If this card is destroyed and sent to the GY: Target 1 monster in your GY (if possible); destroy all cards you control, also, after that, Special Summon that monster (if any).

### Card Rulings

● For the mandatory ③ effect to resolve, this card must be able to both negate the activation and also lose exactly 500 ATK and 500 DEF. If you can’t do either, you do neither.
● Vs Spirit Monsters, Lyla, Treeborn Frog, Vayu, etc:
These trigger effects will be negated by this card’s ③ effect, and can then trigger again.
(This can “loop” until Light and Darkness Dragon can’t lose any more ATK/DEF.)
● Summoning a monster with the ④ happens after cards are destroyed.
