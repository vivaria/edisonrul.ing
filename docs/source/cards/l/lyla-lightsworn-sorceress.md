### Card Text

> ① You can change this card from face-up Attack Position to face-up Defense Position and destroy 1 Spell or Trap Card your opponent controls. If you activate this effect, this card's battle position cannot be changed until the end of your next turn, except with a card effect. ② During each of your End Phases, send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Ignition effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect targets 1 Spell / Trap Card your opponent controls.
    *   The target is not destroyed if Lyla cannot be changed to Defense Position.
    *   This effect changes Lyla to Defense Position (this is not a cost), even if the target is not destroyed.
    *   This effect can be activated more than once per turn while "Final Attack Orders" applies.
    *   After this effect resolves, if your opponent steals Lyla with "Mind Control", they CANNOT manually change her to Attack Position in order to use this effect \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=872829)\].
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect must resolve (even if the effect is negated) before the turn can end.
    *   If you do not have enough cards to send to the Graveyard remaining in your Deck when resolving this effect, all cards remaining in your Deck are sent to the Graveyard.
    *   If the activation of this effect is negated by "Light and Darkness Dragon", it will activate again in the same End Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
    *   If this effect resolves negated by "Skill Drain", it will not activate again in the same End Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
    *   The "Lightsworn" monster (or "Judgment Dragon") must remain face-up on the field in order to activate and resolve this effect.
    *   If your opponent activates "Book of Eclipse" after you resolve this effect, when "Book of Eclipse" resolves and your affected monsters are flipped face-up (and you draw 1 card for each) then each "Lightsworn" monster (or "Judgment Dragon") will once again activate this effect \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=678963)\]
*   ② VS. "Brain Control": Player A gains control of Player B's "Lightsworn" monster until the End Phase. During the End Phase, Player A may decide in which order to activate/resolve effects:
    1.  Player A resolves "Brain Control" first, restoring control of the "Lightsworn" monster to Player B. That "Lightsworn" monster is no longer controlled by the turn player, thus its effect will not activate.
    2.  Player A activates and resolves the "Lightsworn" monster's effect to send cards from the top of their Deck to the Graveyard. Then that "Lightsworn" monster is returned to Player B's control \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=653322)\].
*   ② VS. "Enemy Controller":
    *   During Player A's turn, Player B gains control of Player A's "Lightsworn" monster. During the End Phase, when control of the "Lightsworn" monster is restored to Player A, its mandatory Trigger Effect will activate \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/85182-judgment-dragon-and-enemy-controller/)\].

### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① You can target 1 Spell/Trap your opponent controls; change this card from Attack Position to face-up Defense Position, and if you do, destroy that target, also, if this card was changed to Defense Position by this effect, it's battle position cannot be changed until the end of your next turn.
> ② During your End Phase: Send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the GY. (Activate & Resolve only if face-up on the field).

### Card Rulings

About the ① effect:
● Like all "and if you do" effects, the first part (changing this card to defense) must happen in order for the second part (destroying that target) to happen.
You can read more about conjunctions here: https://edisonformat.net/rules/compendium/conjunctions.

● If an effect is chained to this effect that switches this card to Defense Position, the effect will not be applied so this card's battle position may still be changed (e.g. vs "Book of Moon" or "Enemy Controler").

● If this card is switched to Defense Position by this effect, but cannot destroy the targeted Spell/Trap (e.g. if it no longer exists on the field), this card's battle position still cannot be changed until the end of your next turn.

● "this card's battle position can't be changed until the end of your next turn" affects Lyla, not her Controller. If you take control of a Lyla with this effect applied, she still can't change her Battle Position.

About the ② effect:
● If you control multiple “Lightsworn” monsters, their End Phase effects don’t chain to each other (they each activate, one after another).
