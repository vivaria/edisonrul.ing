# NEO-SPACIAN AQUA DOLPHIN

*   This effect does not target.
*   When this effect resolves you look at your opponent’s hand. If there are no Monster Cards, do nothing. If the opponent does have a Monster Card, and you have a monster on the field with greater or equal ATK, you will destroy the opponent’s Monster Card and inflict the 500 damage at the same time.
*   If the selected Monster Card in your opponent’s hand has ATK ?, since it is undetermined, you cannot control a monster with greater or equal ATK, and you will take 500 damage.
