# ARCANA FORCE XXI - THE WORLD  
> ① When this card is Summoned, toss a coin: ● Heads: During your End Phase, you can send 2 monsters you control to the Graveyard to skip your opponent's next turn. ● Tails: During your opponent's Draw Phase, add the top card of their Graveyard to their hand.

*   The ① Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   When this effect resolves, this card gains the corresponding Effect. The corresponding effect can be negated by "Skill Drain", but this card will not forget which effect is gained while face-up.
*   The (HEADS) Trigger Effect is optional, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Sending 2 monsters you control to the Graveyard is a cost, you can send "Arcana Force XXI - The World" as one of those monsters.
    *   This effect cannot activate while "Macro Cosmos", since you can't pay the cost.
*   The (TAILS) Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect does NOT target a card in your opponent's Graveyard \[[REF](https://db.ygorganization.com/card#7589)\].
    *   If the activation of this effect is negated (by "Light and Darkness Dragon"), this effect will activate again until it resolves (even if it resolves without effect due to "Skill Drain").
