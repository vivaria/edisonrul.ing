# BUSTER RANCHER

*   If the equipped monster’s ATK is raised above 1000 points, by any effect other than "Buster Rancher"’s own effect, "Buster Rancher" is destroyed.
*   You can equip 2 copies of "Buster Rancher" to the same monster but because of "Buster Rancher"’s effect, when you increase the ATK by 1 "Buster Rancher" effect, the other "Buster Rancher" is destroyed.
*   If "Injection Fairy Lily" is equipped with "Buster Rancher", and you use her effect to increase her ATK, "Buster Rancher" is destroyed. If "Injection Fairy Lily" battles a monster equipped with "Buster Rancher", and her effect is used to increase her ATK, then "Buster Rancher"’s effect activates and increases the ATK of the other monster.
