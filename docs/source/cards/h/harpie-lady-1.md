### Card Rulings

*   The name of "Harpie Lady 1", "Harpie Lady 2", and "Harpie Lady 3" is treated as "Harpie Lady" for all purposes, including Deck construction. So you can have 2 copies of "Harpie Lady 1" in your Deck and 1 copy of "Harpie Lady 2", but not 2 copies of each because you would have 4 cards in your Deck treated as "Harpie Lady". This restriction also applies to your Side Deck, so if you have 3 monsters treated as "Harpie Lady" in your Deck, you cannot have any in your Side Deck.
*   The effect of "Harpie Lady 1" will increase the ATK of your opponent’s WIND monsters too.
