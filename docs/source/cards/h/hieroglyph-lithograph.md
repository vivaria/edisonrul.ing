# Hieroglyph Lithograph

*   "Hieroglyph Lithograph" does not remain on the field like "Swords of Revealing Light".
*   The effect of "Hieroglyph Lithograph" cannot be negated by "Imperial Order" after "Hieroglyph Lithograph" has resolved. You can, of course, chain "Imperial Order" to the activation of "Hieroglyph Lithograph" to negate the effect.
*   When "Infinite Cards" and "Hieroglyph Lithograph" are both in effect, there is no limit to the number of cards for your hand.
