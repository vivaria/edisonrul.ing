# Hyper Hammerhead

*   "Hyper Hammerhead"'s effect activates at the time that a monster would be sent to the Graveyard.
*   Even if "Hyper Hammerhead" was destroyed, its effect resolves.
*   The effect of "Hyper Hammerhead" can be chained to.
*   If you have another effect that activates at the end of the Damage Step, you can place it on a chain with "Hyper Hammerhead"'s effect (such as "Hyper Hammerhead" vs. "Hyper Hammerhead").
