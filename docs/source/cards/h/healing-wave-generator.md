# Healing Wave Generator

*   "Healing Wave Generator"'s effect targets 1 other monster you control.
*   If an effect is chained that removes the targeted monster from the field or flips it face-down, "Healing Wave Generator"'s effect disappears.
*   If an effect is chained that shifts control of the targeted monster to your opponent, you will still gain Life Points.
