# ENCHANTING FITTING ROOM

*   If you have no vacant monster zones, you cannot Special Summon with "Enchanting Fitting Room". So the Level 3 or lower Normal Monsters that would be Special Summoned are sent to the Graveyard instead. All other cards are still returned to the Deck and it is shuffled.
*   If you have some vacant Monster Card Zones, but not enough, select the monsters you wish to Summon with "Enchanting Fitting Room" and Special Summon them.
