### Card Rulings

*   If you have a face-down Field Spell Card, but no face-down cards in your Spell & Trap Card Zones, you can't attack directly with “Elemental Hero Mariner’s” effect.
*   If you control “Relinquished” equipped with a face-down Monster Card, that card is face-down in your Spell & Trap Card Zone, so “Elemental Hero Mariner” can attack directly.
*   If your only face-down card is “Rush Recklessly”, you can attack directly, and then during the DAMAGE STEP, activate “Rush Recklessly” and the direct attack will continue. This is because Replays don't usually occur during the Damage Step.
*   If your opponent controls a monster equipped with “Ring of Magnetism”, then “Elemental Hero Mariner” can't attack directly.
