# Elemental Hero Absolute Zero

## Edisonformat.com (Historical, Pre-UTW Rulings)

1 "Elemental Hero", "Destiny Hero", or "Evil Hero" monster + 1 WATER monster
_Ⓒ This monster cannot be Special Summoned except by Fusion Summon. ① This card gains 500 ATK for each face-up WATER monster on the field, except "Elemental Hero Absolute Zero". ② When this card is removed from the field, destroy all monsters your opponent controls._

*   Fusion Material cannot include "Hero Kid", as it is neither a HERO monster nor a WATER monster.
*   The Ⓒ Condition restricts how this card can be Special Summoned.
    *   This card CANNOT be Special Summoned from the Graveyard / removed from play.
    *   This card CANNOT be Special Summoned from the Extra Deck by "[Summoner of Illusions](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Summoner_of_Illusions)".
*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   This effect does not apply if your other WATER monster is named "Elemental Hero Absolute Zero".
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect is activated by the owner of "Elemental HeroAbsolute Zero".
    *   ACTIVATES IF: this face-up card leaves the field (even under your opponent's control), even if it was returned to the Extra Deck.
    *   DOES NOT ACTIVATE IF: this face-down card leaves the field \[[1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=16793215&postcount=8), [2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=17349868&postcount=8), [3](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=19072708&postcount=12)\].
*   VS. "Starlight Road":
    *   If Absolute Zero's effect activated in the Graveyard / banished, "Starlight Road" can negate its effect but cannot destroy it. Thus, "Stardust Dragon" cannot be Special Summoned.
    *   If Absolute Zero's effect activated in the Extra Deck, "Starlight Road" can negate its effect and destroy it (sending it to the Graveyard), and "Stardust Dragon" can be Special Summoned.
*   VS. "De-Fusion":
    *   If "Elemental Hero Prisma" used its effect to change its name to "Elemental Hero Neos" and was used alongside a WATER monster to Fusion Summon Absolute Zero, you can still Special Summon that same "Elemental Hero Prisma" when "De-Fusion" resolves and returns Elemental HeroAbsolute Zero to the Extra Deck, even though it was being treated as "Elemental Hero Neos" at the time of the Fusion Summon.

### Card Rulings

*   The ② effect will trigger even if it is returned to the Extra Deck or banished.
*   "Starlight Road" can be chained to the ② effect as long as you control at least 2 monsters.
(However, Stardust will only be summoned if this effect is being activated while in the Extra Deck).
*   The ② effect won't trigger if it was face-down when removed from the field.
(If it was attacked while face-down, it is flipped face-up, and does activate when destroyed by battle).
*   If this card is tributed to Tribute Summon a monster with a Trigger effect (i.e. any Monarch), the ② effect must be Chain Link 1.
