### Card Rulings

*   If a FIRE and a WIND monster are on the field, you get both effects.
*   If there are 2 FIRE monsters on the field, Element Dragon’s ATK is 2000 (it only gets the +500 ATK bonus once, no matter how many FIRE monsters are on the field).
*   If there is only 1 WIND monster on the field, and you attack and destroy it with Element Dragon, you can't attack again because there is no longer a WIND monster on the field so Element Dragon no longer has that ability.
*   Monsters that have their Attribute changed with DNA Transplant or Scroll of Bewitchment are included for Element Dragon’s effect.
*   If there are no face-up FIRE monsters on the field, and Element Dragon attacks a face-down FIRE monster, Element Dragon’s effect that increases its ATK by 500 points is applied before damage calculation because it is a Continuous Effect.
