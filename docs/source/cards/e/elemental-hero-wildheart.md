### Card Rulings

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   Apply this effect while Wildheart is face-up; not in the hand / Deck / Graveyard / removed from play.
    *   This card can still be targeted by the effects of Trap Cards, but is unaffected by their effects.
    *   This card is not destroyed by “Call of the Haunted”.
    *   This card is not removed from play by “Return from the Different Dimension”.
    *   This card inflicts no Battle Damage while "Waboku" applies (it affects the Damage, not Wildheart).
    *   VS. “Skill Drain”: whichever effect was active on the field first takes precedence. So if “Elemental Hero Wildheart” is on the field and “Skill Drain” is activated, his effect is not negated. But if “Skill Drain” is on the field and “Elemental Hero Wildheart” is Summoned, his effect is negated by “Skill Drain” as long as “Skill Drain” remains on the field.
