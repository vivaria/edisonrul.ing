# Edge Hammer

*   This card targets 1 opponent's monster.
*   If you destroy a monster whose original ATK is undefined, like "King of the Skull Servants", this card will not inflict any damage to the opponent.
*   If an effect like "Enemy Controller" is chained to "Edge Hammer" and control of the targeted monster switches, it will not be destroyed by "Edge Hammer".
