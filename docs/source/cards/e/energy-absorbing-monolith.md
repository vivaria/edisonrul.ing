*   If you activate “Energy-Absorbing Monolith” while your opponent has “Bad Reaction to Simoichi” face-up on their side of the field, instead of gaining Life Points you will receive damage due to the effect of “Bad Reaction to Simochi”.
*   If you chain “Energy-Absorbing Monolith” to “Ring of Destruction”, when the monster is destroyed you will gain Life Points equal to the destroyed monster’s ATK and your opponent will receive damage equal to the destroyed monster’s ATK.
