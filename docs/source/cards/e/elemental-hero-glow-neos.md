### Card Rulings

*   This card’s final effect is an Ignition Effect. It targets 1 card controlled by the opponent.
*   If you target a Token Monster with this effect, the additional effect (“This card can't battle this turn.”) is not applied because the Token is not treated as a monster after it is destroyed.
*   If you destroy a monster that is being treated as an Equip Spell Card by the effect of “Relinquished”, it is treated as a monster after it is destroyed so the additional effect for destroying a Monster Card is applied.
*   If you destroy “Embodiment of Apophis”, it is treated as a Trap Card after it is destroyed, so the additional effect for destroying a Trap Card is applied.
