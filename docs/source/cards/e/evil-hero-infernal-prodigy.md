### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① If you control no monsters, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand) in Attack Position.
> ② Once per turn, during the End Phase, if this card is in your GY or banishment because it was tributed to Tribute Summon a "HERO" monster face-up this turn (even if it was banished after being sent to the GY but not vice-versa): Draw 1 card.

### Card Rulings

*   This card's Summon does not start a chain, so "Thunder King Rai-Oh" can negate it.

The ② won't activate if:
*   The Tribute Summon was negated (eg by Solemn Judgment).
*   Prodigy was Tributed to Tribute Set a HERO monster.
*   Prodigy is not in the GY or Banished during the End Phase.
*   Prodigy was Tributed this turn, and is banished, but was then returned to the GY.

The ② will activate even if:
*   Prodigy was Tributed and sent to the GY, and was then banished from the GY.
*   Prodigy was Tributed while "Macro Cosmos" was applying.
*   The Tribute Summoned monster left the field before the EP.
