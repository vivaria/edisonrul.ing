# Elemental Hero Stratos

> ① When this card is Normal or Special Summoned, you can select and activate 1 of these effects:
Ⓐ Destroy Spell or Trap Cards on the field up to the number of "Elemental Hero", "Destiny Hero" and "Evil Hero" monsters you control (not counting this card).  
Ⓑ Select and add 1 "Elemental Hero", "Destiny Hero" or "Evil Hero" from your Deck to your hand.

*   The ① optional "_When... you can..._" Trigger Effect (both Ⓐ and Ⓑ) can miss the timing.

    *   This effect CANNOT be activated if Stratos is the only "HERO" monster you control.
    *   Your other face-up "Elemental / Destiny / Evil Hero" monsters are counted when this effect resolves.
    *   This effect does not count "Hero Kid" towards your face up HERO monsters.
*   The Ⓑ effect CANNOT be activated while "Thunder King Rai-Oh" is face-up on the field.
    *   This effect cannot add "Hero Kid".
