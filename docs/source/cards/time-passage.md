# TIME PASSAGE

*   This card targets 1 “Fortune Lady” monster you control.
*   You cannot activate it during the Damage Step.
*   If you activate “Time Passage” targeting your Level 5 “Fortune Lady Dark” and then reduce its Level by 3 for the effect of “Solitaire Magician,” its Level will become 2 during the End Phase (5 + 3 – 3 – 3 = 2)
