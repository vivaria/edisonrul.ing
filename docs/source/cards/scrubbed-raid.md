# SCRUBBED RAID

*   Sending one other card you control to the Graveyard is a cost to activate the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" which ends the Battle Phase.
*   You can neither activate "Scrubbed Raid" nor activate the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" during the Damage Step.
*   You can activate a Spell or Trap Card as Chain Link 1 and then activate the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" in Chain to the card by sending the activated card to the Graveyard. If the activated card was a Normal Spell Card or a Normal Trap Card, then the effect of the card will resolve properly. If the activated card was an Equip, Continuous, or Field Spell Card or a Continuous Trap Card, then the other card is not on the field when resolving its effect, so the effect of the other card is not applied.
*   If you would activate a Set "Scrubbed Raid", then you can also send one card you control to the Graveyard to also simultaneously activate its effect to end the Battle Phase.
*   You cannot activate the effect of a face-up "Scrubbed Raid" multiple times in the same Chain.
*   You can activate the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" during your own Battle Phase's Start Step or Battle Step, but you cannot activate the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" during the Damage Step or End Step. Also, if you are only activating a Set "Scrubbed Raid" to make it face-up on the field, then you can activate "Scrubbed Raid" during the End Step.
*   If the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" is activated when a monster declares an attack, then the Battle Phase ends, so the attacking monster can no longer be treated as an "attacking monster".
*   If the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" is activated in Chain to an effect like "Dimensional Prison", then the effect of "Dimensional Prison" is not applied, and the attacking monster remains on the field.
*   If the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" is activated in Chain to "Magic Cylinder", then the Battle Phase ends",Magic Cylinder" cannot negate the attack so the effect of inflicting damage equal to the monster's ATK is not applied.
*   The effect of "Mirror Force" only destroys all monsters in Attack Position, so all Attack Position monsters will still be destroyed even if the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" ends the Battle Phase.
