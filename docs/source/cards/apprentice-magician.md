# Apprentice Magician

> ① When this card is Summoned, place 1 Spell Counter on a face-up card that you can place a Spell Counter on. ② When this card is destroyed by battle, you can Special Summon 1 Level 2 or lower Spellcaster-Type monster from your Deck in face-down Defense Position.

*   The ① Trigger Effect is mandatory. It activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates whenever this card is (Normal / Flip / Special) Summoned face-up.
    *   If you Special Summon "Apprentice Magician" face-down (such as with "Apprentice Magician’s” effect) then you do not place a Spell Counter.
    *   For effects that place a Spell Counter, you can chain to the activation of those effects. The Spell Counter is actually placed when the effect resolves.
*   The ② Trigger Effect is optional. It activates & resolves in the Graveyard (or banished).
    *   You must show your opponent the monster you Special Summon.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   “Apprentice Magician’s” effect activates at the same time as when monsters are sent to the Graveyard. But it does not have to be sent to the Graveyard; you get to Special Summon a new monster when "Apprentice Magician" is destroyed as a result of battle, even if "Banisher of the Light" is in play.
    *   If you take control of your opponent's "Apprentice Magician", and it is destroyed as a result of battle, then your opponent (the original owner) will get to Special Summon. Because “Apprentice Magician” is no longer on your side of the field, it is now in the opponent’s Graveyard / banished.
