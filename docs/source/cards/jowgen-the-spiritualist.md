# JOWGEN THE SPIRITUALIST

*   When playing with this card you need to remember which monsters on the field were Special Summoned because they can later be destroyed with the effect of "Jowgen the Spiritualist". If a monster that was Special Summoned is flipped face-down, it can still be destroyed by the effect of "Jowgen the Spiritualist".
*   While this card is on the field neither player can activate "Scapegoat", "Monster Reborn", "Call of the Haunted", "Magical Hats", "Dedication through Light and Darkness", or any other card that Special Summons a monster.
*   If "Jowgen the Spiritualist" is Special Summoned by the effect of "Cyber Jar", all monsters that are Special Summoned by that "Cyber Jar" are Summoned successfully.
