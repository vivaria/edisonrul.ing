# SHADOW-IMPRISONING MIRROR

> When the effect of a DARK monster activates on the field or in the Graveyard, negate it.

*   When determining if a monster’s effect should be negated by “Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror”, check the monster’s Attribute at the time its effect is resolved.
*   When a Non-DARK monster’s effect is activated while the monster and “Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror” are both face-up on the field, if you chain “DNA Transplant” and select “DARK”, the monster’s effect will be negated if the monster is still face-up on the field when its effect resolves because it is now a DARK monster.
*   “Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror” cannot negate Unclassified or Continuous Effects of DARK monsters.
