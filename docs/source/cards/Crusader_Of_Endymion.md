# CRUSADER OF ENDYMION

*   The effect to increase this card’s ATK is resolved only if you place a Spell Counter.
*   This effect targets the card you place a Spell Counter on.
*   You cannot place a Spell Counter on this card. If “Skill Drain” is activated, this card loses any ATK gained from its own effect.
*   If a card like “Breaker the Magical Warrior” is having its effect negated, you cannot place a Spell Counter on it with this effect.
*   If the target of this effect is face-down when the effect resolves, no Spell Counter is placed and no ATK is gained.
