# FAIRY WIND

*   Fairy Wind does not destroy itself. Both parts of the effect are performed at the same time.
*   You can still activate “Fairy Wind” even if the only face-up Spell and Trap Cards on the field cannot be destroyed.
*   You cannot activate “Fairy Wind” unless there is at least 1 other Spell and Trap Card on the field.
*   Both players still take damage for each destroyed card even if some of the face-up Spell and Trap Cards are not destroyed. Both players take damage for all the cards destroyed, not just the ones they control.
*   If “Heavy Storm” or “Giant Trunade” is activated, you cannot activate “Fairy Wind” unless there is another face-up Spell or Trap Card other than “Heavy Storm” or “Giant Trunade.”
