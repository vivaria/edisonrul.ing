# SUMMON LIMIT  
> Neither player can Summon more than two times per turn.

*   The Continuous-like Effect does not activate.
    *   This effect counts all Summon events performed during the turn. (ex: "Scapegoat" is only 1 Summon event, since the 4 monsters are Summoned simultaneously).
    *   The limit applies to Normal / Flip / Tribute / Special Summons.
    *   Summons performed before "Summon Limit" resolved are counted towards the limit. After "Summon Limit" resolves, a player that already Summoned twice cannot Summon any more monsters this turn.
    *   A negated Summon (ex: "Chaos Sorcerer") still counts towards the limit.
    *   An Effect (ex: "Debris Dragon") that is negated (by "Skill Drain") still counts towards the limit.
    *   An Effect (ex: "Instant Fusion") whose activation is negated (by "Dark Bribe") does not count towards the limit.
