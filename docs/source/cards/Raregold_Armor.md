# RAREGOLD ARMOR

*   "Raregold Armor" & "Metalsilver Armor" only apply their effects when the same player controls the Equip Spell Card and the monster it is equipped to; you can equip these cards to a monster controlled by your opponent but the effect is not active.
*   If you have 2 monsters equipped with "Raregold Armor", then your opponent cannot attack.
*   If you have a Warrior-Type monster equipped with "Raregold Armor", and "Marauding Captain", your opponent cannot attack.
*   You have an Amazoness equipped with "Raregold Armor", and "Amazoness Tiger", your opponent cannot attack.
*   "Ring of Magnetism" 'trumps' "Raregold Armor", "Amazoness Tiger", and "Marauding Captain". So if you have a monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", and a monster equipped with "Raregold Armor", the monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" is the target of attacks.
*   If you control "Patrician of Darkness" and have a monster equipped with "Raregold Armor", you can only re-direct attacks to the monster equipped with "Raregold Armor" as it is the only legal target.
