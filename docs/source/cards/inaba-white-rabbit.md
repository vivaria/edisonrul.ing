# Inaba White Rabbit

*   This card can only attack Life Points directly. It cannot attack another monster. If the opponent controls "Patrician of Darkness" and you attack with "Inaba White Rabbit", it is still a direct attack; they cannot select a monster as the attack target.
*   However, if the opponent controls a monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", your "Inaba White Rabbit" must attack the equipped monster if you chose to attack.
