# Pot Of Generosity

*   You return cards to the Deck when you resolve the effect (it’s not a cost).
*   You cannot activate “Pot of Generosity” if you have only 1 card in your hand besides “Pot of Generosity”.
*   If an effect is chained to “Pot of Generosity” so that you only have 1 or 0 cards in your hand, the effect of “Pot of Generosity” disappears. Do not return cards to the Deck and do not shuffle.
*   You can chain “Serial Spell” to “Pot of Generosity”, but you will have no hand so both effects will disappear.
