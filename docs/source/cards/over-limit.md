# OVER LIMIT

*   “Over Limit” cannot be activated if there are no Normal Monsters with 1000 or less ATK in the Graveyard that were destroyed in battle during the turn.
*   If a Normal Monster with 1000 or less ATK that was destroyed in battle is removed from the Graveyard and later in the same turn it is returned to the Graveyard by other means (Tributed, etc.), it cannot be Special Summoned with “Over Limit”.
