# EXCHANGE

*   You cannot activate "Exchange" if you have no other card in your hand besides "Exchange".
*   The opponent is still considered the owner of the card you take by the effect of "Exchange" for all purposes.
*   If you take your opponent’s "Kuriboh" through the effect of "Exchange" you may discard it to activate its effect (but it is discarded to your opponent’s Graveyard).
