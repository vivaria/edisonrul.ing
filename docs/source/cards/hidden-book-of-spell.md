# HIDDEN BOOK OF SPELL

*   If you have zero or 1 Spell Cards in your Graveyard, you cannot activate "Hidden Book of Spell".
*   When you activate "Hidden Book of Spell" and your opponent chains "Disappear" or "Graverobber", and 1 of the targeted Spell Cards is removed from play, the remaining Spell Card goes back to the Deck and the Deck is shuffled.
