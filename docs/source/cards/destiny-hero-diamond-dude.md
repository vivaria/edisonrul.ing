# DESTINY HERO - DIAMOND DUDE

> ① Once per turn, you can reveal the top card of your Deck. If it is a Normal Spell Card, send it to the Graveyard and you can activate its effect during the Main Phase of your next turn. If the card is not a Normal Spell Card, place it on the bottom of your Deck.

*   The ① Ignition Effect has no cost. The top card of the Deck is revealed as the effect resolves.
*   The effect of the revealed Normal Spell Card can be activated during your next turn's Main Phase even if Diamond Dude leaves the field.
*   That Normal Spell Card MUST still be in your Graveyard in order to activate its effect, starting a chain.
*   The Normal Spell Card itself is NOT being activated (played face-up), only its effect.
    *   Effects that target will select a legal target(s) (ex: a face-up monster for "Brain Control").
    *   Activation costs are bypassed (ex: discarding a Level 8 monster for "Trade-in").
    *   General Activation requirements are bypassed (ex: controlling a face-up "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" in order to activate "Burst Stream of Destruction").
    *   Timing Activation requirements cannot be bypassed. "[Curse of Fiend](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Card_Rulings:Curse_of_Fiend#Previously_Official_Rulings)" can only be activated during the Standby Phase, and thus its effect cannot be activated by Diamond Dude. "[Cold Wave](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cold_Wave)"'s effect can be activated so long as it is the first action you take in the Main Phase 1 \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=411261)\].
    *   Conditions are not applied (ex: the player may only activate one "Instant Fusion" per turn).
*   VS. "[Gold Sarcophagus](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Gold_Sarcophagus)":You can remove from play 1 card in your Deck, but it will not be added to your hand since "Gold Sarcophagus" itself was never activated (played face-up), only its effect.
*   VS. "[Different Dimension Capsule](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Different_Dimension_Capsule)": You can remove from play face-down 1 card in your Deck, but it will not be added to your hand since "Different Dimension Capsule" did not destroy itself by its own effect.
