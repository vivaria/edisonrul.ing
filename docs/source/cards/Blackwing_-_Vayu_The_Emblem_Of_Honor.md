# BLACKWING - VAYU THE EMBLEM OF HONOR  
> ① If this card is face-up on the field, you cannot use it for a Synchro Summon. ② If this card is in your Graveyard, you can remove from play this card plus 1 non-Tuner “Blackwing” monster in your Graveyard, and Special Summon 1 “Blackwing” Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck whose Level equals the total Levels of the removed monsters. The effect(s) of that Synchro Monster is negated.

*   The ① Continuous Effect CAN be negated (by "Skill Drain" or if Vayu is Special Summoned by Shura).
*   The ② Ignition Effect targets a "Blackwing" Monster in your Graveyard.
    *   Vayu + 1 non-Tuner "Blackwing" monster are removed from play when this effect resolves. This is not a cost.
    *   Both monsters must be removed from play by Vayu’s effect to perform the Special Summon.
        *   Example: Player A activates Vayu's effect targeting Sirocco in their Graveyard. Player B chains "D.D. Crow" and targets that same Sirocco. When the chain resolves, Vayu could not remove both itself and its target from play in the Graveyard. Thus, Player A's Vayu is not remove from play, and no "Blackwing" Synchro monster is Special Summoned.
    *   This effect does not perform a Synchro Summon. It can be activated while "Discord" is active.
    *   Since the monster was not properly Synchro Summoned, it cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard / removed from play (ex: "Call of the Haunted", "Return from the Different Dimension").
