# AIRKNIGHT PARSHATH  
> ① During battle between this attacking card and a Defense Position monster whose DEF is lower than the ATK of this card, inflict the difference as Battle Damage to your opponent. ② When this card inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent, draw 1 card.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies while this card is attacking.
    *   This effect will not apply if "Total Defense Shogun" attacks this card from Defense Position.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation.
    *   Drawing a card is not optional. You must draw 1 card any time "Airknight Parshath" inflicts Battle Damage to the opponent’s Life Points. This includes direct attacks, and when it battles with a monster with a lower ATK or DEF.
    *   If the opponent activates "Waboku" or "Kuriboh" to reduce the Battle Damage to 0, you do not draw.
    *   When "Airknight Parshath" attacks a face-down monster with a Flip Effect and inflicts Battle Damage, you draw 1 card before the Flip Effect is activated (in Substep 6 - Resolve Effects).
