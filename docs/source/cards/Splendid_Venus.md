# SPLENDID VENUS

*   If "Jinzo" and "Splendid Venus" are face-up on the field, Trap Cards and the effects of Trap Cards still cannot be activated because "Jinzo" prevents Trap Cards and Trap Card effects from being activated. The Continuous Effects of Trap Cards controlled by the player with "Splendid Venus" are not negated.
