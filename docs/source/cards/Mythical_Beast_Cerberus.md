# MYTHICAL BEAST CERBERUS

*   If the monster battling “Mythical Beast Cerberus” is removed from the field before (or during) damage calculation, the Spell Counters on “Cerberus” will not be removed.
*   Removing the Spell Counters from “Mythical Beast Cerberus” does not start a chain.
*   The Spell Counters on “Mythical Beast Cerberus” are removed after he battles no matter which player is attacking.
*   You place a Spell Counter on this card when the Spell Card resolves, so if "Magic Jammer" is used to negate the Spell Card's activation then you do not place a Spell Counter on this monster. But if "Imperial Order" is chained to the Spell Card, you still place a Spell Counter on this monster because the activation of the Spell Card was not negated. If the Spell Card was a Continuous, Equip, or Field Spell Card, and “Dust Tornado” is chained to its activation and destroys it before it resolves you still place a Spell Counter because the activation of the card was not negated.
*   "Mythical Beast Cerberus" must be face-up on the field when the Spell Card is activated in order to get a Spell Counter.
