> Pay 1000 Life Points. Declare a Type and an Attribute. Your opponent must send 1 monster with both the declared Type and Attribute from their hand or Deck to the Graveyard.

*   If your opponent sends a monster to the Graveyard with the declared Type and Attribute, you cannot see their hand and Deck. But if they claim to have no such card, you can check their hand and Deck to confirm.
