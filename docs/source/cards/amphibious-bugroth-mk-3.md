> ① While "Umi" is face-up on the field, this card can attack your opponent's Life Points directly.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   When "Umi" is on the field, and "Amphibious Bugroth MK-3" declares a direct attack, and "Umi" is destroyed during the Battle Step, "Amphibious Bugroth MK-3" can no longer attack directly, so a replay occurs.
