# SOLAR RECHARGE

> Discard 1 "Lightsworn" monster. ① Draw 2 cards then send the top 2 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard.

*   Discarding 1 "Lightsworn" monster is a cost.
*   The ① effect resolves sequentially. First, draw 2 cards, then send the top 2 to the Graveyard.
    *   This card can be activated while "Macro Cosmos" is active. The discarded "Lightsworn" monster and the top 2 cards sent to the Graveyard are all removed from play instead.
*   You cannot activate "Solar Recharge" if you have 3 or fewer cards remaining in your Deck.
