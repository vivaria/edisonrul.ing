# CHRYSALIS DOLPHIN

*   If you activate this effect and find that you do not have “Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin” in your hand or Deck your opponent can check both to verify.
*   If you Tribute “Chrysalis Dolphin” and your opponent chains an effect to destroy “Neo Space”, then the effect of “Chrysalis Dolphin” does not resolve.
