# TIGER DRAGON

*   "Tiger Dragon"'s effect targets the Set Spell or Trap Card(s).
*   If one of the targets is chained, it cannot be destroyed because it is no longer face-down. If 2 face-down Spell or Trap Cards are targeted and only 1 is chained, the remaining face-down Spell or Trap Card is still destroyed.
