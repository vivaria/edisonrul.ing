# SPIDER EGG

*   This card does not target.
*   If you do not have enough open Monster Card Zones to Special Summon the “Spider Tokens” in, you cannot activate “Spider Egg.”
*   If you do not have enough Monster Card Zones when “Spider Egg” resolves, the attack is not negated and no “Spider Tokens” are Summoned.
