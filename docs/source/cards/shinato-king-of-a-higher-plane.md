# SHINATO, KING OF A HIGHER PLANE

*   When your "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" destroys "Gradius' Option" or "Maju Garzett", your opponent takes no damage from "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane"'s effect.
*   If "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" is destroyed before monsters are sent to the Graveyard, for example if removed from play by "D. D. Warrior Lady", his effect does not activate. But if "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" attacks "Yomi Ship", "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" inflicts the damage from his effect even though he will be destroyed by "Yomi Ship"'s effect after "Yomi Ship" is sent to the Graveyard.
*   When "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" destroys a Defense Position monster, your opponent can activate "Barrel Behind the Door" as a chain to "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane"'s effect.
*   When your "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" is equipped with "Fairy Meteor Crush" and destroys your opponent's Defense Position monster, first, during damage calculation, "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent's Life Points because of "Fairy Meteor Crush", and then, when the Defense Position monster is sent to the Graveyard, "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane"'s effect inflicts damage equal to the original ATK of the destroyed monster.
