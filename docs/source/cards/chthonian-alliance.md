# Chthonian Alliance

*   The monster equipped with this card does not count towards the bonus. So if you have 2 “Dark Magicians” on the field, and 1 is equipped with “Chthonian Alliance”, it has +800 ATK.
*   Monsters on the opponent’s side of the field are counted for “Chthonian Alliance”.
*   Monsters that are treated as having the same name, like “Cyber Harpie Lady” and “Harpie Lady 3”, both count as “Harpie Lady” for purposes of “Chthonian Alliance”.
