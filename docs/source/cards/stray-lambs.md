# Stray Lambs

*   You cannot activate "Stray Lambs" the same turn that you Summon, Flip Summon, or Special Summon. But you can perform a Set the same turn. So you can activate "Stray Lambs" and then Tribute one of them to Set "Labyrinth Wall".
*   You can't activate "Stray Lambs" unless you have at least 2 vacant Monster Card Zones.
