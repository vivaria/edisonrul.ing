# CONSCRIPTION

*   Both players get to see the card picked up for “Conscription”.
*   If your Monster Card Zones are full, you can activate “Conscription”, and if you pick up a monster you can Normal Summon, it is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.
*   If you pick up a Spirit Monster, it cannot be Special Summoned so it is added to your opponent’s hand.
*   If you pick up “Rare Metal Dragon” for “Conscription”, it is added to your opponent’s hand.
*   If you cannot Summon because you activated “Scapegoat” or “Stray Lambs” that turn, you cannot activate “Conscription”.
*   You can use “Royal Oppression" to negate the Special Summon of “Conscription”.
