# RED-EYES B. CHICK

*   Ignition Effects on monsters cannot be activated while the Effect Monster is face-down. So this face-down monster cannot be Tributed for its own effect.
*   If you take control of your opponent’s "Red-Eyes B. Chick", you can activate its effect. In this case, the "Red-Eyes B. Chick" is sent to your opponent’s Graveyard, but you get to Special Summon "Red-Eyes B. Dragon" from your hand.
