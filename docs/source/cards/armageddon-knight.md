# Armageddon Knight

> ① When this card is Summoned, you can send 1 DARK monster from your Deck to the Graveyard.

*   The ① Trigger Effect is optional, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Trap Hole").
    *   While "Macro Cosmos" is active, the DARK monster sent is banished instead.
    *   This is not a cost. The DARK monster is sent to the Graveyard when this effect resolves.
    *   This effect CAN'T activate if this card was Summoned as Chain Link 2+ (by "Call of the Haunted").
