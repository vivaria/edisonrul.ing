# ANCIENT FOREST  
> ① When you activate this card, change any Defense Position monster(s) to face-up Attack Position. Flip Effects are not activated at this time. ② If a monster attacks, destroy it at the end of that turn's Battle Phase.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies when “Ancient Forest” resolves.
    *   If “Dust Tornado” is Chained to the activation of “Ancient Forest,” the Defense Position monsters are not changed to Attack Position because “Ancient Forest” is no longer face-up on the field.
    *   If you activate “Ancient Forest” with the effect of “Demise of the Land” it will not change Defense Position monsters to face-up Attack Position.
    *   “Ancient Forest” will not change a monster to face-up Attack Position if it was not on the field in Defense Position when “Ancient Forest” was activated.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger-like Effect activates during the End of the Battle Phase.
    *   If a player controls both “Ancient Forest” and a Gladiator Beast monster that has attacked, at the end of the Battle Phase he can choose which effect to activate and resolve first.
    *   If “Sasuke Samurai” attacks a face-down monster and destroys it with its effect, it will still be destroyed at the end of the Battle Phase.
    *   If a monster’s attack is negated by “Magic Cylinder” it will not be destroyed by this effect.
    *   If a monster attacks and is flipped face-down by “Book of Moon” it will still be destroyed. The effect of “Ancient Forest” will only destroy a monster during the turn it attacked.
    *   If a monster attacks and is removed from the field or ceases to be a monster before the end of the Battle Phase, it will not be destroyed.
    *   If a monster attacks while “Ancient Forest” is being negated, but before the end of the Battle Phase the effect negating “Ancient Forest” disappears, the monster that attacked will be destroyed.
