# LIGHTFORCE SWORD

*   If you chain "Lightforce Sword" to your opponent's Ritual Spell Card and remove from play the only Ritual Monster they could Ritual Summon, the Ritual Spell Card's effect disappears.
*   If the Standby Phase of your opponent's 4th turn is skipped, the card remains removed from play face-down.
*   If your opponent adds 1 of your Spell Cards to their hand with "Graverobber" and it is removed from play with "Lightforce Sword", during the Standby Phase of your opponent's 4th turn it is placed into your Graveyard instead of your opponent's hand.
