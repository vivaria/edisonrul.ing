# MACHINA ARMORED UNIT

> ① Once per turn, when a Machine-Type monster is destroyed by battle and sent to your Graveyard, you can Special Summon 1 Machine-Type monster from your Deck that has the same Attribute and less ATK than the destroyed monster.

*   The ① Trigger-like Effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   If the destroyed monster is no longer in the Graveyard when this effect resolves, you cannot Special Summon a monster from your Deck.
    *   The destroyed monster must be a Machine-Type monster on the field and in the Graveyard in order to activate this effect.
    *   You look at the Attribute and ATK of the Machine-Type monster while it’s in the Graveyard.
    *   If you control multiple copies of “Machina Armored Unit” you can activate each of them in a Chain and Special Summon 1 monster for each.
    *   If 2 monsters are destroyed and sent to your Graveyard at the same time, such as if your opponent controls one of your monsters and attacks another one of your monsters with the same ATK, you choose which one of those monsters you will look at when you activate the effect of “Machina Armored Unit.”
