# DARK NEPHTHYS

*   "Dark Nephthys'" first effect is an Ignition Effect. Removing DARK monsters from play is a cost.
*   You can activate "Dark Nephthys'" first effect while "Banisher of the Light" or "Macro Cosmos" is face-up, but "Dark Nephthys" will be removed from play.
*   "Dark Nephthys" effect to Special Summon itself starts a Chain.
*   The owner of "Dark Nephthys" Special Summons it, even if their opponent activated its first effect.
*   "Dark Nephthys'" third effect activates whenever it is Special Summoned, including by another card's effect. It is not optional.
