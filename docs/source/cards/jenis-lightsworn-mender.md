# Jenis, Lightsworn Mender

*   "Jenis, Lightsworn Mender"'s effect only activates once during the End Phase, even if cards were sent from your Deck to the Graveyard by the effects of multiple "Lightsworn" monsters.
*   If "Jenis, Lightsworn Mender" is Summoned after card(s) are sent from your Deck to the Graveyard by the effect of a "Lightsworn" Monster, "Jenis, Lightsworn Mender"'s effect still activates in the End Phase.
*   The damage and Life Point gain with "Jenis, Lightsworn Mender" happen at the same time, so it is possible to start a new Chain with "Numinous Healer" or "Attack and Receive", etc.
