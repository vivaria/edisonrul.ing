# DECK DEVASTATION VIRUS  
> Tribute 1 DARK monster with an ATK of 2000 points or more on your side of the field. ① Check all monsters on your opponent's side of the field, your opponent's hand, and all cards he/she draws (until the end of your opponent's 3rd turn after this card's activation), and destroy all monsters with an ATK of 1500 or less.

*   This card's cost requires that the monster have 2000 or more ATK while on the field.
    *   You can Tribute a face-down DARK monster with 2000 ATK (ex: "[Fusilier Dragon, the Dual-Mode Beast](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fusilier_Dragon,_the_Dual-Mode_Beast)" is Set without Tribute).
    *   An opponent's face-down monster targeted by "[Soul Exchange](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Soul_Exchange)" cannot be Tributed.
*   The ① Effect applies a Lingering Effect to the Duel. The lingering effect does not start a chain.
    *   You only check the cards on the field and in the hand when "Deck Devastation Virus" is resolved.
    *   If you draw a Monster Card(s) with 1500 ATK or less (ex: "D.D. Crow") in your Draw Phase, it is destroyed immediately and cannot chain its effect (because this does not start a Chain).
    *   If you draw a Monster Card(s) by card effect (ex: "Allure of Darkness"), resolve that effect first, then destroy any monsters with 1500 ATK or less drawn.
    *   Monsters in the hand / face-down with "?" ATK are treated as having 0 ATK for this effect \[[1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=752404), [2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=864787)\].
    *   If "Night Assailant" in your hand is destroyed by this effect, its effect will activate.
    *   Only cards drawn are checked until the end of your opponent's third End Phase.
    *   If "Deck Devastation Virus" is activated on your turn, the "first turn" lasts until the end of your opponent’s next turn.
*   After "Deck Devastation Virus" has resolved, it will NOT destroy monsters with <1500 ATK that:
    *   are Summoned (ex: "Mist Archfiend", "Stronghold the Moving Fortress", "Goat Tokens" Special Summoned by "Scapegoat").
    *   are added to the hand (by "Reinforcement of the Army", "Monster Reincarnation").
    *   you gain control of from your opponent (by "Brain Control", "Creature Swap").
*   VS. "[Exodia the Forbidden One](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Exodia_the_Forbidden_One)":
    *   If you use two "Backup Soldier" to return all 4 limbs to your hand (they will not be destroyed since they were not drawn), and on your next turn you draw "Exodia the Forbidden One", you win the game before "Exodia the Forbidden One" is destroyed by "Deck Devastation Virus".
