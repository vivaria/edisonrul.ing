# ELIMINATING THE LEAGUE

*   Discarding a Spell Card is a cost to activate this card.
*   This effect targets the opponent’s monster.
*   If the targeted monster is not destroyed by “Eliminating the League’s” effect, you cannot resolve the second part of this card’s effect (and you do not get to look at your opponent’s hand).
*   If a different “Six Samurai” is destroyed instead of the target, you cannot resolve the second part of “Eliminating the League’s” effect.
