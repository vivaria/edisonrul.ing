# SUCCESS PROBABILITY 0%

> Send 2 random Fusion Monsters from your opponent's Fusion Deck to the Graveyard.

*   If your opponent has no Extra Deck, you cannot activate “Success Probability 0%”.
*   “Success Probability 0%” does not target, because the cards are chosen randomly.
*   When this effect resolves, your opponent seperates their Extra Deck into the Synchro Deck and the Fusion Deck. You then send 2 random cards from the Fusion Deck to the Graveyard \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=812022)\].
