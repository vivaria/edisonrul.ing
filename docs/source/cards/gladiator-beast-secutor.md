# GLADIATOR BEAST SECUTOR

> ① If this card was Special Summoned by the effect of a "Gladiator Beast" monster, at the end of any Battle Phase, if this card attacks or was attacked, Special Summon 2 "Gladiator Beast" monsters from your Deck, except "Gladiator Beast Secutor".

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates if this card has engaged in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.
*   If you have only 1 available Monster Zone Space, you will still choose 2 “Gladiator Beast” monsters. You will Special Summon one, and the other will be destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.
*   If you only have 1 “Gladiator Beast” monster in Deck when resolving this effect, then no monster is Summoned when this effect resolves. Your opponent may verify by briefly revealing your Deck.
    *   You cannot activate this effect if your “Gladiator Beast” monster that battled was flipped face-down during the Battle Phase (even if it is flipped face-up before the end of the Battle Phase).
*   Returning the “Gladiator Beast” monster to the Deck is a cost.
*   You can shuffle your opponent's "Gladiator Beast" (that you obtained by "Brain Control") into their deck and Special Summon a different named "Gladiator Beast" from yours.
*   You cannot activate this effect unless there is a valid “Gladiator Beast” in Deck to Special Summon.
*   "Royal Oppression" and “Divine Wrath” can be chained to this effect. The effect will be negated, but the “Gladiator Beast” monster will not be destroyed because it is in the Deck.
*   If 2 or more “Gladiator Beast” battled this turn, their effects will activate and resolve separately.
    *   The turn player may resolve ALL their "Gladiator Beast" monsters' tag-out effects before their opponent is allowed to activate any of their own "Gladiator Beast" tag-out effects.
    *   They are not combined onto the same Chain.
*   If a "Gladiator Beast" monster's attack is stopped (by "Gravity Bind") or is negated (by "Negate Attack"), that "Gladiator Beast" cannot activate its effect at the end of the Battle Phase.
