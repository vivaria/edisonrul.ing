# JAR ROBBER

*   You can chain "Jar Robber" to your own or your opponent's "Pot of Greed".
*   The only way to activate "Jar Robber" is to chain it to the activation of "Pot of Greed".
*   "Jar Robber" must be the very next step in the chain, so if you activate "Pot of Greed" and your opponent chains "Imperial Order", you cannot activate "Jar Robber".
