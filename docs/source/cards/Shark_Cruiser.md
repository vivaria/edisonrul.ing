# SHARK CRUISER

*   This effect is a Trigger effect.
*   Even if this card is destroyed during the resolution of a Chain, you can activate its effect after the Chain finishes resolving. It does not “miss the timing.”
*   You cannot activate this effect if you have no Level 4 or lower WATER monsters in your Deck.
*   If your opponent controls your “Shark Cruiser” and destroys it with a card effect you cannot activate the effect of “Shark Cruiser.”
