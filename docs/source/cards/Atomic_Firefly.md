# ATOMIC FIREFLY  
> ① When this face-up card on the field attacks or is attacked and it is destroyed as a result of battle, the player who destroyed it takes 1000 points of damage.

*   The ① Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves in the Graveyard / banished.
    *   The card text is very correct on the card mechanics; "Atomic Firefly" has to be face-up BEFORE the attack is declared.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   You can use "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Atomic Firefly"'s effect.
