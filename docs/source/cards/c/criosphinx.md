### Card Rulings

*   The effect of “Criosphinx” is a Trigger Effect, and can be chained to. You can activate “Divine Wrath” against it. If a monster is returned to the hand in the middle of a chain, the effect of “Criosphinx” activates as a new chain after the previous chain has finished resolving.
*   If multiple copies of “Criosphinx” are in play and a monster is returned to the hand, all copies will activate. It forms a chain, with the turn player’s “Criosphinx” as chain link 1.
*   If multiple monsters are sent to the hand simultaneously (such as with “Guardian Sphinx”), the effect of “Criosphinx” only activates once, so only 1 card is sent to the GY.
