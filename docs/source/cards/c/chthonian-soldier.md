# Chthonian Soldier

*   The damage dealt by this card’s effect is Effect Damage, not Battle Damage.
*   This card’s effect is a Trigger Effect. It activates in the Graveyard.
*   If the opponent takes control of your “Chthonian Soldier” with “Snatch Steal” and you attack it next turn, its effect will not activate because when it is sent to your Graveyard, it was not your opponent’s monster that attacked it.
