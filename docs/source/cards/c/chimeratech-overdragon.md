# Chimeratech Overdragon

*   When you Fusion Summon this card you can use a substitute, such as “King of the Swamp”, for the “Cyber Dragon”, but not for the Machine-Type monsters. That means you can use a maximum of 1 substitute monster in the Fusion Summon.
*   The effect that sends all your other cards to the Graveyard is a Trigger Effect and it can be chained to.
*   “Chimeratech Overdragon” can attack the same monster more than once if the attack target is not destroyed, such as an Attack Position “Spirit Reaper”.
*   If “Chimeratech Overdragon” attacks directly, and then the opponent Special Summons a monster during the same Battle Phase it cannot attack it.
*   You can activate “De-Fusion” and target “Chimeratech Overdragon”, but you can only Special Summon the Fusion Material Monsters if you have enough vacant Monster Card Zones for ALL of the Fusion Material Monsters you used.
*   If this card is Special Summoned by the effect of "Future Fusion" while you have "Cyber Phoenix" in Attack Position, when this card's effect sends all other cards you control to the Graveyard "Future Fusion" is still being negated, so the "Chimeratech Overdragon" will not be destroyed and remains on the field.
