### Card Text

> ① When this card is Tribute Summoned, remove from play 1 card on the field. If it was a DARK Monster Card, inflict 1000 damage to your opponent.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates when Caius is successfully Tribute Summoned.
*   If the target is a DARK Monster Card when banished, inflict 1000 Points of damage.
    *   Your opponent CAN use "Gorz, the Emissary of Darkness"'s effect in response to the Effect Damage which was inflicted AFTER their only card (a DARK monster) was banished.  
    *   DO NOT inflict damage if the monster is not DARK when banished by this effect.  
        *   Examples include Token Monsters, Trap Monster, Monsters who are only DARK while face-up on the field (ex: "Light and Darkness Dragon").  
            
    *   DO NOT inflict damage if the DARK Monster is banished by a Condition instead.  
        *   Examples include "Battle Fader", and "Plaguespreader Zombie".  
            
    *   DO inflict damage when a DARK Monster equipped to "Relinquished" is removed from play.  
    *   The target must remain on the field in order to be removed from play by this effect.
*   You CAN Tribute Summon Caius while "Imperial iron Wall" is active.
    *   This effect STILL activates while "Imperial Iron Wall" is active (starting a chain). A target it declared, but no cards can be removed from play while "Imperial Iron Wall"'s effect applies.
*   "[Monarch](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Monarch)"'s Trigger Effects are Spell Speed 1 and activate at the time they are successfully Tribute Summoned. If the opponent wants to activate a card like "[Bottomless Trap Hole](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Bottomless_Trap_Hole)", it will be placed onto the chain after the "[Monarch](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Monarch)"'s effect. But "[Monarchs](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Monarch)" don't need to remain on the field to resolve their effects, so destroying them with "[Bottomless Trap Hole](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Bottomless_Trap_Hole)" will not negate their effect.
