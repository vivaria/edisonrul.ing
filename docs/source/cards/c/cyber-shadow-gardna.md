### Card Rulings

*   A Field Spell Card or similar effect will adjust the ATK/DEF of “Cyber Shadow Gardna” accordingly after it copies the ATK & DEF of another monster.
*   You cannot chain to the effect of “Cyber Shadow Gardna” that copies another monster’s ATK & DEF.
*   “Light of Intervention” only stops you from Setting monsters. Since the final effect of “Cyber Shadow Gardna” Sets it as a Trap Card, this effect will still happen even if “Light of Intervention” is active.
*   If you use “Limiter Removal” on your “Cyber Shadow Gardna”, both effects (destroy it because of “Limiter Removal”, and change it back into a Trap Card by its own effect) happen during the End Phase in the order of the controller’s preference.
