### Card Rulings

1. This effect doesn't target.
2. Sending "Machina Soldier", "Machina Sniper", and "Machina Defender" to the GY is a cost.
3. You can't send any of the listed 'Machina' cards to the GY if they are being treated as Equip Cards.
4. If you don't have a "Machina Force" in your hand/Deck, you can't activate the effect of "Commander Covington". If you no longer have one when the effect resolves, your opponent can ask to verify.
