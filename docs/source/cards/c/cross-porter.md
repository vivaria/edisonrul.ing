### Card Text

> ① You can send 1 monster you control to the Graveyard and Special Summon 1 “Neo-Spacian” monster from your hand. ② When this card is sent to the Graveyard, you can add 1 “Neo-Spacian” monster from your Deck to your hand.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Ignition Effect targets 1 monster you control.
    *   The target is sent to the Graveyard when the effect resolves.
    *   If "Cross Porter" targets itself and is flipped face-down (by "Book of Moon"), the effect still resolves.
    *   If another monster targeted by this effect is flipped face-down / removed from the field, this effect will resolve without effect. This is also applies if "Cross Porter" targets itself and leaves the field.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect follows a "When... you can" structure and can miss the timing
    *   If "Cross Porter" targets itself with its first effect, its second effect CANNOT be activated.
