# Card Trader

*   Shuffling 1 card into your Deck is a cost.
*   Using this effect starts a Chain.
*   If you have your opponent’s card in your hand and return it to their Deck to pay the cost of this effect, you still Draw as normal.
*   If your opponent controls “Protector of the Sanctuary”, you cannot activate this effect.
