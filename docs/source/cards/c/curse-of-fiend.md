### Card Text

> Changes the battle positions of all Attack Position monsters on the field to Defense Position and vice-versa. These positions cannot be changed during the turn this card is activated except by the effect of a Spell, Trap or Effect Monster Card. You can activate this card only during your Standby Phase.

### Card Rulings

*   This card must be Set in order to be activated during your Standby Phase. During your Standby Phase you flip up the face-down "Curse of Fiend" to activate its effect.
*   Face-down monsters changed to Attack Position will have their Flip Effects (and "_when this card is flipped face-up_" Trigger Effects) activated \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=282964)\]. This is NOT a Flip Summon, and will not cause "Swarm of Scarabs" to activate its Trigger Effect.
*   VS. "Final Attack Order": While "Final Attack Orders" is active, you can change the Battle Positions of monsters with "Curse of Fiend" or "Little-Winguard", but the Battle Positions are immediately changed back to Attack Position by "Final Attack Orders".
*   VS. "Destiny Hero Diamond Dude": You cannot activate the effect of "Curse of Fiend", because it can only be activated during the Standby Phase.
