### Card Text

> You can only activate this card when a monster(s) with an ATK of 1000 or less is Normal Summoned, Flip Summoned or Special Summoned. Remove from play those Summoned monster(s), and your opponent removes from play all cards of the same name in their hand and Deck. Their Deck is then shuffled.

### Card Rulings

*   This card activates in the Summon response timing (like "Trap Hole").
    *   This card cannot be activated if a monster was Normal / Special Summoned as Chain Link 2+.
    *   You can activate "Chain Disappearance" in response to your own Summon of a monster. In which case, your opponent still removes all cards with that name from their hand and Deck.
    *   A Flip Summon that triggers a Flip / Trigger Effect will be Chain Link 1, this card be Chain Link 2.
    *   This effect does not target. It can remove multiple monsters Summoned simultaneously.
        *   Example: "Chain Disappearance" will remove all 4 "Sheep Tokens" Summoned by "Scapegoat".
    *   If "Chain Disappearance" is unable to remove from play the monster(s) because it was flipped face-down / removed from the field, your opponent does not banish any cards from their hand / Deck.
    *   If a Fusion / Synchro Monster is removed from play, remove from play any copies in the Extra Deck.
*   If this card destroys a Monster, your must briefly reveal their Deck to verify that all copies of the Monster Card within the Deck have been removed from play \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=822229), [REF2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=960621)\].
    *   This cannot take place when using online duel simulators, as viewing your opponent's would allow an opportunity for foul play (via screen captures).
