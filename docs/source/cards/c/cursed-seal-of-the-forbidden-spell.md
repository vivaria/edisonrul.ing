### Card Rulings

*   Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell only negates the activation of Spell Cards. It does not prevent the use of Continuous Spell Cards already active, like Archfiend's Oath.
*   If you activate a Spell Card and chain Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell, then your opponent can't activate Spell Cards of the same name, even though your opponent didn't activate the Spell Card in the first place.
*   When you negate and destroy Black Pendant with Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell, and afterwards a Set Black Pendant is destroyed, the effect of Black Pendant won't be activated (neither the Black Pendant that was negated nor the Set Black Pendant destroyed later will inflict 500 damage).
