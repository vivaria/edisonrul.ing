### Card Rulings

*   The Continuous Effect does not activate.
*   VS. Clear World: If you control Clear Vice Dragon and any EARTH, FIRE, or WATER monsters, the effect of Clear World will start a Chain but it will resolve without effect.
*   The Continuous Effect begins to apply during Substep 1 - Start of the Damage Step.
*   If an opponent activates the effect of “Honest” when “Clear Vice Dragon” battles their LIGHT monster, “Clear Vice Dragon’s” ATK will become twice the boosted ATK of the opponent’s monster.
*   If this card attacks “The Wicked Avatar” its ATK will become double that of “The Wicked Avatar” then “The Wicked Avatar” would become this card’s ATK plus 100. No further change will occur.
*   The Continuous Effect applies while resolving an opponent's effect that would destroy this card.
*   Discarding a card is an effect, not a cost (this can trigger the effects of “Dark World” monsters).
*   You choose which card you want to discard to prevent this card’s destruction.
*   This effect only substitutes this card's destruction. It does not negate the opponent's card effect.
*   If your opponent's Monster’s effect would destroy this card and you Chain an effect to take control of that monster, you can still discard 1 card to prevent this card's destruction.
