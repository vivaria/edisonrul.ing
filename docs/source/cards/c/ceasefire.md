### Card Rulings

*   "Ceasefire" can be activated if there is at least 1 face-down Defense Position monster and/or at least 1 face-up Effect Monster.
*   Monsters flipped by "Ceasefire" are not Flip Summoned, so the effect of "Mysterious Puppeteer" does not activate.
*   If you chain "Ceasefire" to the Flip Effect of a monster, the Flip Effect is not negated.
*   If "Jinzo" is flipped by "Ceasefire", the damage from "Ceasefire"'s effect is still inflicted.
*   Monster Tokens and monsters being treated as Equip Cards are not counted as Effect Monsters.
