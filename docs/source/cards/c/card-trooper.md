### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① Once per turn: You can choose 1, 2, or 3, then send that many cards from the top of your Deck to the GY; until the End Phase, this card gains 500 ATK for each card sent to the GY this way.
> ② If this card you control is destroyed and sent to your GY: Draw 1 card.

### Card Rulings

*   Sending to the GY is a cost.
If "Dimensional Fissure" is applying, you can't activate the ① effect, even if you know that the top card of your Deck is not a Monster.
*   After the ① effect resolves, if this card later has its effect negated, the ATK increase is negated.
*   If this card in your Spell/Trap Zone is destroyed, the ② effect still activates.
