### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① At the start of your Main Phase 1:
> Until your next turn, Spell/Trap Cards/Effects can't be Set on the field nor activated.

### Card Rulings

*   While this effect is applying, effects of already face-up Spells/Traps also can’t be activated.
(However, continuous Spell/Trap effects will still apply).
*   This means that if this effect is applying, the effect of Royal Oppression can’t be activated.
*   This also means that effects like that of Armory arm can't be activated, as it is being treated as a Spell Card.
