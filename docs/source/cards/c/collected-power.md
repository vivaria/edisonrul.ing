# Collected Power

*   If "Kisetai" is moved by the effect of "Collected Power" it is destroyed.
*   Monster Cards equipped to "Sword Hunter" can be moved to another "Sword Hunter", but if they are moved to any other monster they are destroyed.
*   Monster Cards equipped to "Relinquished" or "Thousand-Eyes Restrict" can be moved to another "Relinquished or "Thousand-Eyes Restrict" but if either of these monsters is already equipped with a Monster Card, the new one is destroyed. If these moved to any other monster, the cards are destroyed.
*   You can move "Snatch Steal" with this card’s effect, and it will affect the newly equipped monster (the controller of "Snatch Steal" gains control of it, and loses control of the previously equipped monster).
*   If a "Premature Burial" already equipped to a monster is moved to a new monster by the effect of "Collected Power", both "Premature Burial" and the original monster it was equipped to are destroyed. If you chain "Collected Power" to "Premature Burial", the monster in the Graveyard that was targeted never leaves the Graveyard and "Premature Burial" is destroyed.
*   If multiple Union Monsters are going to be equipped to 1 legal target monster by "Collected Power", you select 1 of them and equip it to the target monster, and the other Union Monster Cards are destroyed.
