> ② You can target this card and 1 other face-up monster you control; banish both targets, then draw 2 cards.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① effect can activate and resolve while “Skill Drain” is applying.
*   The ② effect can target a token monster.
(in which case you still draw, and the token is destroyed).
*   If the ② effect is activated, the other target must be face-up to be banished.
(This card doesn’t need to stay face-up to be banished. If either isn’t banished, none are banished; no cards are drawn).
