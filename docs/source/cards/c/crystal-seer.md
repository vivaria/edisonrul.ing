### Card Rulings

●If there are less than 2 cards in your deck when this effect resolves, nothing happens.
●If 'Thunder King Rai-Oh' is applying, this effect still activates. 1 of the cards is sent to the GY and 1 of the cards is returned to the bottom of the Deck.
●The cards aren't revealed to your opponent
(on Duelingbook, this can be resolved by drawing 2 cards, then placing 1 of the drawn cards on the bottom).
