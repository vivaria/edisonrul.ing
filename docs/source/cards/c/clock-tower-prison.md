*   Putting a Clock Counter on “Clock Tower Prison” can be chained to. The effect to Special Summon “Destiny Hero – Dreadmaster” can also be chained to. Even though this effect can be chained to, it cannot be chained to with an effect that negates the activation of a Spell Card, such as “Magic Jammer” or “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8” because the “Clock Tower Prison” card has already resolved.
*   The effect that stops Battle Damage is a Continuous Effect that cannot be chained to.
*   If “Clock Tower Prison” with 4 or more Clock Counters is destroyed because a new Field Spell Card is activated, “Clock Tower Prison’s” effect will activate.
*   If “Spell Canceller” is Summoned or “Imperial Order” is activated, all the Clock Counters will be removed from “Clock Tower Prison”.
