### Card Text

> ① This card gains 100 ATK for every Warrior-Type monster in any Graveyard. ② When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, you can Special Summon 1 Warrior-Type monster from either player's Graveyard.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Continuous Effect re-calculates as the total of Warrior-Type monsters in the Graveyards changes.
    *   This process does not start a chain, even in instances where the ATK gain changes.
    *   VS. "Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind"'s effect is used to halve the ATK of "Collossal Fighter" while he was +400, the ① Continuous Effect ceases to change the ATK and its value becomes locked at the new value (2800 + 400 = 3200; once halved by Gale = 1600 ATK) so long as "Colossal Fighter" remains face-up.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step when "Colossal Fighter" is destroyed by battle and finally sent to the Graveyard.
    *   This is actually an optional effect, the change being clarified in the DL09 print \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?p=13618243#post13618243)\].
    *   This effect targets a Warrior-Type monster in the Graveyard and will be negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   This effect can be used to Special Summon the same "Colossal Fighter" that was destroyed, even if he is the only Warrior-Type monster in the Graveyard(s).
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect WILL NOT ACTIVATE IF:
    *   "Colossal Fighter" was removed from play After Damage Calculation by "D.D. Warrior Lady’s" effect.
    *   "Colossal Fighter" was destroyed After Damage Calculation by the Flip Effect of "Man-Eater Bug".
    *   A Defense Position "Colossal Fighter" was shuffled into the Deck by "Ehren, Lightsworn Monk".
