# Chthonian Blast

*   This effect does not target.
*   This card can be activated during the Damage Step if a monster is destroyed as a result of battle. However, it cannot be activated if a monster is destroyed by an effect during the Damage Step.
*   You cannot activate this card if your face-up monster is destroyed in the middle of a chain.
