# Cloudian - Poison Cloud

*   “Cloudian – Poison Cloud’s” effect will only inflict 800 damage if its effect successfully destroys the monster that destroyed it in battle. For example, “Vennominaga, the Deity of Poisonous Snakes” is unaffected by other Monster Effects and thus could not be destroyed, so “Cloudian – Poison Cloud” would not inflict damage in this case.
