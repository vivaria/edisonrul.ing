# Chain Thrasher

*   When this card makes an additional attack, the opponent can activate “Disappear” to remove the other “Chain Thrasher” from the Graveyard, and the attack stops. Do not proceed to the Damage Step.
*   If you have 1 “Chain Thrasher” in the Graveyard and 1 on the field equipped with “Twin Swords of Flashing Light – Tryce”, its still only gets 2 attacks.
