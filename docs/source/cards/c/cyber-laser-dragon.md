### Card Rulings

*   This card’s effect targets. You can destroy “Cyber Laser Dragon” with its own effect.
*   The ATK or DEF of the targeted monster must be greater than (or equal to) the ATK of “Cyber Laser Dragon” when the effect resolves in order for it to be destroyed. Example: You target “Jinzo” with this card’s effect. The opponent chains “Rush Recklessly” to raise “Cyber Laser Dragon’s” ATK to 3100. “Jinzo” is not destroyed.
*   If “Book of Moon” is chained to “Cyber Laser Dragon’s” effect to turn either the targeted monster or “Cyber Laser Dragon” face-down, its effect will not resolve because both monsters’ ATK / DEF values can no longer be compared.
