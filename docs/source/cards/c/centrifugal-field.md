### Card Rulings

*   Only the owner of the Fusion Monster that was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by a card effect can Special Summon a Fusion Material Monster written on the Fusion Monster Card. However, this effect can be used by both players (when their Fusion Monsters are destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by a card effect).
*   If both players have Fusion Monsters destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by card effects at the same time, each of them can Special Summon a Fusion Material Monster. However, when multiple Fusion Monsters controlled by the same player are destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by a card effect, that player can only select and Special Summon 1 Fusion Material Monster.
*   Unlike “De-Fusion”, the Fusion Material Monsters Special Summoned with “Centrifugal Field” do not have to have been used to Fusion Summon the Fusion Monster. In fact, that Fusion Monster does not have to have been properly Fusion Summoned at all (it could have been Special Summoned with “Magical Scientist” or “Summoner of Illusions” instead).
*   Substitute Fusion Material Monsters like “King of the Swamp” cannot be Special Summoned with “Centrifugal Field” because they are not written on the Fusion Monster Card. However, if they were used as substitutes to Fusion Summon the Fusion Monster, you can still use “Centrifugal Field” to Special Summon the other Fusion Material monster from the Fusion Summon.
*   You can chain to the activation of the effect of “Centrifugal Field”.
