# Crystal Beast Cobalt Eagle

*   You choose whether or not to use the “Crystal Beast” effect at the time the destroyed monster would be sent to the Graveyard.
*   This effect does not use the Chain.
*   This effect cannot be used if a “Crystal Beast” monster is destroyed by a card effect while face-down.
*   If multiple “Crystal Beast” monsters are destroyed at the same time, and you do not have enough open Spell & Trap Card Zones to place them all in as Continuous Spell Cards, you choose which (if any) to place in your Spell & Trap Card Zone.
*   If your opponent controls one of your “Crystal Beast” mosters and it is destroyed, your opponent can choose to place it in their Spell & Trap Card Zone. If they choose not to, it is sent to your Graveyard.
*   If "Macro Cosmos" or "Banisher of the Light" is active on the field when a "Crystal Beast" monster is destroyed, you can use its effect and still place it in your Spell & Trap Card Zone.
*   If a "Crystal Beast" battles with a monster such as "Dark Magician of Chaos" or "D.D. Warrior" it will be removed from play by that monster's effect, you cannot activate your "Crystal Beast"'s effect.
*   If a "Crystal Beast" is destroyed by "Bottomless Trap Hole" it will be removed from play and you cannot activate its effect.
*   While "Skill Drain" is active on the field, a "Crystal Beast" monster that is destroyed will be sent to the Graveyard and cannot be put in the Spell & Trap Card Zone.
*   If you control a "Crystal Beast" equipped with "Premature Burial" and have no open Spell & Trap Card Zones, when that "Crystal Beast" is destroyed "Premature Burial" is also destroyed and then you can choose to put that "Crystal Beast" into the now empty Zone.
*   If "Dimensional Fissure" is active on the field when a "Crystal Beast" that was being treated as a Continuous Spell Card card is sent to the Graveyard, it will not be removed from play, because it was treated as a Spell and not a monster.
*   You can use a "Crystal Beast" that is being treated as a Continuous Spell Card for the cost to Special Summon "Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder" or "Anteatereatingant".
