### Card Rulings

*   This card targets 1 “Koa’ki Meiru” monster in your GY. The effect of “Core Reinforcement” that deals damage to its controller starts a Chain.
*   If your face-up “Core Reinforcement” is destroyed during the End Phase by “Mystical Space Typhoon,” you won't take damage equal to the Summoned monster’s ATK.
*   If “Imperial Custom” is face-up on the field and the monster Summoned by “Core Reinforcement” is destroyed, “Core Reinforcement” will remain face-up on the field but the controller will still take damage. If “Core Reinforcement” and the monster it has Summoned are destroyed at the same time, such as by “Icarus Attack,” the effect to inflict damage will still be applied.
