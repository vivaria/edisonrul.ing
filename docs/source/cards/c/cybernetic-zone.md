# Cybernetic Zone

*   Returning the Fusion Monster that was removed from play to the field does not start a Chain.
*   The Fusion Monster's ATK is only doubled if it is returned to the field with "Cybernetic Zone"'s effect.
*   Destroying the returned monster during your next Standby Phase does not start a Chain.
*   When the monster is returned to the field, its total ATK is doubled. Any ATK gained afterwards is not doubled.
