# Crimson Fire

*   If the opponent activates a card that inflicts damage to both players, such as "Tremendous Fire", and you respond with “Crimson Fire,” you take no damage and your opponent takes 2500 damage (the 500 normal, plus double the 1000 damage you would have taken).
*   If you control “Red Dragon Archfiend/Assault Mode” but not “Red Dragon Archfiend,” you cannot activate “Crimson Fire.”
