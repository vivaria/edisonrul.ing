# GRINDER GOLEM

*   You cannot Special Summon "Grinder Golem" if you do not have 2 open Monster Zone Spaces for the "Grinder Tokens".
*   If your opponent negates the Special Summon of "Grinder Golem", the "Grinder Tokens" remain on your side of the field and you cannot Normal Summon or Set that turn.
*   If you Special Summon "Grinder Golem" while "King Tiger Wanghu" is face-up on the field, its effect activates to destroy the "Grinder Tokens" after "Grinder Golem" is Special Summoned.
