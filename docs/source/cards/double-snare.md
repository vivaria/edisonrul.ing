# Double Snare

*   You can destroy "Jinzo", "Royal Decree", "Tyrant Dragon", "Sorcerer of Dark Magic", "Fiend Skull Dragon", and "The Dragon’s Bead" with this card’s effect.
*   You cannot destroy "Ryu Senshi" because of its effect that prevents it from being targeted by a Spell Card.
*   You cannot destroy "Reaper of the Cards" or "Trap Master" because they do not negate Trap Cards, they destroy Trap Cards.
*   You can only destroy face-up cards with the effect of "Double Snare". The opponent may chain "Book of Moon" to your "Double Snare" to flip his / her monster face-down, and it will not be destroyed.
