# FACTORY OF 100 MACHINES

*   "Factory of 100 Machines" targets 1 Machine-Type monster you control.
*   Removing all "Morphtronic" monsters in your Graveyard from play is not a cost. If an effect is chained that removes the targeted Machine-Type monster from the field, you must still remove all "Morphtronic" monsters in your Graveyard from play when "Factory of 100 Machines" resolves.
