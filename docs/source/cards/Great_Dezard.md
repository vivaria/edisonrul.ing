# GREAT DEZARD

*   After destroying a second monster, "Great Dezard" still retains his first effect.
*   If your opponent uses "Double Snare" against "Great Dezard" after "Great Dezard" has achieved his first effect, "Double Snare" is negated and destroyed.
*   If "Great Dezard" is removed from the field after activating his first effect and then returns to the field, he loses his previously-achieved effect(s).
*   You can Special Summon only 1 "Fushioh Richie" by Tributing "Great Dezard".
*   "Great Dezard" can achieve his effects by destroying Monster Tokens.
