# KUNOICHI

*   If an effect is chained that removes "Kunoichi" from the field, its new controller still discards 1 card.
*   If you give control of your face-up "Kunoichi" to your opponent while "Remove Brainwashing" is active, it is immediately returned to your control and when its effect resolves you will discard 1 card.
