# JUNK SYNCHRON  
> ① When this card is Normal Summoned, you can Special Summon 1 Level 2 or lower monster from your Graveyard in face-up Defense Position. That monster's effect(s) is negated.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Trap Hole").
    *   This effect targets a monster in the Graveyard. It is negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   This effect only negates the target's effects that activate on the field. It can still activate its effects.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down / leaves the field, its effects are no longer negated.
*   This effect can't activate if Junk was Normal Summoned as Chain Link 2+ by "Ultimate Offering".
