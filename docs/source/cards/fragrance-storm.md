# FRAGRANCE STORM

*   "Fragrance Storm" targets 1 Plant-Type monster on the field. You can target any Plant-Type monster on the field.
*   Destroying the targeted card and drawing 1 card are considered to happen at the same time. Revealing the drawn card, if it is a Plant-Type monster, happens after that.
*   If, after revealing the drawn Plant-Type monster, you draw another Plant-Type monster, you cannot reveal the additional Plant-Type monster to try and draw another card.
*   If you have an active "Solemn Wishes" and you draw 2 cards with "Frangrance Storm", you will gain 1000 Life Points.
*   Destroying the Plant-Type monster and drawing 1 card resolve at the same time, but drawing 1 additional card by revealing the drawn Plant-Type monster does not resolve at the same time. If you destroy "Seed of Flame" with "Fragrance Storm"'s effect, you can activate "Seed of Flame"'s effect if you draw only 1 card, but if you reveal a Plant-Type monster to draw another card, you cannot activate "Seed of Flame"'s effect.
