# THE THING IN THE CRATER

*   You can Special Summon a high-level Normal Monster with "The Thing in the Crater"'s effect, but not a "Special Summon-only" monster.
*   The "Thing in the Crater"'s effect activates even if destroyed face-down and sent to the Graveyard.
*   When you have a monster equipped with "Metalsilver Armor", your opponent can activate "The Thing in the Crater"'s effect because it doesn't target.
