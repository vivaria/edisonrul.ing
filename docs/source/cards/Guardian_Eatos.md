# GUARDIAN EATOS  
> Ⓤ If you have no monsters in your Graveyard, you can Special Summon this card from your hand. ① You can send 1 Equip Spell Card equipped to this card to the Graveyard to select and remove from play up to 3 monsters in your opponent's Graveyard. This card gains 500 ATK for each monster removed by this effect, until the End Phase.

*   The Ⓤ Unclassified effect works like a built-in Special Summon. This does not start a Chain.
*   The ① Ignition Effect sends an Equip Spell equipped to this card to the Graveyard for cost.
    *   You can send an opponent’s Equip Spell equipped to this card to the Graveyard as the cost.
    *   This effect targets 1, 2, or 3 monsters in your opponent’s Graveyard.
    *   Removing the targets from play and increasing this card’s ATK occur simultaneously.
    *   If a target disappears, the other targets are removed from play and Eatos gains ATK accordingly.
