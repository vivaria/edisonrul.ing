# BELIAL - MARQUIS OF DARKNESS

> ① Your opponent cannot select any monster you control, except "Belial - Marquis of Darkness", as an attack target, or as a target of a Spell or Trap Card.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies so long as "Belial - Marquis of Darkness" is face-up on the field.
    *   If a Spell / Trap Card targets 1 monster you control and you chain "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Belial - Marquis of Darkness", the effect is still resolved as normal.
    *   Monsters in your Graveyard can still be targeted by your opponent's Spell / Trap Cards.
    *   This effect does not apply to face-down monsters you control \[REF needed, errata'd in 2011\].
*   While the ① Continuous Effect applies, your opponent can:
    *   use Spell / Trap Cards which do not target (ex: "Bottomless Trap Hole", "Smashing Ground");
    *   target your other monsters with monster effects (ex: "Caius the Shadow Monarch");
    *   target your face-down Defense Position monsters with Spell / Trap Cards & Effects \[REF needed, errata'd in 2011\];
    *   attack your face-down Defense Position monsters \[REF needed, errata'd in 2011\].
*   If you control "Evil HERO Malicious Fiend" & "Belial - Marquis of Darkness", and their effects are active, your opponent's monsters are changed to Attack Position and must attack "Evil HERO Malicious Fiend".
