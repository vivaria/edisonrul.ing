# MERMAID KNIGHT

*   "Mermaid Knight" can attack twice if "Maiden of the Aqua" is making the field treated as "Umi".
*   If you declare your second attack with "Mermaid Knight", and "Umi" is destroyed during the Battle Step, a replay occurs and you cannot attack a second time with "Mermaid Knight".
*   If there is no "Umi" on the field and "Mermaid Knight" attacks, then you Special Summon "Maiden of the Aqua" to treat the field as "Umi", you can attack a second time.
