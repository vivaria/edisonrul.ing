# BOUNTIFUL ARTEMIS

> ① Draw 1 card from your Deck each time a Counter Trap Card is activated.

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not start a chain.
*   "Bountiful Artemis" must be face-up on the field in order to apply this effect.
*   This effect will not apply for any Counter Trap Cards which might [negate the Summon](https://www.edisonformat.com/summons.html) of Artemis.
*   You will draw 1 card immediately after a Counter Trap’s effects have resolved.
*   This effect will activate even if your opponent is the one who resolved the effect of a Counter Trap.
*   If “Seven Tools of the Bandit” negates the activation of another Counter Trap Card (ex: “Magic Jammer”), you do not draw a card for “Magic Jammer” since its activation was negated.
