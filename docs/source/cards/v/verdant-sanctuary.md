### Card Rulings

● If a Set insect is attacked, this effect won't activate.
(It needs to be face-up when targeted for the attack).
● If 2 insects are destroyed at the same time, this effect triggers twice.
● You search equal to the original Level of the Insect in the GY, not its level on the field.
