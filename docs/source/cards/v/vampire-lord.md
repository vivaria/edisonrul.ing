### Card Rulings

*   Your Vampire Lord will only be Special Summoned by his own effect when destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by a card effect that your opponent controls, not by your own card effects or as a result of battle.
*   Vampire Lord will only return to play with his effect when the owner controls it, because Vampire Lord must be “destroyed and sent to YOUR Graveyard”.
*   When your opponent takes control of your Vampire Lord, and it inflicts Battle Damage to your Life Points, then the first effect of Vampire Lord is activated. But the second effect will not be activated if Vampire Lord is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard while your opponent controls him.
*   If you Summon "Vampire Lord" (except by its effect) and he is destroyed by your opponent's "Horn of Heaven" or "Solemn Judgment", "Vampire Lord" will be Special Summoned in your next Standby Phase. When it is Special Summoned by its own effect “Horn of Heaven” or “Solemn Judgment” cannot be activated, because it is being Summoned by its own Trigger Effect, not by a built-in “this is how you Summon this monster” effect.
*   When Vampire Lord is destroyed (by a card effect) while in your hand, in your Deck, or on the field, he will be Special Summoned in your next Standby Phase.
*   When Vampire Lord is Tributed (including by your opponent with Soul Exchange), or when he is “sent to the Graveyard”, he will not be Special Summoned by his own effect because he was not “destroyed”.
*   If Vampire Lord is supposed to be Special Summoned, but your Standby Phase is skipped with Solomon’s Lawbook or Gamble, Vampire Lord won’t be Special Summoned, not even on the following Standby Phase.
*   If Vampire Lord is supposed to be Special Summoned, but gets returned to your hand or Deck instead, he won’t be Special Summoned.
*   If Vampire Lord is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by your opponent’s card effect, but returns to the field that same turn and is then destroyed in a manner that would not allow him to be Special Summoned, then he is not Special Summoned.
*   You can keep Special Summoning Vampire Lord as long as each time he is destroyed by your opponent’s card effect.
*   Vampire Lord is Special Summoned to your side of the field; you cannot Special Summon him to your opponent’s side of the field.
*   When you have your Vampire Lord in play, Special Summoned by your Premature Burial or Call of the Haunted, and your opponent destroys Premature Burial or Call of the Haunted with Mystical Space Typhoon, the Vampire Lord won’t be Special Summoned because it was destroyed by your card effect, not by your opponent’s.
*   If your opponent controls your Vampire Lord with Autonomous Action Unit, and Autonomous Action Unit is destroyed, Vampire Lord won’t be Special Summoned because the owner did not control him.
*   When you Special Summon Vampire Lord with his effect, your opponent can negate the Special Summon with "Royal Oppression". Since the effect of "Vampire Lord" activates in the Graveyard, "Vampire Lord" is never moved from the Graveyard, so it is never destroyed. (A card already in the Graveyard cannot be destroyed). Because it is not destroyed, its effect to Special Summon itself does not activate again.
*   If Vampire Lord is destroyed while equipped to Relinquished, he won’t be Special Summoned, no matter who controls him or who destroyed him.
*   If Vampire Lord is destroyed while face-down by Sasuke Samurai, Vampire Lord will be Special Summoned by his effect.
*   Vampire Lord can be Special Summoned by his own effect even while Necrovalley is in play.
*   When Vampire Lord is Summoned while your opponent’s Rivalry of Warlords is active and your only monsters are non-Zombie, Vampire Lord is destroyed, but is not considered destroyed by Rivalry of Warlords’ effect and won’t be Special Summoned.
*   When your opponent doesn’t have the type of card that you declared for Vampire Lord, the effect of Vampire Lord disappears but you get to look at your opponent’s Deck to confirm it.
*   It is the controller of Vampire Lord, not necessarily the owner, that names a card type.
*   When you name “Spell” for Vampire Lord, it includes Normal, Quick-Play, Field, Ritual, Continuous, and Equip Spell Cards, and the same is true for Traps.
*   Card effects like Penguin Knight, Sword of Deep-Seated, and Cockroach Knight will activate their effects when sent to the Graveyard by Vampire Lord’s effect.
