### Card Rulings

*   You can Normal Summon this card (from your hand). Doing so does not require the use of any tributes (unless this card's level is being treated as level 5 or higher (if it is treated as a level 5 or 6 monster, it requires 1 tribute. If it is being treated as a Level 7 or higher monster, it requires 2 tributes)).
*   If this card battles an Attack Position monster with less than this card's ATK, that opponent's monster is destroyed by battle, and the difference between this card's ATK and that monster's ATK is inflicted as Battle Damage to the opponent's LP. If their attacks were the same (even if both were 0), both are destroyed by battle (unless either was being affected by a card effect preventing either from being destroyed by battle), and neither player takes any Battle Damage. Conversely, if the opponent's monster had higher ATK than this card's, this card is instead destroyed by battle; the difference between those battling monsters' ATK points is instead inflicted to your LP as battle damage.
