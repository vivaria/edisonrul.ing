> ① If a monster would be Summoned, and there is no ongoing chain: Tribute 1 "Lightsworn" monster; negate the Summon, and if you do, destroy that monster.

### Card Rulings

● This card can't be used to negate monsters summoned via card effects. It must be used to negate "inherent" summons, such as Synchro Symmons, the Summon of "Machina Fortress", or "Cyber Dragon".
