### Card Text

> ① After a Counter Trap Card you control negates the activation of an opponent's card(s) or effect(s), you can Special Summon this card from your hand. ② Then activate the appropriate effects, based on the type of cards negated:
• Spell: Inflict 1500 damage to your opponent.  
• Trap: Select and destroy 1 card your opponent controls.  
• Effect Monster: Select 1 monster in your Graveyard and Special Summon it.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the hand.
    *   This effect cannot be activated during the Damage Step \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/70685-vandalgyon-the-dark-dragon-lord/)\].
    *   This effect activates AFTER a Chain resolves in which an opponent's card / effect was negated (as Chain Link 1+) by your Counter Trap Card (even if you drew this card during the Chain).
    *   If you have 2 or more "Van'Dalgyon the Dark Dragon Lord" (or "Voltanis the Adjudicator") in your hand when your Counter Trap Card negates your opponent's effect, you can only activate the effect of 1 "Van'Dalgyon the Dark Dragon Lord", even if you negate multiple card effects.
    *   If your opponent discards 1 Spell Card for "Magic Drain", you cannot activate this effect.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   If you activate multiple Counter Trap Cards in a single Chain, the last one to resolve is applied.
        *   Example: Your opponent activates "Card Destruction". You chain "Magic Jammer". Your opponent chains "Seven Tools of the Bandit". You chain "Curse of Royal". When the Chain resolves, "Magic Jammer" is your last Counter Trap Card that resolves and negates your opponent's "Pot of Greed", so you will be able to Special Summon "Van'Dalgyon the Dark Dragon Lord" and activate its "inflict 1500 damage" effect.
    *   If a Spell Card is negated, this effect inflicts Effect Damage.
    *   If a Trap Card is negated, this effect targets a (face-up / face-down) card your opponent controls.
    *   If a Monster Effect is negated, this effect targets a monster in the Graveyard. It is negated by "Necrovalley".
*   VS. "[Vanity's Call](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Vanity%27s_Call)": if this card negates multiple card effects controlled by your opponent, when you Special Summon "Van'Dalgyon the Dark Dragon Lord" you will activate each effect appropriate effect.
    *   Example: "Vanity's Call" negates your opponent's "Destiny Draw" and "Dark Bribe". Van'Dalgyon you will activate its "_inflict 1500 damage_" and "_destroy 1 card_" effects when Summoned. You can choose to have "_inflict 1500 damage_" be Chain Link 1 and "_destroy 1 card_" be Chain Link 2, or vice-versa.

### Card Rulings

*   You can only activate 1 Trigger Effect in your hand per chain.
(You can't activate the ① effect of this card more that once per chain, even if you have multiple copies in your hand).
*   The ① effect does not trigger when a Spell/Trap Effect is negated; it only triggers when the Spell/Trap itself is negated.
(Activating a Spell/Trap Card from your hand is a Card Activation. Activating the effect of a Spell/Trap which is already face-up on the field is an Effect Activation).
