# Volcanic Counter

> ① When you take Battle Damage while this card is in your Graveyard, remove it from play. Then, if there is a FIRE monster other than "Volcanic Counter" in your Graveyard, inflict damage to your opponent equal to the amount of Battle Damage you took.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation.
    *   This effect activates even if you do not have another FIRE monster in your Graveyard.
    *   There is no cost. "Volcanic Counter" is banished when this effect inflicts Effect Damage.
*   The ① effect does not activate if your Life Points were reduced to 0 in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.
