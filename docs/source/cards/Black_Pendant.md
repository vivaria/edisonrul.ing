# BLACK PENDANT

*   If this card is destroyed while face-down, it still does damage to your opponent.
*   If this cardâ€™s activation is negated, such as with "Magic Jammer" or "Riryoku Field" it does not do damage to your opponent.
*   "Black Pendant" activates in the Graveyard, so if it is destroyed when "Imperial Order" is on the field, it still does damage to your opponent.
*   You can chain to the activation of the effect of "Black Pendant" when it is sent to the Graveyard.
