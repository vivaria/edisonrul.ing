# Armory Arm

> ① Once per turn, you can equip this card to a monster OR unequip it to Special Summon this card in face-up Attack Position. ② While equipped to a monster by this effect, that monster gains 1000 ATK. ③ When the equipped monster destroys a monster by battle and sends it to the Graveyard, inflict damage to your opponent equal to the destroyed monster’s ATK.

*   The ① Ignition(-like) Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   If activated while in the monster zone, this is a Monster Card's effect.
    *   If activated while equipped, this is an Equip Spell Card's effect. This effect can't be activated if "Cold Wave" prevents you from activating Spell Card effects.
    *   This effect equips "Armory Arm" to a monster on the field (even monsters your opponent controls).
    *   If the target leaves the field before this effect resolves, "Armory Arm" is destroyed.
*   The ② Continuous-like Effect applies on the field, it is an Equip Spell Card's effect.
    *   "Cold Wave" will not prevent this Continuous-like Effect from applying.
*   The ③ Trigger-like Effect is mandatory, it is an Equip Spell Card's effect.
    *   This effect activates & resolves on the field, if this card leaves the field before this effect resolves: this resolves without effect.
    *   If "Cold Wave" prevents you from activating "_using_" Spell Card, you cannot activate this effect.
    *   Inflict Damage equal to the destroyed monster's ATK while face-up on the field (at the end of Substep 4 - Damage Calculation), even if it leaves the Graveyard before this effect resolves \[[REF](https://yugiohblog.konami.com/2010/05/top-4-feature-match-andrew-fredella-vs-steven-harris/)\].
        *   This ruling changed in January 2011, inflicing damage equal to the original ATK \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=20342358&postcount=3)\].
*   VS. "Colossal Fighter": Player A equips "Armory Arm" to Player B's "Archfiend Soldier", bringing its ATK to 2900. Player A"'sColossal Fighter" (ATK/2800) attacks "Archfiend Soldier" (ATK/2900), and Player A takes 100 Points of damage in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation. In Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step, Player A activates the mandatory Trigger-like Effect of "Armory Arm" (as Chain Link 1) and the optional Trigger Effect of "Colossal Fighter" (as Chain Link 2, targeting itself). When the Chain resolves, "Colossal Fighter" Special Summons itself, then "Armory Arm" deals 2800 Points of Effect Damage to Player B.
