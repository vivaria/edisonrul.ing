# MIND TRUST

*   You can Tribute a face-down monster to pay the cost of “Mind Trust.” This effect targets 1 Tuner in your Graveyard.
*   Calculate the appropriate Level based on the Tributed monster’s Level as it was on the field.
*   Round down. If you Tribute a Level 5 monster (for example) you can add a Level 1 or 2 Tuner to your hand, but not a Level 3.
