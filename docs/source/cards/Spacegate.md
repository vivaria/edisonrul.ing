# SPACEGATE

*   Placing a "Gate Counter" onto "Spacegate" does not start a Chain.
*   Sending "Spacegate" to the Graveyard is a cost to activate its second effect.
*   If "Royal Decree" is chained to the second effect of "Spacegate", "Spacegate"'s effect is negated because the effect activated on the field.
