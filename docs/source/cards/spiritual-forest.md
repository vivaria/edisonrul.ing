# SPIRITUAL FOREST

*   If the effect of “Spiritual Forest” is resolved once during a turn, it cannot be resolved again even if “Spiritual Forest” is negated and then stops being negated in the same turn.
*   If a face-down Beast-Type, Beast-Warrior-Type, or Plant-Type monster you control is attacked and flipped face-up by battle, the effect of “Spiritual Forest” is applied.
*   You do not choose when to activate this effect.
*   It automatically activates the first time the appropriate type of monster would be destroyed.
