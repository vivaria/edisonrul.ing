# Robbin' Goblin

> Each time a monster you control inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent, your opponent discards 1 random card.

*   This is a mandatory effect. It activates even if your opponent has no cards in hand.
*   This effect will not activate if you inflict 0 Battle Damage.
*   This effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation (like "Don Zaloog").
