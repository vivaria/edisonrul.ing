### Card Rulings

*   Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon's first effect is a Continuous Effect. Its second effect is an optional Trigger Effect.
*   The monster destroyed in battle by Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon must be a Zombie-Type monster both on the field and in the GY. If DNA Surgery is active, with Zombie-Type chosen, and a Non-Zombie-Type monster is destroyed in battle by Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon, Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon's effect does not activate because the monster reverts to a Non-Zombie-Type monster in the GY.
*   When your Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon attacks and destroys your opponent's Pyramid Turtle in battle, if both effects are activated, Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon's effect is Chain Link 1 and Pyramid Turtle's effect is Chain Link 2.
