### Card Text

> ① Once per turn, select 1 monster your opponent controls and equip it to this card (only 1 monster can be equipped to it at a time). ② This card's ATK and DEF become equal to the ATK and DEF of the monster equipped to this card. ③ If this card is destroyed by battle, the equipped monster is destroyed instead, and any battle damage you received from the battle is also inflicted to your opponent.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Ignition Effect targets a (face-up / face-down) monster your opponent controls.
*   The target will become equipped even if it is flipped face-down / face-up.
*   If the target changes control before this effect resolves, it is not equipped to "Relinquished".
*   This effect cannot target "Blindly Loyal Goblin", etc...
*   The equipped (face-down) monster is treated as an Equip Spell Card, until it leaves the field.
*   The equipped target occupies a Spell / Trap Card Zone on "Relinquished"'s owner's side of the field.
*   Equipped Token monsters have 0 ATK / 0 DEF \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=173743)\], and are destroyed by "Token Thanksgiving".
*   If "Plaguespreader Zombie" Special Summoned by its own effect becomes equipped while face-up, it will be removed from play when it leaves the field from the Spell / Trap Card Zone.
*   If "Relinquished" equips itself with a Union Monster, it gains none of the Union Monster's bonuses.
*   The equipped monster is treated as a Monster Card when it is destroyed / leaves the field.
*   You can not voluntarily destroy a monster equipped to "Relinquished".
*   VS. "Skill Drain": equipped Monsters are destroyed when "Relinquished" loses the effect that allows it to be equipped with a monster, and its ATK/DEF are returned to normal.
*   The ② Continuous Effect does not activate.
*   This effect only applies while a monster is equipped by the ① effect.
*   "Shield & Sword" has no effect because "Relinquished"'s original ATK/DEF are both zero.
*   The ③ Continuous Effect applies while "Relinquished" is equipped with a monster by the ① effect.
*   It applies in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation before any chain is built.
*   This can occur when “Relinquished” battles another Attack Position Monster, or when it attacks a Defense Position monster with DEF higher than its current ATK.
*   The equipped monster is not treated as being 'destroyed by battle'.
