# Raiza The Storm Monarch

> ① When this card is Tribute Summoned, return 1 card on the field to the top of its owner's Deck.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Trap Hole").
    *   This effect targets 1 (face-up / face-down) card anywhere on the field.
    *   If the target is a Spell / Trap Card and it is chained, it is sent to the Graveyard when the chain resolves. Only a chained Continuous Trap Card will be returned to the top of the owner's Deck.
*   "[Monarch](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Monarch)"'s Trigger Effects are Spell Speed 1 and activate at the time they are successfully Tribute Summoned. If the opponent wants to activate a card like "[Bottomless Trap Hole](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Bottomless_Trap_Hole)", it will be placed onto the chain after the "[Monarch](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Monarch)"'s effect. But "[Monarchs](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Monarch)" don't need to remain on the field to resolve their effects, so destroying them with "[Bottomless Trap Hole](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Bottomless_Trap_Hole)" will not negate their effect
