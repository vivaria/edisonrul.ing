# Reptilianne Hydra

*   This effect activates even if your opponent controls more monsters with 0 ATK than you have cards in your Deck. In this case, you will lose the Duel due to not being able to draw enough cards. The destruction of the 0 ATK monsters and drawing cards are considered to occur simultaneously.
