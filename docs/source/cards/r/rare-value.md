# Rare Value

*   If there are no “Crystal Beast” cards in Spell & Trap Card Zone when this card resolves, you cannot draw 2 cards.
*   If there is only 1 “Crystal Beast” card in your Spell & Trap Card Zone when this card resolves, that card is sent to the Graveyard and you draw 2 cards.
*   If "Macro Cosmos" or "Banisher of the Raidance" is on the field, you can still activate "Rare Value", but since the "Crystal Beast" card is not sent to the Graveyard you do NOT draw 2 cards.
