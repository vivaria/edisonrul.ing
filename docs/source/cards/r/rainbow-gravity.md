# Rainbow Gravity

*   A "Rainbow Dragon" or "Rainbow Dark Dragon" in the Graveyard that was not first properly Special Summoned cannot be Special Summoned with "Rainbow Gravity".
*   If an effect is chained that reduces the number of "Crystal Beast" monsters with different names to 6 or less, "Rainbow Gravity"'s effect still resolves.
