# Rocket Pilder

*   This effect activates at the end of the Damage Step and starts a Chain. If a monster’s ATK is reduced by “Rocket Pilder” and then is affected by “Shrink,” the ATK of the monster becomes half of the original ATK.
*   If “Rocket Pilder” is negated after it reduces a monster’s ATK, that monster’s ATK does not go back to normal.
*   If “Rocket Pilder” is destroyed after it reduces a monster’s ATK, that monster’s ATK does not go back to normal.
*   Even if the equipped monster destroys its attack target, “Rocket Pilder’s” effect starts a Chain.
