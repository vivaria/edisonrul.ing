# Royal Oppression

> ① Either player can pay 800 Life Points to negate the Special Summon of a monster(s), and/or an effect that Special Summons a monster(s), and destroy those cards.

*   The ① Quick-like Effect activates & resolves on the field, so long as this card is face-up.
    *   This Card / Effect can't be activated in the Damage Step.
    *   Paying 800 Life Points is a cost.
    *   This effect can be used when "Royal Oppression" is activated (flipped face-up) \[[REF](https://web.archive.org/web/20090211060949/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1263911.aspx)\].
    *   This effect can activate in the Summon negation timing (like "Black Horn of Heaven") \[[REF](https://web.archive.org/web/20090211060949/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1263911.aspx)\].
    *   This effect can activate in response to the activation of a Card / Effect that would perform a Special Summon (ex: "Debris Dragon", "Miracle Fusion", "Call of the Haunted") \[[REF](https://web.archive.org/web/20090211060949/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1263911.aspx)\].
    *   This effect can negate the effect of a card that, when intially activated, might perform a Special Summon (Ex: "Macro Cosmos", "Future Fusion", and "Starlight Road") \[[REF1](https://web.archive.org/web/20090211060949/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1263911.aspx), [REF2](https://web.archive.org/web/20080827211228/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1264284.aspx)\].
    *   This effect can negate the activated effect of a card that would result in a Special Summon (like "Geartown", "Black Garden", "Future Visions") \[[REF1](https://web.archive.org/web/20090211060949/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1263911.aspx), [REF2](https://web.archive.org/web/20080827211228/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1264284.aspx)\].
    *   A Trap Monster, activated while "Imperial Custom" applies, whose effect to Special Summon itself is negated "Royal Oppression" stays in the Spell / Trap Card Zone meaninglessly \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board//showthread.php?p=14930312)\].
*   If "Royal Oppression" is activated (flipped face-up) but its Quick-like Effect was not activated, it cannot be activated in that same chain, since the card itself has not yet resolved.

### Card Rulings

● You can't activate this card, nor activate its effect, in the Damage Step.
(You can't use it to negate Tragoedia, Giant Rat, etc)
● You can use it against cards that could special summon, even if they might not.
(This means that you can use it to negate Macro Cosmos or Starlight Road)
● You can activate this card’s effect the moment it is activated (flipped face-up).
However, until it has finished resolving, it’s effect can’t be activated again that chain.
(For example, if this card is activated (flipped face-up), and the opponent chains “Call of the Haunted” to the activation, this same card’s effect can’t be used to negate that Call of the Haunted, as this card has not finished resolving)
