### Card Text

> ① Negate the effects of Effect Monsters destroyed by battle with Zombie-Type monsters you control.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate. It also applies to "Revived King Ha Des".
    *   This effect CANNOT be negated by "Divine Wrath", but CAN be negated by "Skill Drain".
    *   This effect does not apply if "DNA Surgery" changes to your Zombie-Types into non-Zombie-Types.
*   Monster destroyed by battle are marked for destruction at the end of Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.
    *   Effects that activate in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation are negated.
    *   Effects that activate in Substep 6 - Resolve Effects are negated (ex: "Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter" and "D.D. Warrior Lady").
    *   Effects that activate in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step are negated (ex: "Mystic Tomato", "Zoma the Spirit").
    *   Effects that activate in the Graveyard are negated; such as "Treeborn Frog", "Plaguespreader Zombie", "Sinister Serpent". The negation is reset if these cards are removed from the Graveyard.
    *   This effect does not affect monsters destroyed as substitutes such as "Six Samurai" monsters, or if "Relinquished" would be destroyed by battle while equipped with "Sangan".
*   If your "Revived King Ha Des" or other Zombie-Type monster destroys "Tyrant Dragon" as a result of battle, a Dragon-Type monster must still be Tributed when "Tyrant Dragon" is Special Summoned from the Graveyard. This is because Tributing a Dragon-Type monster is a condition on the Summoning of the card; it is not part of the effect. For the same reason, if a Spirit Monster is destroyed by a Zombie-Type monster when "Revived King Ha Des" is on the field, it still cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard.
