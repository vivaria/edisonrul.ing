### Card Text

> FLIP: Ⓐ You can destroy 1 card on the field. Ⓑ Send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard.

### Card Rulings

*   The Flip Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   If flipped in the Damage Step, this effect activates in Substep 6 - Resolve Effects.
    *   This effect resolves sequentially: Ⓐ destroy the target (if once was selected), then Ⓑ mill the top 3 cards of your Deck.
    *   If you want to destroy 1 card, target 1 card (face-up / face-down) on the field at activation.
    *   Milling 3 cards from the top of your Deck is always the last thing to happen. This can cause some effects to miss their activation timing (such as "Geartown" and "Dimensional Alchemist").
*   Example: Player A Flip Summons "Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter" and targets Player B's "Dimensional Alchemist". First, "Dimensional Alchemist" is destroyed, and afterwards Player A sends the top three cards of their deck to the Graveyard, among which was "Peten the Dark Clown". The last thing to happen was Player A sending the top three cards of their Deck to the Graveyard. Alchemist's trigger effect has missed its activation timing, but Peten may activate its effect.

Therefore, the language used and the consequences of this erratum are essential to authentic Edison Format play.
