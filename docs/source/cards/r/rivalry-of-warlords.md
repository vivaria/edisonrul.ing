### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① Each player can only control 1 Type of monster.
> Send all other face-up monsters they control to the GY.

### Card Rulings

While you control a face-up monster, you can:
*   Tribute Summon a monster using your only face-up monster, even if it has the wrong Type.
(EG: Your only face-up monster is "Treeborn Frog". You can Tribute it for "Caius the Shadow Monarch").
*   Take control of an opponent's monster with EG "Brain Control", even if it has the wrong Type.
(If it has the wrong Type, it's immediately sent to the GY).
*   Summon/Set monsters face-down, even if they have the wrong original Type.
*   If you control no monsters, you can Summon multiple monsters with different Types with EG "Rekindling".
(After they're summoned, send monsters you control to the GY so that you only control 1 Type).

While you control a face-up monster, you can't:
*   Ritual/Fusion/Synchro Summon a monster with the wrong Type, even if you would use the monsters you control as tribute/material.
(EG, you can't use 2 Sea-Serpents to Synchro Summon a Psychic).
*   Flip/Normal/Special Summon a monster with the wrong Type.
*   Summon "Lava Golem" (unless all monsters your opponent controls are Fiends).
*   Summon "Uria, Lord of Searing Flames" (unless you control no monsters, or only Pyros).

If a Set Monster is attacked:
*   It's not sent to the GY until After Damage Calculation.
*   Its Flip Effect will activate, but it is not "destroyed by battle"
(EG, Shura and Mystic Tomato won't trigger, since nothing was destroyed by battle).

### Card Text

> Each player sends monsters they control to the Graveyard so that they only control 1 Type of monster. Each player can only control 1 Type of monster.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies immediately after this Trap Card’s activation resolves: both players look at the face-up monsters they control and each choose 1 Type to keep and send their face-up monsters that aren’t that Type to the Graveyard.
*   If a face-down with a different Type is attacked, it is flipped face-up in Substep 2 - Flip Face-Down, and is sent to the Graveyard at the start of Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation. Flip Effects will still activate, but effects that trigger when the monster is destroyed by battle will not.
*   While this effect applies, and you control a face-up monster, YOU CANNOT:
*   Flip / Normal / Special Summoning a monster of a different Type.
*   Ritual Summon a monster of a different Type by Tributing the face-up monster(s).
*   Fusion/Synchro Summon a monster of a different Type using the face-up monster(s) as Material.
*   Tribute your opponent's monsters to Summon "Lava Golem", UNLESS they are all Fiend-Type.
*   While this effect applies:
*   You can Tribute Summon a monster of any Type by Tributing your only face-up monster(s). Konami's reversal of this ruling was delivered months after SJC Edison \[[REF](https://web.archive.org/web/20120427230353/http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/gameplay/card_faq1.html)\].
*   You can Set / Tribute Set / Special Summon monsters face-down of any Type.
*   You can activate and resolve "Creature Swap" & "Brain Control". If an exchanged monster's Type differs from those already face-up on that field, it is immediately sent to the Graveyard.
*   You can activate cards that Summon multiple monsters (if you have no face-up monsters). All of them are Summoned, then you pick one Type and send all others to the Graveyard.
*   VS. "Gladiator Beasts": Your Glad Beasts can tag out (return to your Deck) as long as there is another Gladiator Beast in your Deck of the correct Type that you COULD Summon. However, if you have no face-up monsters when the effect resolves, you can Summon a Glad Beast of any Type.
*   VS. Uria, Lord of Searing Flames: You cannot Special Summon Uria by sending Rivalry + 2 face-up Continuous Traps to the Graveyard unless you control no face-up monsters Pyro-Type monsters.
