### Card Rulings

*   This card can be chained to the activation of a Flip Effect from a Flip Summon to negate the Flip Effect. It cannot be activated during the Damage Step, so if a Flip Effect Monster is flipped face-up when attacked you cannot chain "Royal Command" to negate its Flip Effect.
*   If "Royal Command" is active on the field both players may still Flip Summon monsters, but any Flip Effects are negated.
