# Royal Decree

> Negate the effects of all other Trap Cards on the field.

*   Trap Cards (and their effects) can still be activated (played face-up).
*   This effect negates the effects of Trap Cards that activate & resolve on the field.
    *   The effect of a Trap Card sent by a chained "[Emergency Provisions](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Emergency_Provisions)" is still negated.
*   This effect does not negate the effects of Trap Cards that activate in the Graveyard (like "Dark Coffin").

> ① Negate all other Trap Effects on the field.

### Card Rulings

● Trap Effects don't leave the field even if the physical card leaves the field. For example:
If "Jar of Greed" is activated, and "Mystical Space Typhoon" is chained, targeting that Jar of Greed,
while this card's effect is applying, "Jar of Greed" is still negated, even though the card is in the GY.
