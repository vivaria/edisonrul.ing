*   The +1000 ATK lasts as long as "Raging Flame Sprite" remains face-up on the field. "Raging Flame Sprite" can continue to get +1000 ATK each time it successfully attacks directly (becoming ATK 1100, then ATK 2100, etc.).
*   The effect of "Raging Flame Sprite" is a Continuous Effect that cannot be chained to.
*   The effect of "Raging Flame Sprite" is resolved after damage calculation and before Flip Effects are resolved (so the timing is the same as "Don Zaloog" and "Airknight Parshath").
*   If "Raging Flame Sprite" is equipped with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light – Tryce", its ATK will increase by 1000 points after each successful attack ("Raging Flame Sprite" must still deal at least 1 point of damage with each attack for its effect to apply). So the second attack will be with +1000 ATK, and it will gain another +1000 ATK after the completion of the second attack.
