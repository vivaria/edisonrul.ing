### Card Text

> As long as this card remains face-up on the field, the control of all monsters on the field returns to the original owners.

### Card Rulings

*   The Continuous-like Effect does not activate.
    *   Monsters like "Lava Golem" return to their owner's side of the field.
    *   Monsters revived with "Autonomous Action Unit" return to their owner's side of the field.
    *   Monsters taken with "Exchange" and played normally return to their owner's side of the field.
    *   If a player already has 5 monsters on the field, the returning monsters are destroyed. If multiple monsters are return to their owner while there aren't enough open monster card zones, the player who controlled the monsters chooses which are destroyed and which return.
*   The effect DOES NOT:
    *   affect Monster Cards treated as Equip Spell Cards (ex: Union Monsters, "Armory Arm", etc.).
    *   affect "Blindly Loyal Goblin" which is under your opponent's control.
    *   prevent activation of cards / effects that change control of a monster (ex: "Creature Swap").
        *   Control is changed but then control goes back to the original owners. This means that if you give control of "Griggle" or "Ameba" to your opponent, their effect IS activated even though "Griggle"/"Ameba" then returns to the original owner's control afterwards.
    *   cause control to revert if "Remove Brainwashing" is destroyed. (ex: "Remove Brainwashing" is destroyed after "Mind Control" has resolved. Control does NOT revert control of the monster to the player who activated "Mind Control").
*   VS. "[Black Garden](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Black_Garden)": Player A Normal Summoned a monster, causing a "Rose Token" to be Special Summoned to Player B's field. Player A is the owner of that "Rose Token". "Remove Brainwashing" will cause Player A to gain control of that "Rose Token".
*   VS. "[Vengeful Servant](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Vengeful_Servant)": if the equipped monster changes control, it will immediately switch back before the effect of "Vengeful Servant" can activate. Afterwards, "Vengeful Servant" will activate once, and inflict damage to the equipped monster's current controller: its original owner.
*   When your opponent activates "Autonomous Action Unit" and Special Summons your Synchro Monster to his field, if "Remove Brainwashing" is on the field, then the monster is still considered to have been Special Summoned to your opponent's field, even though it is now on your side of the field. Thus, you can activate the effect of "Shiny Black "C" to destroy the Synchro Monster, even though it is on your side of the field.
