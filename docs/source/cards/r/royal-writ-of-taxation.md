### Card Rulings

*   If the selected card is a Monster Card, the card (or 1 with the same name) has to be Normal Summoned for “Royal Writ of Taxation’s” effect to apply. If it is Set, Special Summoned, or Flip Summoned then the effect will not apply.
*   “Activated” in the text of “Royal Writ of Taxation” means to activate a Spell or Trap Card, or to activate the effect of a Spell, Trap, or Effect Monster. So a face-down “Ojamagic” being destroyed, the effect of an already face-up “Ultimate Offering” being activated, or the Flip Effect of a “Magician of Faith” activating would all cause “Royal Writ of Taxation’s” effect to be applied.
