### Card Rulings

*   If a card gives a monster +100 ATK, and "Reverse Trap" is activated, that monster now has -100 ATK instead. This card only affects increases and decreases of a defined value, such as +200 (which becomes -200) or -500 (which becomes +500). It does not change cards which "double", "half", or "reduce to 0" the ATK or DEF of a monster.
*   You cannot activate this card during the Damage Step. This card affects monsters, Spell Cards, and Trap Cards controlled by both players.
*   Additional "Reverse Traps" activated in the same turn will have no effect. So "Reverse Trap" will change "Axe of Despair’"s effect of adding 1000 ATK to subtracting 1000 ATK. If a second "Reverse Trap" is activated, the equipped monster still has -1000 ATK.
