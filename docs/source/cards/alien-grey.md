# Alien Grey

> FLIP: Place 1 A-Counter on 1 face-up monster on your opponent's side of the field. (① If a monster with an A-Counter battles an "Alien" monster, it loses 300 ATK and DEF for each A-Counter during damage calculation only.) ② After this card has been flipped face-up, when it is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, draw 1 card.

*   The Flip Effect is mandatory.
*   The ① Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   If this card is not on the field, a monster with an A-Counter won't lose ATK when battling an "Alien".
    *   If 2 "Alien Grey" (or other monsters with the A-Counter text) are on the field, then a monster with 1 A-Counter will lose 600 ATK while battling an "Alien".
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   The effect to draw a card when "Alien Grey" has been flipped face-up is activated even if it had been flipped face-up earlier in the Duel (including Flip Summoned or being changed face-up by a card effect). It does not have to be flipped face-up as a result of the battle that destroyed it.
