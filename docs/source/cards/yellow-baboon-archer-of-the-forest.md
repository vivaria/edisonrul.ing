# Yellow Baboon, Archer Of The Forest

> ① When a Beast-Type monster you control is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, you can remove from play 2 Beast-Type monsters in your Graveyard to Special Summon this card from your hand.
  

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the hand.
    *   Removing from play 2 Beast-Type monsters in your Graveyard is a cost \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?p=16906277)\].
    *   The Beast-Type monster destroyed by battle must be on your side of the field (under your control).
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
*   This effect will not trigger:
    *   if your opponent controls one of your Beast-Type monsters (by "Creature Swap").
    *   the Beast destroyed by battle leaves the field by an effect (like "Red Dragon Archfiend").
    *   the Beast destroyed by battle is removed from play (by "D.D. Warrior Lady").
    *   the Beast destroyed by battle is removed from play by "Macro Cosmos".
