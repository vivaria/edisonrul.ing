# URGENT SYNTHESIS

*   Returning 1 “Iron Core of Koa’ki Meiru” to the Deck is a cost to activate “Urgent Synthesis.” The effect does not target. You cannot activate “Urgent Synthesis” while “Transmigration Break” is active, as you cannot pay the cost to return “Iron Core of Koa’ki Meiru” to the Deck.
