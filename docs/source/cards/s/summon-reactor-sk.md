# Summon Reactor Sk

*   The effect that inflicts damage can activate even during the Damage Step.
*   If “Magical Dimension” Summons a monster and destroys “Summon Reactor ・SK”, then 800 damage is not inflicted to the opponent.
*   But if “Magical Dimension” destroys a different monster instead, then “Summon Reactor ・SK” will inflict the 800 damage. If your “Summon Reactor ・SK” is Summoned at the same time as an opponent’s monster (example: “Dimension Fusion”), then it will not inflict 800 damage to the opponent at that time.
*   The effect that negates attacks activates when the attack is declared, and targets the attacking monster.
*   If the effect of “Summon Reactor ・SK” that inflicts 800 damage is negated by “By Order of the Emperor”, you cannot later use its effect to negate an attack that turn.
