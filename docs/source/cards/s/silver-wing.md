*   If a monster equipped with “Silver Wing” is equipped with “Blast Sphere” and would be destroyed during the Standby Phase, both “Blast Sphere” and “Silver Wing” are destroyed but the monster is not and no damage is inflicted.
*   If “Silver Wing” and the monster it is equipped to would be destroyed by a card effect simultaneously, you can't use the effect of “Silver Wing.”
*   Multiple copies of “Silver Wing” are not accumulative.
*   Equipping two copies of “Silver Wing” to a single monster protects the monster from being destroyed by battle twice per turn, not four times.
