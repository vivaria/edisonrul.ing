> ① If a monster attacks, at the end of the Damage Step: Its controller gains 300 LP.
> ② All Attack Position monsters must attack if able.
> ③ During each End Phase: Destroy all Attack Position monsters the turn player controls that did not declare an attack this turn.

### Card Rulings

If an attacking monster is removed from the field before the end of the Damage Step, the ① does not activate.
*   The effect to destroy monsters activates every End Phase even if there aren’t any monsters on the field. It only activates once each End Phase.
*   If an attack is negated (eg, by XX-Saber Fulhelmknight or Negate Attack), that monster did not declare an attack and will be destroyed by the ③.
*   If an attack is stopped but not negated (eg, Gravity Bind was activated in response to the attack), that monster did declare an attack and won't be destroyed by the ③.
