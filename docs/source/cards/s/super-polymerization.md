# Super Polymerization

*   "Super Polymerization" does not target. The Fusion Material Monsters are sent to the Graveyard when "Super Polymerization" resolves.
    *   After Fusion Materials are removed from the field, the last thing to happen is the Fusion Summon.
*   "Super Polymeriation" prevents effects from being chained, but Continous Effects are still applied.
*   If "Super Polymerization" is activated while "Light and Darkness Dragon" is face-up on the field, "Light and Darkness Dragon"'s effect does not activate.
*   If "Super Polymerization" is activated while "Spell Absorption" is active, the player who controls "Spell Absorption" gains Life Points.
