### Card Text

> When the effect of a DARK monster activates on the field or in the Graveyard, negate it.

### Card Rulings

*   When determining if a monster’s effect should be negated by “Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror”, check the monster’s Attribute at the time its effect is resolved.
*   When a Non-DARK monster’s effect is activated while the monster and “Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror” are both face-up on the field, if you chain “DNA Transplant” and select “DARK”, the monster’s effect will be negated if the monster is still face-up on the field when its effect resolves because it is now a DARK monster.
*   “Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror” cannot negate Unclassified or Continuous Effects of DARK monsters.

### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① If the effect of a DARK monster is activated on the field/GY, negate that effect.

### Card Rulings

*   This doesn't stop monster effects from activating.
It just negates any effect which does activate (on the field/GY).
*   Even if the Physical card is no longer on the field/GY, the effect is still negated.
If the monster is face-down when its effect resolves, the effect is still negated
