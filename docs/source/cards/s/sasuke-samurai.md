# Sasuke Samurai

*   If "Sasuke Samurai" attacks a face-down monster, apply its effect after entering the Damage Step, but before flipping up the face-down monster. The monster is not flipped. Flip Effects are not activated. Monsters like "Kisetai" and "Giant Axe Mummy" do not activate their effects.
*   If "Sasuke Samurai" attacks a face-down monster, there is no damage calculation. "Sasuke Samurai" destroys the monster before damage calculation is reached.
*   If "Sasuke Samurai" destroys a face-down monster using its effect, the face-down monster is NOT "destroyed as a result of battle", it is destroyed by "Sasuke Samurai"’s effect. So "Mystic Tomato", "Helpoemer", etc. will not activate their effects. However, monsters like "Sangan" will still activate their effects.
*   If "Sasuke Samurai" attacks a face-down monster, and "Ceasefire" is activated during the Battle Step to flip it face-up, "Sasuke Samurai" does not destroy it with its effect and damage calculation is applied normally. The monster must be face-down at the beginning of the Damage Step in order for "Sasuke Samurai" to activate its effect.
