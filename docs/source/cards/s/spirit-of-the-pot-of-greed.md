*   Spirit of the Pot of Greed's effect does not chain to Pot of Greed; instead, you activate it after Pot of Greed resolves.
*   Spirit of the Pot of Greed must be face-up on the field to resolve its effect; if Book of Moon is chained to Pot of Greed or to the effect of Spirit of the Pot of Greed, Spirit of the Pot of Greed's effect is negated.
*   If Imperial Order negates the effect of Pot of Greed, Spirit of the Pot of Greed's effect still activates because Pot of Greed's activation was not negated.
