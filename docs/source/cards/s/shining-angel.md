# Shining Angel

*   If you attack with your "Shining Angel" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you may attack with the monster Special Summoned by "Shining Angel" before entering Main Phase 2.
*   If your opponent controls your "Shining Angel" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you get the effect of "Shining Angel" NOT your opponent.
*   Since the Special Summoning occurs during the Damage Step, "Torrential Tribute", etc. cannot be used.

### Card Rulings

● This effect activates in the Damage Step, so it can never be negated by "Royal Oppression".
Cards like "Bottomless Trap Hole" and "Torrential Tribute" can never be used in response to this Summon.
