### Card Rulings

*   Changing this card to Defense Position and sending cards to your opponent’s GY are both parts of the same Trigger Effect.
*   They occur one after the other, so you would miss the timing to activate “Tragedy.”
*   If you Special Summon this card with “Limit Reverse” you will switch it to Defense Position, send cards from your opponent’s Deck to the GY, and then destroy “Shield Worm” with “Limit Reverse.”
