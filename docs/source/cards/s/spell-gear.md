### Card Rulings

*   'Ancient Gear' cards means any card you control that has Ancient Gear in its card name.
*   You can't activate Spell Gear if you don't have any Ancient Gear Golem remaining in your Deck.
*   If an effect is chained that prevents you from Special Summoning Ancient Gear Golem, you still can't Normal Summon or Set until the end of your next turn.
*   The effect that prohibits Normal Summons or Sets until the end of your next turn is not a restriction on this card’s activation. So you can activate this card if you Normal Summoned earlier in the turn. But you can't Normal Summon or Set after it is activated.
