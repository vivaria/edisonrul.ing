### Card Text

> Activate only when an effect is activated that would destroy 2 or more cards you control. Negate the effect and destroy that card. Then, you can Special Summon 1 “Stardust Dragon” from your Extra Deck.

### Card Rulings

*   This card can be activated when an effect would destroy 2(+) cards on the field simultaneously, even if some cards would be unaffected (ex: "Elemental Hero Wildheart" is unaffected by "Torrential Tribute").
    *   This card cannot be activated if an effect would only destroy 1 card you control (ex: "Celestia, Lightsworn Angel" / "Gladiator Beast Gyzarus" only targets 1 card with its effect).
    *   This card cannot be activated if an effect is not guaranteed to destroy 2(+) cards (ex: "Timewizard").
*   This card only negates card effects, it does not negate the activation of effects.
    *   This card cannot activate in the Damage Step.
*   This effect resolves sequentially. First, negate the effect and destroy that card, then (if "Starlight Road" destroyed that card) you can Special Summon 1 "Stardust Dragon" from your Extra Deck. Resolve the rest of the chain afterwards.
    *   VS. "Torrential Tribute": since "Starlight Road" does not negate the activation of the card / effect, "Torrential Tribute" can never be activated after the Chain because the Special Summon of "Stardust Dragon" was not the last thing to happen, the card / effect negated by "Starlight Road" resolved negated later in the Chain.
*   If this card negates the effect but does not destroy that card, you cannot Summon "Stardust Dragon".
    *   Example: Player A activates "Heavy Storm" and chains "Starlight Road" (Chain Link 2), Player B activates "Mystical Space Typhoon" (Chain Link 3) targeting "Heavy Storm". "Mystical Space Typhoon" destroys "Heavy Storm", "Starlight Road" negates the effect of "Heavy Storm" but didn't destroy it (Player A can't Summon "Stardust Dragon"), and "Heavy Storm" resolves negated.
    *   Example: Player A Synchro Summon "Black Rose Dragon" and activates its effect to destroy all cards on the field. Player B activates "Starlight Road". Resolving the chain: "Starlight Road" negates the effect of "Black Rose Dragon" and destroys it, Player B chooses to Special Summon 1 "Stardust Dragon", finally then the effect of "Black Rose Dragon" resolves negated. Player A cannot activate "Torrential Tribute" at this time, because "Stardust Dragon" was Summoned as Chain Link 2(+).

### Card Rulings

How chains work:
*   When a card/effect is activated, the activator's opponent is the first to be able to add to the chain. If they decline, the activator can then add to the chain.
*   Road must be chained directly to the card/effect that would destroy 2+ cards you control. If Torrential Tribute is CL1, and Jar of Greed is CL2, Starlight Road cannot be CL3.
*   If you activate "Heavy Storm", and your opponent doesn't chain anything to Storm, and 2+ of your cards (excluding Storm itself) would be destroyed, you can chain this card.

Vs effects that might not destroy 2+ cards:
*   You can only activate Road if it is certain that 2+ cards you control would be destroyed.
*   Road can never be chained to the effect of "Elemental HERO Stratos".
*   Road can never be chained to the effect of "Saber Slash" (unless your opponent controls no face-up cards and you control at least 2 "X-Saber" monsters).
*   This can be activated even if the cards that would be destroyed are unaffected by card effects. If you control 2 “Tenkabito Shien”, and “Torrential Tribute” is activated, you can still activate this card.

On Summoning Stardust Dragon:
*   If the effect is not negated or the card is not destroyed, you can't Summon Stardust.
*   Cards which are in the Deck, GY, or Banished, can't be destroyed. If "Heavy Storm" is activated, and Road is chained, and "Twister" is chained, targeting Storm, Storm's effect will be negated by Road, but Stardust won't be Summoned (Storm wasn't destroyed by Road).
*   This card does not Synchro Summon. If Stardust Dragon summoned this way is later sent to the GY/banished, it can’t be Summoned again by any means.
