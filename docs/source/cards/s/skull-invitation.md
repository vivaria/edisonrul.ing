# Skull Invitation

*   Cards that are Tributed or Discarded are included, because they are also "sent to the Graveyard".
*   The effects of multiple "Skull Invitation" are cumulative.
*   If "Dark Hole" destroys monsters controlled by both players, the damage from "Skull Invitation" is applied to both players simultaneously.
*   If you draw the final piece of "Exodia" with "Graceful Charity" and have all 5 pieces of "Exodia" in your hand after discarding, you win the Duel even if the damage resulting from "Skull Invitation" would reduce your Life Points to 0.
