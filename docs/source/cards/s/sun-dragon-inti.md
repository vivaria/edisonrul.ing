*   Destroying the monster that destroyed this card does not target. Special Summoning “Moon Dragon Quilla” does target.
*   The effect to Special Summon “Moon Dragon Quilla” activates even if “Sun Dragon Inti” is not in the Graveyard during the Standby Phase as long as there is a “Moon Dragon Quilla” in the Graveyard.
*   If “Sun Dragon Inti” is on the field or in the Extra Deck during the Standby Phase then its effect to Special Summon “Moon Dragon Quilla” activates and “Divine Wrath” is Chained, the effect is negated but “Sun Dragon Inti” is not destroyed.
*   Destroying your opponent’s monster and dealing damage happen at the same time. The damage is half of the monster’s ATK on the field.
*   The effect to Special Summon “Moon Dragon Quilla” does not activate in any specific place, regardless of where “Sun Dragon Inti” is at the time. “Light Imprisoning Mirror” cannot negate it.
