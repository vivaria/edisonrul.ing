### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① If this card is flipped face-up: Target 1 face-up monster on the field; destroy that target.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① triggers when this card is flipped face-up, so it will trigger when attacked while face-down, when flipped face-up by a card effect, or when Flip Summoned.
*   This effect does not say 'You can', so it is a mandatory effect. If Snowman Eater is Flip Summoned and there are no other face-up monsters on the field, it must still activate and must target itself.
*   If this Set card is attacked, and is destroyed by that battle, this card can't target itself.
*   If the target isn't face-up when this effect resolves, it is not destroyed. You can read more about that here: https://edisonformat.net/rules/compendium/both-those-them
