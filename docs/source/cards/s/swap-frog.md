# Swap Frog

> Ⓢ You can discard 1 WATER monster to Special Summon this card from your hand. ① When this card is Summoned, you can select and sent 1 Level 2 or lower Aqua-Type WATER monster from your Deck or your side of the field to the Graveyard. ② Once per turn, you can return 1 monster you control to the hand to Normal Summon 1 “Frog” monster, except “Swap Frog” or “Frog the Jam”, in addition to your Normal Summon or Set this turn.

*   TheⓈ Summon Effect does not start a chain.
    *   Discarding 1 WATER monster is a cost.
*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect can be activated multiple times per turn.
    *   This effect cannot activate if this card is Summoned as Chain Link 2(+) (by "Call of the Haunted").
*   The ② Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Returning 1 monster you control (even itself) to the hand is a cost. You CANNOT return a Fusion / Synchro Monster to the Extra Deck as cost, nor can you return a "Battle Fader" / "Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord" Special Summoned by its effect as it is banished instead.
    *   This effect can be activated with Ignition Effect Priority in response to this card's Summon if the ① optional Trigger Effect isn't activated.
    *   This effect can only be used once while each copy of "Swap Frog" is face-up on the field.
    *   You only gain 1 extra Normal Summon by this effect in a turn.
    *   The additional Normal Summon can be used before your regular Normal Summon / Set of that turn.
    *   The additional Normal Summon / Set IS cummulative with "Double Summon".
    *   You can activate this effect again this turn, even if you have already performed the additional Normal Summon (ex: you Special Summoned "Swap Frog" later that turn) \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=1044244)\].
    *   VS. "Doomcaliber Knight": If "Swap Frog" uses this effect and returns itself to the hand as cost, "Doomcaliber Knight" will tribute itself to negate the effect, but it will not destroy "Swap Frog" since it is considered a different card in the hand (not the same card that activated the effect on the field).
