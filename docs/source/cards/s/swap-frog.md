### Card Rulings

*   TheⓈ Summon Effect does not start a chain.
    *   Discarding 1 WATER monster is a cost.
*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect can be activated multiple times per turn.
    *   This effect cannot activate if this card is Summoned as Chain Link 2(+) (by "Call of the Haunted").
*   The ② Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Returning 1 monster you control (even itself) to the hand is a cost. You CANNOT return a Fusion / Synchro Monster to the Extra Deck as cost, nor can you return a "Battle Fader" / "Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord" Special Summoned by its effect as it is banished instead.
    *   This effect can be activated with Ignition Effect Priority in response to this card's Summon if the ① optional Trigger Effect isn't activated.
    *   This effect can only be used once while each copy of "Swap Frog" is face-up on the field.
    *   You only gain 1 extra Normal Summon by this effect in a turn.
    *   The additional Normal Summon can be used before your regular Normal Summon / Set of that turn.
    *   The additional Normal Summon / Set IS cummulative with "Double Summon".
    *   You can activate this effect again this turn, even if you have already performed the additional Normal Summon (ex: you Special Summoned "Swap Frog" later that turn) \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=1044244)\].
    *   VS. "Doomcaliber Knight": If "Swap Frog" uses this effect and returns itself to the hand as cost, "Doomcaliber Knight" will tribute itself to negate the effect, but it will not destroy "Swap Frog" since it is considered a different card in the hand (not the same card that activated the effect on the field).

### Card Rulings

The Ⓢ:
*   Discarding 1 WATER monster for this card’s Ⓢ is a cost.
*   This does not start a chain.

The ①:
*   You can send a monster you control to the GY, so if you activate this effect and then realize that you have nothing in your Deck to send, you must send an appropriate monster you control to the GY.

The ②:
*   Returning a monster to the hand is a cost, so you cannot return a Fusion/Synchro Monster.
*   If Swap leaves the field, and is Summoned again that same turn, it can be activated again.
*   Even if it resolves more than once, you can't gain more than 1 additional Summon this way (but the cost of returning a monster is still paid).
*   You can return an opponent's monster to the hand. If you do, it returns to its owner's hand.

The Frog Summon:
*   You may use the additional Summon before your normal Normal Summon.
*   Summons are not Sets. You can't Set a Frog with your Extra Summon.
