# Soul Absorption

*   "Soul Absorption"'s effect is based on the number of cards, not on each "lump sum" of cards. So if 3 DARK monsters are removed from the Graveyard to Special Summon "Dark Necrofear", the controller of "Soul Absorption" gains 1500 Life Points.
*   However, you receive the Life Points from "Soul Absorption" as a "lump sum", so in the case of "Dark Necrofear" you gain 1500 Life Points but your "Fire Princess" would only do 500 points of damage.
*   "Soul Absorption" is a "trigger-like" Continuous Spell Card, not a "continuous-like" Continuous Spell Card, so activate its effect after the current chain resolves that includes removing cards from play.
*   The effect of "Soul Absorption" can, itself, be chained to after it activates.
*   If "Soul Absorption"'s effect activates in response to the Special Summon of a monster like "Dark Necrofear" or "Inferno", Soul Absorption's effect activates after the monster is Special Summoned.
*   For "Chaosrider Gustapth", activate "Soul Absorption"'s effect after "Chaosrider Gustaph"'s effect resolves.
*   Your "Soul Absorption"'s effect activates even when your opponent's cards are removed.
