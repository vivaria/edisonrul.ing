### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① While this card is face-up on the field, it can't be Tributed.
> ② If this card is Normal/Flip Summoned: Change it to Defense Position.
> ③ Once per turn: You can discard 1 Spell; Special Summon 1 Level 4 monster from your Deck (but that monster can't attack this turn).

### Card Rulings

● The ① is a continuous effect. It can be negated.
● The ② is a mandatory effect. When this card is summoned, the ② must trigger, and you don't retain Ignition Priority (you must wait until it has resolved before you can activate the ③).
