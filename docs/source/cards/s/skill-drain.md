### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> © Activate this card by paying 1000 LP.
> ① The effects of face-up monsters on the field are negated.

### Card Rulings

*   This only negates the effects of monsters while they remain face-up on the field.
If a monster activates its effect on the field, but isn't face-up on the field when that effect resolves (EG, Lonefire Blossom tributing itself), that effect is not negated.

### Card Text

> Pay 1000 Life Points. ① The effects of all face-up Effect Monsters are negated.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect does not activate.
*   Paying 1000 Life Points is a cost.
*   Face-up Effect Monsters may still activate their effects and pay costs.
*   Negate all effects of face-up Effect Monsters that activate / apply as long as that monster is face-up. This includes Unclassified Effects that apply on the field (like "Tuningware").
*   If an Effect Monster is not face-up on the field when its effect resolves, the effect is not negated.
*   Maintenance costs (ex: "Armor Exe") must still be paid.
*   Conditions (which are not effects) and Lingering Effects are not negated.
*   Spell Counters cannot be held by Monsters (ex: "Skilled Dark Magician"), remove all Spell Counters.
*   VS. "Jinzo": Whichever card was face-up first applies its effect.
