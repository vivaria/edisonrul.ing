### Card Rulings

*   If “Searchlightman’s” Flip Effect is activated, and then later “Cyber Jar’s” Flip Effect is activated, all appropriate monsters picked-up by your opponent will have to be Special Summoned in face-up Attack Position.
*   After “Searchlightman’s” effect has resolved, your opponent could not Normal Summon “Mystic Swordsman LV4” or LV6 because they have to be Normal Summoned in face-down Defense Position, which is considered a Set.
*   If your opponent attacks your face-down Defense Position “Searchlightman” with “Inferno Hammer”, the Flip Effect will resolve before it is sent to the Graveyard, so the effect of “Inferno Hammer” cannot activate.
