# Stumbling

> Any monster that is Normal Summoned, Flip Summoned, or Special Summoned is changed to Defense Position.

*   The mandatory Trigger-like Effect always starts a Chain in the Summon response timing, even if the monster was Summoned by a card effect as Chain Link 2(+).
*   This effect activates as soon as a monster is successfully Summoned (or simultaneously with any mandatory Trigger Effects) before optional Trigger Effects ("Red Gadget") or chained Spell / Trap Cards (Trap Hole). This supersedes Ignition Effect Priority.
    *   Example: Player A controls "Stumbling" and a set "Trap Hole". Player B Normal Summons "Exiled Force". "Stumbling’s" mandatory Trigger-like Effect immediately starts a chain as Chain Link 1. Player B CANNOT claim 'priority' to activate "Exiled Force’s" effect, but activates "Mystical Space Typhoon" as Chain Link 2 targeting "Stumbling". Player A responds by activating "Trap Hole" as Chain Link 3. When resolving the chain, "Trap Hole" destroys "Exiled Force", then "Mystical Space Typhoon" destroys "Stumbling" and the chain is considered resolved (as "Stumbling" is longer face-up on the field to allow for Chain Link 1 to resolve). The last thing to happen in this case was the destruction of "Stumbling".
