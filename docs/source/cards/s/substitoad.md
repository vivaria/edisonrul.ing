### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① You can tribute 1 monster; Special Summon 1 "Frog" monster from your Deck.
> ② "Frog" monsters can't be destroyed by battle.

### Card Rulings

*   Like all ignition effects, this card's effect can be activated whenever you summon a monster. When you summon Substitoad, you can activate its effect using your ignition priority. When the "frog" monster is summoned, Substitoad's effect can be activated again, using your ignition priority.
*   The ② applies to both players' "frog" monsters. If "Treeborn Frog" attacks an Attack Position Substitoad, the Treeborn Frog is not destroyed by battle, but Substitoad is.
*   Tributing a monster is a cost. If you Tribute "Dupe Frog", Dupe's effect can't be activated.
