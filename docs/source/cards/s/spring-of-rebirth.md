# Spring Of Rebirth

*   Only the controller of "Spring of Rebirth" gains Life Points by its effect. If you control "Spring of Rebirth", you gain Life Points even when a monster is returned to your opponent’s hand.
*   You gain 500 Life Points each time a monster or monsters on the field are returned to their owner’s hand. So if "Penguin Soldier" returns two monsters at once, you only gain 500 Life Points.
*   Spirit Monsters are sent to the owner’s hand one at a time during the End Phase. So if you have 4 face-up Spirit Monsters during the End Phase, you will gain 500 Life Points for each, totaling 2000 Life Points.
*   Multiple "Spring of Rebirth" cards are cumulative.
