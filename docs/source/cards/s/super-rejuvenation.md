### Card Rulings

*   This effect counts monsters that were Dragon-Type when Tributed / Discarded.
    *   Monsters treated as Dragon-Type (by "DNA Surgery") that are Tributed are still counted.
    *   Dragon-Types Tributed on the field while "Zombie World" is active are not counted.
    *   Your opponent's Dragon-Types Tributed by "Soul Exchange" are still counted.
    *   Dragon-Types Tributed / Discarded from hand while "Zombie World" applies are still counted \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=767781)\].
*   The Ⓛ Lingering Effect resolves during the End Phase without starting a chain.
    *   This effect is cumulative. If multiple copies of "Super Rejuvenation" are activated in the same turn, you resolve each one at a time during the End Phase.
*   If "Solemn Wishes" is active, you will gain 500 for every card you draw. If you draw 3 cards then you gain 1500 Life Points.
*   You CANNOT activate this card while your opponent controls "Protector of the Sanctuary".
*   You CANNOT activate this card in the Damage Step.
*   You CANNOT activate this card after discarding for hand limit in the End Phase, as it is the very last action that occurs in a turn.
    *   Cards / Effects CANNOT activate beyond this point unless discarding triggers a mandatory effect. Only Counter Trap Cards and mandatory effects may activate in the resulting Chain.
    *   Example: It is Player A's End Phase and they have a Set "Divine Wrath" from a previous turn. Player A discards two copies of "The White Stone of Legend" to bring their hand size down to 6 cards. However, "The White Stone of Legend" has a mandatory Trigger Effect to add a "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" from the Deck to the hand, and Player B controls a "Doomcaliber Knight". Thus, a chain is built with both "The White Stone of Legend"'s effects forming a chain as Chain Links 1 and 2, and "Doomcaliber Knight" Tributing itself as Chain Link 3. Player A activates "Divine Wrath" as Chain Link 4 and discards a card as cost. When resolving the chain, "Divine Wrath" will successfully negate the effect of "Doomcaliber Knight", then both effects of "The White Stone of Legend" will add a copy of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" to Player A's hand (should any remain in the Deck). Once the chain has resolved, no chains may be built (unless mandatory Trigger/Trigger-like Effects were activated) and Player A must once again discard down to their hand limit and the turn ends.
