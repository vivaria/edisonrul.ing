### Card Text

> Negate the activation of an Effect Monster's effect that activates when a monster is Special Summoned (including itself), and destroy it.

### Card Rulings

*   This effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Archlord Kristya").
*   If a monster effect activates in response to a Special Summon (ex: "King Tiger Wanghu"), you can activate this card.
*   This effect does not target.
*   When a Special Summoned monster activates its effect (ex: “Archlord Kristya”) while “Light and Darkness Dragon” is face-up, the effect of the Summoned monster will be Chain Link 1 and “Light and Darkness Dragon” will be Chain Link 2. Therefore, “Swallow Flip” cannot activate as it cannot negate the effect of the Special Summoned monster.
*   This card cannot be activated in response to an Ignition Effect activated in the Summon response timing via Ignition Effect Priority.

### Card Rulings

This card can only negate trigger effects which specifically activate when a monster is Special Summoned.
*   It can negate the effects of cards like "Swap Frog", "Armageddon Knight", or "King Tiger Wanghu" (for all 3 examples, this card can only be activated when a monster is Special Summoned).
*   It can't negate Ignition effects, even if activated with ignition Priority.
It can never negate the effect of "Substitoad", "Dark Grepher", nor "D.D. Crow".
*   It can't negate an effect which activated because a monster was Normal Summoned, even if that monster's effect states "if this card is Normal/Special Summoned".
