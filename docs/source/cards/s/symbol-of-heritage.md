### Card Rulings

*   “Symbol of Heritage” targets 1 monster in the Graveyard. If your opponent chains “Disappear” to remove from play the targeted monster, the effect of “Symbol of Heritage” does not resolve. But if they chain “Disappear” to remove a different monster with the same name, then the targeted monster is still Special Summoned even though there are now only 2 of it in the Graveyard.
