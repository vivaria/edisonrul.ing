    *   This effect can activate when exactly 1 Synchro Monster is Synchro Summoned or when it is Special Summoned by an effect (by "Call of the Haunted" or "Blackwing - Vayu the Emblem of Honor").

*   VS. “Remove Brainwashing”: If you Special Summon your opponent’s Synchro Monster with “Monster Reborn,” control of the monster is immediately shifted to your opponent.

### Card Rulings

*   This Quick Effect activates in your GY, banishes this card for cost and targets the Special Summoned Synchro Monster.

*   It cannot be activated during the Damage Step (e.g. vs "Colossal Fighter").

*   If the summoned Synchro Monster is face-down when this effect resolves, it is not destroyed (e.g. vs "Book of Moon").

*   You cannot activate this effect if two or more Synchro Monsters are special summoned to your opponent's field simultaneously.

*   When a Synchro Monster is Special Summoned to your opponent's field while this card is in your hand, it you discard this card for cost (e.g. for "Raigeki Break"), you can then chain the effect of this card.
