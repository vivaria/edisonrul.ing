### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> When a monster you control is destroyed by a card effect and sent to the GY (except during the Damage Step): Pay 1000 LP; Special Summon 1 level 4 monster from your Deck.

### Card Rulings

You can't use this card in the Damage Step (so you can't activate it when a monster is destroyed by battle).
