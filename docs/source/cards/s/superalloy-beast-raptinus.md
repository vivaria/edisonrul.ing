*   When “Doom Shaman’s” effect is activated to Special Summon 1 Fiend-Type monster while “Superalloy Beast Raptinus” is face-up on the field, if “Superalloy Beast Raptinus” is removed from the field or flipped face-down “Doom Shaman” will be treated as a Normal Monster again, but the Fiend-Type monster is still Special Summoned.
*   When “Chthonian Emperor Dragon” declares its second attack during the Battle Phase while “Superalloy Beast Raptinus” is face-up on the field, if “Superalloy Beast Raptinus” is removed from the field or flipped face-down “Chthonian Emperor Dragon” will be treated as a Normal Monster and its attack will stop because it no longer has an effect allowing it to attack twice during the Battle Phase.
