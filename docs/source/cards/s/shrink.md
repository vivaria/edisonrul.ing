### Card Text

> Select 1 face-up monster on the field. The original ATK of that monster is halved until the end of this turn.

### Card Rulings

*   This card can be activated during the Damage Step, before Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.
*   This effect target's 1 face-up monster anywhere on the field.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down / leaves the field, it is no longer applied.
    *   This effect refers to the target's original (printed) ATK. Multiple copies of "Shrink" achieve nothing.
    *   After the target's ATK is halved by "Shrink", apply ATK changes from card effects (ex: Equip Spell Cards, Field Spell Cards).
    *   If the target's ATK varies due to a Continuous Effect (ex: "Gren Maju Da Eiza"), that monster’s ATK will be halved. If its ATK changes due to its own effect in the same turn, recalculate the effect of "Shrink" based on the new original ATK. When the effect of “Shrink” wears off, that monster’s ATK will be calculated as normal.
    *   If the target's ATK is set by its effect when it is Summoned (ex: "Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"), its ATK becomes "0", and remains "0" even after the effect of “Shrink” wears off.
*   VS. "Megamorph": If the same monster is targeted by both, the effect that resolved last is applied.

### Card Rulings

*   VS "Card Trooper"/"Exarion Universe" (ATK/DEF increase/decrease applying only to itself):
Half it's original ATK, then reapply the ATK/DEF increase/decrease from it's effect.
(The Upper Deck Entertainment ruling does not apply to Edison Format)

*   VS "Blackwing - Sirocco the Dawn"/"Rush Recklessly" (ATK/DEF increase/decrease, can apply to other cards):
Half the original ATK, then reapply the ATK/DEF increase/decrease from the effect.

*   VS "Tragoedia" (0 original ATK, gains ATK):
Shrink has no effect (0 is halved to 0, then it immediately regains its ATK for each card in hand).

*   VS "Chimeratech Fortress Dragon" (ATK is set once it is summoned):
Chimeratech's ATK becomes 0 permanently.

*   VS "Gren Maju Da Eiza" (original ATK becomes a value):
Halve its ATK. If the number of banished cards changes, it becomes halved based off of that new value.

*   VS Equip Spell Cards:
Halve the original ATK, then apply any changes from the Equip Spell Cards.
