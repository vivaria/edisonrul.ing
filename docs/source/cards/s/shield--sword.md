### Card Rulings

*   You can use this card with "Catapult Turtle". In this case, inflict Direct Damage equal to half of the Tribute monster's original DEF to your opponent's Life Points.
*   This card switches the original ATK/DEF only. After this, apply all modifiers to the new ATK/DEF.
*   The effect of this card lasts for your turn only.
*   This card has no effect on "Relinquished" because "Relinquished"'s original ATK/DEF are both zero.
*   If "Shrink" affects a monster affect by "Shield & Sword" after "Shield & Sword"'s effect is applied, its ATK will be half of the switched ATK (ie., half of its original DEF). If "Shield & Sword"'s effect is applied after "Shrink"'s, that monster's ATK will become equal to its original DEF, and its original DEF will be equal to its original ATK (The effect of "Shrink" effectively disappears).
