### Card Rulings

*   If you Tribute Summon this card by Tributing a “Batteryman” monster, this card’s Trigger Effect can be chained to. After the Trigger Effect resolves, “Voltech Dragon” then has the appropriate effect applied to it. So if you Tributed “Batteryman D”, the opponent may activate “Trap Hole” as a chain to the effect of “Voltech Dragon” and destroy “Voltech Dragon” before it can negate the effects of Spell & Trap Cards that target it. (In other words, by chaining to the effect that would give “Voltech Dragon” immunity, you can destroy it before it becomes immune.)
*   You can activate “Divine Wrath” when this card is Tribute Summoned if a “Batteryman” monster was Tributed.
