### Card Text

> Activate only while you control a face-up "X-Saber" monster. Negate the Summon of a monster, and destroy it.

### Card Rulings

*   You must control a face-up XX-Saber or X-Saber monster in order to activate this card.
*   This card activates in the Summon negation timing (like “Horn of Heaven” and “Black Horn of Heaven”).
*   This effect does not target.
*   This can negate Normal Summons, Flip Summons, Special Summons (like "Chaos Sorcerer"), Synchro Summons, and Contact Fusion Summons (like "Gladiator Beast Gyzarus").
*   This can negate the Summon performed after an effect resolves as Chain Link 1 (ex: "Ultimate Offering").
*   This cannot negate effects that perform a Special Summon (ex: "Polymerization", "Blackwing - Vayu the Emblem of Honor").
