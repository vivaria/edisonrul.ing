*   “Shield Crush” can select and destroy monsters in face-up or face-down Defense Position.
*   “Shield Crush” will only destroy the selected monster if the selected monster is still in Defense Position when “Shield Crush” is resolved. For example, if you select a Defense Position monster to destroy with “Shield Crush” and the monster is changed into Attack Position by another card effect (“Zero Gravity”, etc.), the effect of “Shield Crush” disappears.
*   “Shield Crush” targets the Defense Position monster that is selected when you activate “Shield Crush”. If the selected monster is changed into Attack Position after being selected, it is not possible to select a different monster.
