### Card Text

> Pay half of your Life Points. ① Negate an activation of a Spell / Trap Card / Normal Summon / Flip Summon / Special Summon and destroy the Spell Card, Trap Card, or Summoned monster.

### Card Rulings

*   Paying half your Life Points is a cost. If this results in a fraction, your Life Points are rounded up.
*   "Solemn Judgment" does not target the card it will destroy.
*   NEGATE the activation (playing face-up on the field) of a Spell / Trap Card.
    *   DO NOT negate activated effects of Spell / Trap Cards (ex: "Royal Oppression", "Geartown").
*   NEGATE the Normal / Flip / Tribute / Special Summon of a monster (ex: "Chaos Sorcerer, "Gladiator Beast Gyzarus", a Synchro Summon) that did not start a Chain.
    *   This occurs in the Summon negation timing (before the monster is successfully Summoned).
    *   Negate the Normal Summon from "Ultimate Offering"'s effect that resolved as Chain Link 1.
    *   DO NOT negate Monster Effects (ex: "Debris Dragon", "Dark Simorgh").
    *   DO NOT negate the Normal Summon from "Ultimate Offering" / "Mausoleum of the Emperor".
    *   DO NOT negate the Fusion Summon after "Polymerization" resolved.
    *   DO NOT negate the Synchro Summon after "Urgent Tuning" resolved.

### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① If a monster(s) would be Summoned,
> OR if a Spell/Trap Card is activated: Pay half your LP; negate the Summon/Activation, and if you do, destroy it.

### Card Rulings

This effect can't negate monster effects that start a chain, even if that effect would special summon a monster.
For example, it can't negate Gorz, The Emissary of Darkness' effect.
