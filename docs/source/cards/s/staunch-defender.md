# Staunch Defender

*   This card only affects face-up Attack Position monsters on your opponent's side of the field that can attack.
*   Activating the card causes a replay.
*   Monsters Special Summoned during the Battle Phase after activation of "Staunch Defender" must also attack the monster selected by "Staunch Defender".
*   If your monster selected with "Staunch Defender" is destroyed, your opponent's remaining monsters cannot attack.
*   When your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to your "Staunch Defender" to destroy the selected monster, the effect of "Staunch Defender" is negated and battle is conducted normally.
*   While "Staunch Defender" is active, your opponent must still pay costs to attack with "Dark Elf", etc., if he/she attacks with that monster.
*   You cannot select "Guardian Kay'est" or "The Legendary Fisherman" for "Staunch Defender" if they cannot be attacked.
*   You can activate "Staunch Defender" when a monster affected by "Diffusion Wave Motion" declares an attack. The monster affected by "Diffusion Wave Motion" will then attack your selected monster once (and only once).
*   When you select "Spirit Reaper" or "The Reaper on the Nightmare" as the target of "Staunch Defender", resolve the chain, and after the effect of "Staunch Defender" resolves, the selected monster is destroyed. A replay will occur, but the opponent can no longer attack because the selected monster is gone.
*   If two "Staunch Defenders" are activated during the same turn, the last one to resolve will be the one that applies.
*   If "Absolute End" and "Staunch Defender" are both activated during the same turn, the last one to resolve will be the one that applies.
