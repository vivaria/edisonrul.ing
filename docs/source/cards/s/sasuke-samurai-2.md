### Card Rulings

*   If Sasuke Samurai attacks a face-down monster, apply its effect after entering the Damage Step, but before flipping up the face-down monster. The monster is not flipped. Flip Effects are not activated. Monsters like Kisetai and Giant Axe Mummy don't activate their effects.
*   If Sasuke Samurai attacks a face-down monster, there is no damage calculation. Sasuke Samurai destroys the monster before damage calculation is reached.
*   If Sasuke Samurai destroys a face-down monster using its effect, the face-down monster is NOT destroyed as a result of battle, it is destroyed by Sasuke Samurai’s effect. So Mystic Tomato, Helpoemer, etc. won't activate their effects. However, monsters like Sangan will still activate their effects.
*   If Sasuke Samurai attacks a face-down monster, and Ceasefire is activated during the Battle Step to flip it face-up, Sasuke Samurai does not destroy it with its effect and damage calculation is applied normally. The monster must be face-down at the beginning of the Damage Step in order for Sasuke Samurai to activate its effect.
