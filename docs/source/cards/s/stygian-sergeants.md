### Card Rulings

● “It can attack again in a row” means that this card can keep attacking until its condition to attack again is no longer fulfilled. It can make a second, third, fourth, etc attack this way.
● This card’s effect specifies “and sends it to the GY”. It triggers at the end of the Damage Step, but not if the destroyed monster wasn’t sent to the GY, or if this card is no longer face-up on the field.
