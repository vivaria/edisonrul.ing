# CONFUSION CHAFF

*   This card does not target.
*   When "Confusion Chaff" resolves, the battle caused by "Confusion Chaff" proceeds directly to the Damage Step.
*   This card cannot be activated when a single monster like “Hayabusa Knight”, etc., makes its second direct attack in the same Battle Phase.
*   If the first monster that attacked directly is face-down when “Confusion Chaff” resolves, it is flipped face-up and damage calculation is conducted normally.
*   If a monster’s attack becomes a direct attack due to a replay, it is still considered to be the first monster that attacked directly for “Confusion Chaff”.
*   If a monster declares a direct attack, but that attack is negated, it will not be considered the first monster that attacked directly that turn.
*   If your “Amazoness Swords Woman” declares the second direct attack during a Battle Phase, and “Confusion Chaff” is activated, your opponent will take any battle damage from that battle.
