*   If "Zombyra the Dark" is selected with "Dark Spirit of the Silent" and you have no monsters, "Zombyra the Dark" may attack directly.
*   If "Hayabusa Knight" or "Mataza the Zapper" is selected with "Dark Spirit of the Silent" it only attacks once, but it may then attack twice per its own effect during the same Battle Phase.
*   Monsters that have a cost to attack such as "Dark Elf" that are selected with "Dark Spirit of the Silent" do not need to have their costs paid to attack.
*   If "Dark Spirit of the Silent" selects a face-up Defense Position "Crass Clown" as a target, the effect of "Crass Clown" activates when it is changed to Attack Position.
