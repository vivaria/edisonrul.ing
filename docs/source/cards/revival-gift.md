# Revival Gift

*   This card targets 1 Tuner monster in your Graveyard.
*   “Revival Gift” only negates the Tuner monster’s effects that activate on the field. If you Special Summon “Sinister Sprocket” and use it as a Synchro Material Monster, its effect will activate in the Graveyard.
*   The Tuner monster and 2 “Gift Fiend Tokens” are considered to be Special Summoned at the same time.
*   You cannot activate this card if your opponent has 1 or fewer empty Monster Card Zones.
*   If the targeted Tuner monster is no longer in your Graveyard when “Revival Gift” resolves, you still Special Summon 2 “Gift Fiend Tokens” to your opponent’s side of the field.
