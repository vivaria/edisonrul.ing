# DARK HORUS  
> ① Once per turn, when a Spell Card is activated during your opponent's Main Phase, you can Special Summon 1 Level 4 DARK monster from your Graveyard.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates AFTER a Spell Card's activation resolved (starting a new chain).
    *   This effect CAN miss the timing if Chain Link 1 was NOT the activation of a Spell Card.
    *   This effect WILL NOT trigger in response to the effect of face-up Spell Card (ex: "Black Garden").
    *   This effect WILL NOT trigger if "Dark Horus" is flipped face-down before it can activate its effect.
    *   This effect WILL NOT resolve if "Dark Horus" is flipped face-down before resolving its effect.
