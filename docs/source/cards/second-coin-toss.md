# Second Coin Toss

*   The effect of this card only applies when you perform a coin toss, not when your opponent performs a coin toss.
*   If an effect requires multiple coin flips, like "Barrel Dragon", you would redo all 3 coin flips.
*   Even if multiple "Second Coin Toss" cards are active, you can only redo each coin toss once.
*   Even if the original coin toss came out in your favor, you may use the effect of "Second Coin Toss" and redo the toss.
