# RIVALRY OF WARLORDS

> Each player sends monsters they control to the Graveyard so that they only control 1 Type of monster. Each player can only control 1 Type of monster.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies immediately after this Trap Card’s activation resolves: both players look at the face-up monsters they control and each choose 1 Type to keep and send their face-up monsters that aren’t that Type to the Graveyard.
    *   If a face-down with a different Type is attacked, it is flipped face-up in Substep 2 - Flip Face-Down, and is sent to the Graveyard at the start of Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation. Flip Effects will still activate, but effects that trigger when the monster is destroyed by battle will not.
*   While this effect applies, and you control a face-up monster, YOU CANNOT:
    *   Flip / Normal / Special Summoning a monster of a different Type.
    *   Ritual Summon a monster of a different Type by Tributing the face-up monster(s).
    *   Fusion/Synchro Summon a monster of a different Type using the face-up monster(s) as Material.
    *   Tribute your opponent's monsters to Summon "Lava Golem", UNLESS they are all Fiend-Type.
*   While this effect applies:
    *   You can Tribute Summon a monster of any Type by Tributing your only face-up monster(s). Konami's reversal of this ruling was delivered months after SJC Edison \[[REF](https://web.archive.org/web/20120427230353/http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/gameplay/card_faq1.html)\].
    *   You can Set / Tribute Set / Special Summon monsters face-down of any Type.
    *   You can activate and resolve "Creature Swap" & "Brain Control". If an exchanged monster's Type differs from those already face-up on that field, it is immediately sent to the Graveyard.
    *   You can activate cards that Summon multiple monsters (if you have no face-up monsters). All of them are Summoned, then you pick one Type and send all others to the Graveyard.
*   VS. "Gladiator Beasts": Your Glad Beasts can tag out (return to your Deck) as long as there is another Gladiator Beast in your Deck of the correct Type that you COULD Summon. However, if you have no face-up monsters when the effect resolves, you can Summon a Glad Beast of any Type.
*   VS. Uria, Lord of Searing Flames: You cannot Special Summon Uria by sending Rivalry + 2 face-up Continuous Traps to the Graveyard unless you control no face-up monsters Pyro-Type monsters.
