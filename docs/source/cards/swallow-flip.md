# SWALLOW FLIP  
> Negate the activation of an Effect Monster's effect that activates when a monster is Special Summoned (including itself), and destroy it.

*   This effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Archlord Kristya").
*   If a monster effect activates in response to a Special Summon (ex: "King Tiger Wanghu"), you can activate this card.
*   This effect does not target.
*   When a Special Summoned monster activates its effect (ex: “Archlord Kristya”) while “Light and Darkness Dragon” is face-up, the effect of the Summoned monster will be Chain Link 1 and “Light and Darkness Dragon” will be Chain Link 2. Therefore, “Swallow Flip” cannot activate as it cannot negate the effect of the Special Summoned monster.
*   This card cannot be activated in response to an Ignition Effect activated in the Summon response timing via Ignition Effect Priority.
