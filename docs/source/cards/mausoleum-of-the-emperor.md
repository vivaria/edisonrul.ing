# Mausoleum Of The Emperor

> ① Both players can Normal Summon or Set monsters without Tributing, by paying 1000 Life Points x the number of monsters needed for the Tribute Summon.

*   The ① Ignition-like Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Either player can use this effect on their respective turn.
    *   This effect is not an additional Normal Summon, but your one Normal / Tribute Summon for the turn may be performed without Tributing monsters.
    *   Paying 1000 or 2000 Life Points is a cost.
    *   You cannot pay 3000 Life Points to Normal Summon "Victory Dragon" or "Gilford the Lightning", so you cannot use this effect to Normal Summon "Obelisk the Tormentor" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=814931)\].
    *   The Normal Summoned monster (ex: "Caius the Shadow Monarch") was NOT Tribute Summoned.
    *   The Normal Summon CANNOT be negated by "Solemn Judgment" \[[REF](https://www.edisonformat.com/home/rules-update-when-not-immediately-after-this-effect-resolves)\].
    *   The Normal Summon can be responded to with "Torrential Tribute".
    *   You cannot use the effect of "Spell Economics" to activate this effect without paying Life Points.
    *   This effect cannot be used when resolving the effect of “Ultimate Offering”, because you cannot activate “Mausoleum of the Emperor’s” effect during the resolution of “Ultimate Offering’s” effect.
