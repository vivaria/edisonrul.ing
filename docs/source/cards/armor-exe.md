# Armor Exe

> ① This card cannot attack in the same turn it is Normal Summoned, Flip Summoned, or Special Summoned. Ⓜ During each of your and your opponent's Standby Phases, remove 1 Spell Counter on your side of the field. If you do not, this card is destroyed.

*   This card's name is pronounced "egg-zay".
*   The ① Continuous Effect applies the turn this card is Summoned.
    *   If you Summon "Armor Exe", flip it face-down with "Book of Moon", and flip it face-up with "Book of Taiyou", it CAN attack because its non-attack effect was reset AND because flipping it face-up with "Book of Taiyou" was NOT a Flip Summon.
    *   If "Skill Drain" is active and "Armor Exe" is Summoned, or if "Skill Drain" is activated after "Armor Exe" is Summoned, in both cases "Armor Exe" CAN attack the same turn it was Summoned.
*   The Ⓜ Maintenance Cost is not an effect, it can't be negated.
    *   Removing a Spell Counter from "Armor Exe" is a cost. If you can't do this, this card is destroyed immediately (this doesn't start a Chain).
