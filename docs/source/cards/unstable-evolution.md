# UNSTABLE EVOLUTION

*   "Unstable Evolution" changes the equipped monster's original ATK. If the equipped monster is targeted by "Shrink", its original ATK determined by "Unstable Evolution" is halved.
*   When determining the equipped monster's ATK, apply the effect of "Unstable Evolution" and then apply any other ATK gains and losses.
*   If the equipped monster gains 700 ATK with "Rush Recklessly" and afterwards "Unstable Evolution" is removed from the field or negated, etc., the monster's original ATK returns to normal and "Rush Recklessly" is reapplied.
*   If the equipped monster is also equipped with "Megamorph", first determine its new original ATK due to "Unstable Evolution" and then halve or double it with "Megamorph".
*   If "Unstable Evolution" is equipped to "King of the Skull Servants", "King of the Skull Servant"'s original ATK becomes the value determined by "Unstable Evolution". When "Unstable Evolution" is negated or removed from the field, "King of the Skull Servant"'s original ATK is determined by its effect.
*   If "Unstable Evolution" is equipped to "Megarock Dragon", its original ATK becomes the value determined by "Unstable Evolution". When "Unstable Evolution" is negated or removed from the field, "Megarock Dragon"'s original ATK is determined by its own effect.
*   If "Unstable Evolution" is equipped to a "Fusilier Dragon, the Dual-Mode Beast" that was Normal Summoned or Set without Tributes, its original ATK is determined by "Unstable Evolution". When "Unstable Evolution" is negated or removed from the field, "Fusilier Dragon, the Dual-Mode Beast"'s ATK becomes halved to 1400.
*   The monster equipped with "Unstable Evolution" is not destroyed by "Overworked", because "Unstable Evolution" changes the monster original ATK to a new value. The monster will be destroyed if another effect increases its ATK.
