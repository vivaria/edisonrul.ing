# "Dark World" Monsters (“Beiige, Vanguard Of Dark World”, “Broww, Huntsman Of Dark World”, “Sillva, Warlord Of Dark World” And “Goldd, Wu-Lord Of Dark World”).

> ① If this card is discarded from the hand to the Graveyard by a card effect, \[perform action 1\]. ① If this card is discarded from the hand to the Graveyard by an opponent’s card effect, \[perform action 2\].

*   These effects will not miss timing, they are mandatory effects.
    *   If discarded by a card effect in the middle of a chain, or in the middle of a card effect like “Dragged Down into the Grave”, these effects will activate after the current chain resolves.
*   "Dark World" monsters only meet their trigger condition when they are '_discarded_' to the Graveyard.
*   These effects activate in the Graveyard, so “Skill Drain” will not negate their effects.
*   These effects can activate in the Damage Step, if discarded by the effect “Don Zaloog”.
*   "Dark World" monsters DO NOT activate when:
    *   discarded as a cost. They only activate when discarded by \[resolving a\] card effect.
    *   they are removed from play instead of going to the Graveyard (by "Dimensional Fissure").
    *   they are '_sent_' (as opposed to '_discarded_') to the Graveyard by a card effect.
*   The ① Trigger Effect of a "Dark World" monster discarded by your card effect produces a single Chain Link which would \[perform action 1\].
*   If the ① Trigger Effect is activated when discarded by the effect of an opponent’s card, both parts of the effect resolves in a single chain link.
    *   If “Divine Wrath” is chained to these effects, it will negate both parts.
