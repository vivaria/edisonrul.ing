# MALEVOLENT MECH - GOKU EN  
> Ⓤ You can Normal Summon this card without Tributing. ① If you do, this card is sent to the Graveyard during the End Phase if it is the only Zombie-Type monster on the field. When it is sent to the Graveyard by this effect, you take damage equal to its ATK.

*   The Ⓤ Unclassified Effect does not activate, it applies in the hand.
*   The ① Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field in the End Phase.
    *   This effect ONLY activates & resolve is if it is the ONLY Zombie-Type monster on the field.
    *   This effect will activate during the End Phase of every turn (if this card was Normal Summoned with its \[U\] Unclassified Effect).
    *   If the activation of this effect is negated by "Light and Darkness Dragon", it will activate again in the same End Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
    *   If this effect resolves negated by "Skill Drain", it will not activate again in the same End Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
    *   This effect resolves without effect (Goku En is not destroyed) if an effect (like "Call of the Haunted") is chained that Summons an another Zombie-Type monster to the field face-up.
    *   This effect resolves sequentially: first, send this card to the Graveyard; then inflict effect damage.
    *   This effect inflicts damage equal to the original (printed) ATK of "Malevolent Mech - Goku En".
*   VS. "Creature Swap": If this card (Normal Summoned by its \[U\] Unclassified Effect) changes control and activates its effect in the End Phase, the controller of Goku En on the field (when it was destroyed) takes the damage \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=759277), [REF2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=764678)\].
