# TRAP STUN

> Negate the effects of all other Trap Cards on the field during this turn.

*   This effect does not prevent Trap Cards from being activated.
*   Negate any effect of a Trap Card that activates & resolves on the field.
*   After "Trap Stun" has resolved, if a Trap Card is activated and is removed from the field during the chain (by "[Emergency Provisions](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Emergency_Provisions)"), then the Trap Card will still be negated.
