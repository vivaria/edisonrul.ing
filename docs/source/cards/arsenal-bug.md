# Arsenal Bug

> ① If there are no face-up Insect-Type monsters (except this monster) on your side of the field, both the ATK and DEF of this monster become 1000 points.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   If you have 2 "Arsenal Bugs" on your side of the field, each has ATK 2000.
    *   If the only other Insect-Type monster you control is face-down, the ATK of "Arsenal Bug" is 1000.
    *   If the ATK of "Arsenal Bug" is 1000, and it is equipped with an Equip Spell Card or modified by a Field Spell Card, recalculate. So begin with the 1000 ATK, then increase or decrease from there according to other card effects.
    *   When "Arsenal Bug" is Summoned and there are no other Insect-Type monsters on your side of the field, "Bottomless Trap Hole" can't activate because its ATK is 1000 when Summoned.
    *   If you equip "Megamorph" to "Arsenal Bug" then its ATK will be 4000 or 1000, depending on "Megamorph"’s effect.
