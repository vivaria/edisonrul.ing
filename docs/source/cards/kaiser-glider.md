# KAISER GLIDER

*   The "same ATK" as "Kaiser Glider" means the same as the current ATK, not the original ATK.
*   When "Kaiser Glider" is in Attack Position and battles a monster with the same ATK, only the other monster is destroyed.
*   "Kaiser Glider"'s second effect activates when destroyed and sent to the Graveyard from the field, hand, or Deck.
*   If "Kaiser Glider" is equipped to "Relinquished" or "Thousand-Eyes Restrict", and is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, "Kaiser Glider"'s effect activates.
