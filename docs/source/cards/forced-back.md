# FORCED BACK

*   You cannot activate this card when a monster is Set.
*   If a monster with a Flip Effect is Flip Summoned and you activate “Forced Back”, then the Flip Effect never activates.
*   If you negate the Normal or Flip Summon of “Dark Magician of Chaos” with “Forced Back”, it is returned to the hand and is not removed from play.
*   You can activate “Forced Back” when you Normal or Flip Summon your own monster. You should announce this immediately after your Summon. Once you allow your opponent to activate “Torrential Tribute” you are acknowledging that the Summon was successful and you cannot activate “Forced Back”.
