# SHINING SILVER FORCE

*   You can chain “Shining Silver Force” to a Trap Card your opponent activates that inflicts damage to themselves.
*   If a Trap Card that normally gives Life Points has been changed to a damage card by “Bad Reaction to Simochi”, you can activate “Shining Silver Force”.
*   You cannot chain “Shining Silver Force” to a card if you’re not sure it will inflict damage or not (like “The Paths of Destiny).
*   You cannot chain “Shining Silver Force” to the activation of a card that does not inflict damage upon activation but will inflict damage in the future (like “Skull Invitation”).
*   You cannot chain “Shining Silver Force” to a card that shifts battle damage, like “Dimension Wall”.
