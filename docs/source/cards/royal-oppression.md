> ① Either player can pay 800 Life Points to negate the Special Summon of a monster(s), and/or an effect that Special Summons a monster(s), and destroy those cards.

*   The ① Quick-like Effect activates & resolves on the field, so long as this card is face-up.
    *   This Card / Effect can't be activated in the Damage Step.
    *   Paying 800 Life Points is a cost.
    *   This effect can be used when "Royal Oppression" is activated (flipped face-up) \[[REF](https://web.archive.org/web/20090211060949/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1263911.aspx)\].
    *   This effect can activate in the Summon negation timing (like "Black Horn of Heaven") \[[REF](https://web.archive.org/web/20090211060949/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1263911.aspx)\].
    *   This effect can activate in response to the activation of a Card / Effect that would perform a Special Summon (ex: "Debris Dragon", "Miracle Fusion", "Call of the Haunted") \[[REF](https://web.archive.org/web/20090211060949/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1263911.aspx)\].
    *   This effect can negate the effect of a card that, when intially activated, might perform a Special Summon (Ex: "Macro Cosmos", "Future Fusion", and "Starlight Road") \[[REF1](https://web.archive.org/web/20090211060949/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1263911.aspx), [REF2](https://web.archive.org/web/20080827211228/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1264284.aspx)\].
    *   This effect can negate the activated effect of a card that would result in a Special Summon (like "Geartown", "Black Garden", "Future Visions") \[[REF1](https://web.archive.org/web/20090211060949/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1263911.aspx), [REF2](https://web.archive.org/web/20080827211228/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1264284.aspx)\].
    *   A Trap Monster, activated while "Imperial Custom" applies, whose effect to Special Summon itself is negated "Royal Oppression" stays in the Spell / Trap Card Zone meaninglessly \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board//showthread.php?p=14930312)\].
*   If "Royal Oppression" is activated (flipped face-up) but its Quick-like Effect was not activated, it cannot be activated in that same chain, since the card itself has not yet resolved.
