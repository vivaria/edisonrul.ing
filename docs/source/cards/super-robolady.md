# Super Robolady

*   The effect of this card to Special Summon "Super Roboyarou" is Spell Speed 1 and can only be activated during your Main Phase 1 or 2.
*   A "Super Roboyarou" Special Summoned by this card’s effect is not considered properly Summoned. So if it is destroyed, you cannot target it with "Monster Reborn".
