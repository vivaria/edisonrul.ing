# VIRUS CANNON

*   Tributing monster(s) is a cost.
*   If you target your opponent's monster with "Soul Exchange", it can be Tribute to activate "Virus Cannon".
*   If the number of Spell Cards remaining in your opponent's Deck is less than the number of monsters you Tributed to activate "Virus Cannon", every Spell Card remaining in your opponent's Deck is sent to the Graveyard and your opponent must show you their Deck to verify.
*   You cannot Tribute a face-up "Jinzo" to activate "Virus Cannon" because "Jinzo"'s effect prevents Trap Cards from being activated.
*   Non-Monster Cards Special Summoned by the effect of "Magical Hats" can be Tributed to activate "Virus Cannon".
