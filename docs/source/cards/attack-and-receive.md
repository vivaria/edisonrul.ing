# ATTACK AND RECEIVE  
> You can only activate this card when you take damage to your Life Points. Inflict 700 points of damage to your opponent's Life Points. Also, inflict 300 points of damage to your opponent's Life Points for each "Attack and Receive" card in your Graveyard.

*   This card can be activated when the last thing to happen was inflicting Battle / Effect Damage.
    *   This can activate in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation, after adding Trigger Effects to the Chain.
    *   This effect resolves simultaneously: "_Inflict 700 points of damage to your opponent's Life Points_" and "_Also, inflict 300 points of damage to your opponent's Life Points for each "Attack and Receive" card in your Graveyard._" are considered to happen at the same time.
*   You cannot activate this card when you pay Life Points as cost.
*   You cannot activate this card when you take effect damage as Chain Link 2(+), or as the first part of an effect that resolves sequentially (like "Armored Axon Kicker").
