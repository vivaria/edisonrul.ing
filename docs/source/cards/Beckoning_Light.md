# BECKONING LIGHT  
> Discard all the cards in your hand, then select a number of LIGHT monsters in your Graveyard equal to the number of cards you discarded, and add them to your hand.

*   Discarding is not a cost.
*   "Beckoning Light" doesn't target. When you resolve "Beckoning Light", first discard, then pick cards to add to your hand. So you can add cards to your hand that you discarded while resolving "Beckoning Light".
*   You CANNOT activate "Beckoning Light" if you have no cards in your hand.
*   You CANNOT activate "Beckoning Light" if there are fewer LIGHT monsters in your Graveyard than there are cards in your hand, even if 1 or more of the cards in your hand are LIGHT monsters.
*   You can activate "Beckoning Light" while "Macro Cosmos" is active, but since no cards will be discarded to the Graveyard, you CANNOT add any LIGHT monsters from your Graveyard to your hand \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=982726)\].
*   If "Disappear" is chained, and there are now fewer LIGHT monsters in your Graveyard than cards in your hand, "Beckoning Light" resolves without effect (you don't discard your hand or add cards to your hand).
