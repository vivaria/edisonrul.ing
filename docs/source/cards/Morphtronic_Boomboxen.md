# MORPHTRONIC BOOMBOXEN

*   If "Morphtronic Boomboxen" activates its Attack Position effect, and an effect is chained that changes it to Defense Position, its effect still resolves.
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, the Attack Position and Defense Position effects of "Morphtronic Boomboxen" cannot be activated, because the "While in Attack Position" and "While in Defense Position" effects are negated.
