# Lumina, Lightsworn Summoner

> ① Once per turn, you can discard 1 card to Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower "Lightsworn" monster from your Graveyard. ② During each of your End Phases, send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Discarding 1 card is a cost to activate this effect.
    *   This effect targets a "Lightsworn" monster in your Graveyard. It will be negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   If you can also target a Level 4 or lower "Lightsworn" discarded for the cost.
    *   The target is Special Summoned even if Lumina is flipped face-down / leaves the field.
    *   You can't activate this effect without a valid target in the Graveyard, even if you would one as cost.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect must resolve (even if the effect is negated) before the turn can end.
    *   If you do not have enough cards to send to the Graveyard remaining in your Deck when resolving this effect, all cards remaining in your Deck are sent to the Graveyard.
    *   If the activation of this effect is negated by "Light and Darkness Dragon", it will activate again in the same End Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
    *   If this effect resolves negated by "Skill Drain", it will not activate again in the same End Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
    *   The "Lightsworn" monster (or "Judgment Dragon") must remain face-up on the field in order to activate and resolve this effect.
    *   If your opponent activates "Book of Eclipse" after you resolve this effect, when "Book of Eclipse" resolves and your affected monsters are flipped face-up (and you draw 1 card for each) then each "Lightsworn" monster (or "Judgment Dragon") will once again activate this effect \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=678963)\]
*   ② VS. "Brain Control": Player A gains control of Player B's "Lightsworn" monster until the End Phase. During the End Phase, Player A may decide in which order to activate/resolve effects:
    1.  Player A resolves "Brain Control" first, restoring control of the "Lightsworn" monster to Player B. That "Lightsworn" monster is no longer controlled by the turn player, thus its effect will not activate.
    2.  Player A activates and resolves the "Lightsworn" monster's effect to send cards from the top of their Deck to the Graveyard. Then that "Lightsworn" monster is returned to Player B's control \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=653322)\].
*   ② VS. "Enemy Controller":
    *   During Player A's turn, Player B gains control of Player A's "Lightsworn" monster. During the End Phase, when control of the "Lightsworn" monster is restored to Player A, its mandatory Trigger Effect will activate \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/85182-judgment-dragon-and-enemy-controller/)\].
