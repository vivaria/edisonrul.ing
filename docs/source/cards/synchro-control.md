# SYNCHRO CONTROL

*   Paying 1000 Life Points is a cost.
*   This targets your opponent’s Synchro Monster.
*   If you take control of a Synchro Monster and then flip it face-down, you will keep it until your End Phase and then return control of it as normal.
*   If the monster targeted by “Synchro Control” is flipped face-down before the effect resolves you do not gain control of it.
