# Shiny Black C

> ① When 1 Synchro Monster is Special Summoned to your opponent's side of the field, you can remove from play this card in the Graveyard to destroy that monster.

*   The ① Quick Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   Removing “Shiny Black C” from play is a cost.
    *   This effect targets the Synchro Monster.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down before this effect resolves, it is not destroyed.
    *   This effect can activate when exactly 1 Synchro Monster is Synchro Summoned or when it is Special Summoned by an effect (by "Call of the Haunted" or "Blackwing - Vayu the Emblem of Honor").
*   You cannot activate this effect during the Damage Step.
*   VS. “Remove Brainwashing”: If you Special Summon your opponent’s Synchro Monster with “Monster Reborn,” control of the monster is immediately shifted to your opponent. The monster is treated as being Special Summoned on your opponent’s side of the field, so you can activate the effect of “Shiny Black C.”
