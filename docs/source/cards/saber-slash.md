# SABER SLASH  
> Destroy a number of face-up cards on the field equal to the number of face-up Attack Position "X-Saber" monsters you control.

*   This effect does not target.
*   Count your face-up Attack Position XX-Saber & X-Saber monsters when “Saber Slash” resolves.
*   If the only face-up cards on the field when “Saber Slash” resolves are your own face-up Attack Position “X-Saber” monsters, you must destroy them. “Saber Slash” cannot destroy itself.
*   VS. "My Body as a Shield": "My Body as a Shield" can only be activated if it is certain that "Sabre Slash" will destroy at least 1 monster on the field \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=814158)\].
    *   Example A: Your opponent has 2 "X-Sabre" monsters, no face-up Spell / Trap Cards, and activates "Saber Slash". You you have one face-up monster, a Set "My Body as a Shield", and a face-up "Skill Drain". "Sabre Slash" is guaranteed to destroy two cards, and there's at most one non-monster that it can destroy. Therefore, you can activate "My Body as a Shield" in response.
    *   Example B: Your opponent activates "Saber Slash" while controlling 1 "X-Sabre" monster and 5 face-up Spell Cards. You control one face-up monster and a Set "My Body as a Shield". Because your opponent can choose to destroy any of their face-up cards with "Sabre Slash", you cannot activate "My Body as a Shield" in response.
*   VS. "Starlight Road": "Starlight Road" can only be activated if it is certain that a card/effect would destroy two+ cards you control. However, your opponent always has the option of destroying the face-up "X-Sabre" monster(s) that they control, so "Starlight Road" can NEVER be used \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=814158)\].
    *   VS. Your own "Starlight Road": If you control 3 "X-Saber" monsters and your opponent controls 1 face-up card, when you play "Saber Slash" it is certain that at least 2 of your "X-Saber" monsters will be destroyed, so you can activate "Starlight Road" in response to your own "Saber Slash" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=814158)\].
*   VS. "Stardust Dragon": "Sabre Slash" destroys a card(s) on the field, so Stardust can activate \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=814158)\].
