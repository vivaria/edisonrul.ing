# BRANCH!

*   The effect of “Branch!” can be chained to.
*   All of the Fusion Material Monsters do not need to be in the Graveyard in order to use the effect of “Branch!”. As long as 1 of the monsters used for the Fusion Summon is in the Graveyard, it can be Special Summoned.
*   The Fusion Material Monster can still be Special Summoned with “Branch!” even if it has been Special Summoned by another effect and then sent back to the Graveyard, or even if it was removed from play and returned to the Graveyard.
*   If a fusion substitute monster, such as “King of the Swamp”, can be Special Summoned with “Branch!” if it was used in a Fusion Summon.
