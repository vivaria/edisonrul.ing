# STRONG WIND DRAGON

*   If you Tribute a face-down Dragon for “Strong Wind Dragon,” it will still get its ATK boost.
*   “Strong Wind Dragon” gains half the Tributed Dragon’s original ATK (in the Graveyard), not half of the Dragon’s ATK as it was on the field.
*   “Strong Wind Dragon” will get its ATK boost even if you Tribute a monster that was treated as Dragon-Type because of “DNA Surgery.”
