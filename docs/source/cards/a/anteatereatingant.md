### Card Rulings

*   The Ⓒ Condition is not an effect. It cannot be negated.
*   The Ⓤ Unclassified Effect applies in the hand.
    *   This Special Summon does not start a Chain.
    *   You can send a Field Spell Card to the Graveyard as part of the cost to Special Summon “Anteatereatingant”. You can also use a Monster Card treated as an Equip Card, such as a Union Monster or a monster equipped to “Relinquished.
    *   You can't Special Summon this card from the Graveyard / banished, even if properly Summoned.
*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   The effect of “Anteatereatingant” targets 1 Spell or Trap Card.
    *   You can only activate this card’s effect once per turn. Even if “Anteatereatingant” can attack multiple times because it’s equipped with “Twin Swords of Flashing Light – Tryce”, it can only give up its potential to attack once.
    *   If you attack with “Anteatereatingant” and the attack is negated with “Negate Attack”, or a replay happens and you decide not to attack again, “Anteatereatingant” is still considered to have declared an attack. So you cannot activate its effect during Main Phase 2.
    *   If you activate the effect of “Anteatereatingant”, then activate “Skill Drain”, “Anteatereatingant” still can’t attack that turn. (Even if “Skill Drain” was chained to the effect.)
    *   You CAN activate the effect of “Anteatereatingant”, flip it face-down with a card effect, then Flip Summon it, and either activate its effect again or attack. This is because flipping it face-down resets its effect. (Also, if it’s temporarily removed from play, its effect will also reset.)
    *   If the targeted Spell or Trap Card is removed from the field in a chain to this card’s effect, you still cannot use its effect again or attack that turn. If a targeted Spell Card is not destroyed because of a counter from “Magic Reflector”, you still cannot use this card’s effect again or attack that turn.
