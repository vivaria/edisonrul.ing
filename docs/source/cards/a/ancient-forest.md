# Ancient Forest

> ① When you activate this card, change any Defense Position monster(s) to face-up Attack Position. Flip Effects are not activated at this time. ② If a monster attacks, destroy it at the end of that turn's Battle Phase.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies when “Ancient Forest” resolves.
    *   If “Dust Tornado” is Chained to the activation of “Ancient Forest,” the Defense Position monsters are not changed to Attack Position because “Ancient Forest” is no longer face-up on the field.
    *   If you activate “Ancient Forest” with the effect of “Demise of the Land” it will not change Defense Position monsters to face-up Attack Position.
    *   “Ancient Forest” will not change a monster to face-up Attack Position if it was not on the field in Defense Position when “Ancient Forest” was activated.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger-like Effect activates during the End of the Battle Phase.
    *   If a player controls both “Ancient Forest” and a Gladiator Beast monster that has attacked, at the end of the Battle Phase he can choose which effect to activate and resolve first.
    *   If “Sasuke Samurai” attacks a face-down monster and destroys it with its effect, it will still be destroyed at the end of the Battle Phase.
    *   If a monster’s attack is negated by “Magic Cylinder” it will not be destroyed by this effect.
    *   If a monster attacks and is flipped face-down by “Book of Moon” it will still be destroyed. The effect of “Ancient Forest” will only destroy a monster during the turn it attacked.
    *   If a monster attacks and is removed from the field or ceases to be a monster before the end of the Battle Phase, it will not be destroyed.
    *   If a monster attacks while “Ancient Forest” is being negated, but before the end of the Battle Phase the effect negating “Ancient Forest” disappears, the monster that attacked will be destroyed.

### Card Rulings

About the ① effect:
● It only applies once, when this card resolves. It will not affect monsters summoned afterward.
● Flip effects will not activate.
Effects that trigger upon the card being flipped face-up will activate (e.g. "Snowman Eater" / "Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo").

About the ② effect:
● It does not target.
● It activates in the End Step of the battle phase, the same timing as the tag out effect of "Gladiator Beast" monsters. The controller of multiple phase-dependent trigger effects can decide the order they want to activate them.
● "My Body as a Shield" and the effect of "Stardust Dragon" can be chained to this effect.
"Starlight Road" can be chained to this effect if 2 or more monsters you control would be destroyed.
● If a monster's attack was negated (e.g. by "XX-Saber Fulhelmknight", "Magic Cylinder" or "Scrap-Iron Scarecrow"), it will not be destroyed by this effect.
● If a monster's attack is stopped (e.g. by "Book of Moon", "Enemy Controller", "Battle Fader" or "Cyber Valley"), it will be destroyed by this effect (even if it is face-down).
