# Alien Hunter

> ① If this card destroys a monster with an A-Counter by battle, it can attack once again in a row.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   You can also end the Battle Phase without attacking again by this effect.
*   "Alien Hunter" does not have the A-Counter ATK reduction effect. So if it is the only "Alien" you control, and it battles a monster with an A-Counter, that opposing monster will NOT lose 300 ATK.
