### Edison-Accurate PSCT

### Card Rulings

About the ① effect:
*   It is a Continuous Effect, it applies from attack declaration until the Damage Step ends.
*   Spell/Trap effects may still be activated (e.g. the effect of an already activated "Ultimate Offerring"/"Royal Oppression" or the GY effect of "Skill Successor"), the Continuous Effect of Traps will also continue to apply.
*   After the Damage Step ends, it returns to the Battle Step. Then, the turn player retains priority to declare an attack, there is not a window for the opponent to activate a Spell/Trap inbetween two consecutive "Ancient Gear" attacks.
*   If this card is destroyed by battle, this effect stops applying at the start of substep 6 of the Damage Step.

About the ② effect:
*   This continuous effect effect applies from the moment the opponent's monster is destroyed by battle during Damage Calculation until it leaves the GY.
*   The destroyed monster's effects that activate after Damage Calculation has been performed will be negated.
e.g.:
"Gemini Soldier", "D.D. Warrior Lady", "Mystic Tomato", Flip and pseudo-Flip effects like "Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter", "Snowman Eater" and GY effects like "Treeborn Frog", "Plaguespreader Zombie".
*   The monster's effects are only negated while on the field/in the GY. If the destroyed monster is banished instead (e.g. due to "Macro Cosmos"/"Dimensional Fissure"), its effects are not negated once it leaves the field.
- A "D.D. Survivor" that was banished after being destroyed by this card can successfully resolve it's effect.
