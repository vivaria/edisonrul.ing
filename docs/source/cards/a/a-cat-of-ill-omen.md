*   If Imperial Order & Necrovalley are both active, and A Cat of Ill Omen is flipped, you add the card to your hand because Necrovalley is face-up on the field, even though its effect is negated.
*   If Mystical Space Typhoon is chained to the effect to destroy Necrovalley, so that Necrovalley is not on the field when this effect resolves, you can't place the card in your hand.
