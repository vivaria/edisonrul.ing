### Card Text

> ① If your opponent's monster attacks a monster on your side of the field, you can make the attack a direct attack.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Trigger-like Effect is optional, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in Start of the Battle Step - Attack Declaration (like "Mirror Force").
*   If a Fusion Monster is Special Summoned with "Magical Scientist", and attacks, you cannot choose to make the attack a direct attack on your Life Points, because the effect of "Magical Scientist" prohibiting this is mandatory, but the effect of "Astral Barrier" is optional.
*   The effect of "Astral Barrier" does not target the attacking monster.
*   If "Earthbound Spirit's Invitation" is chained to "Astral Barrier", "Astral Barrier" is applied. If "Astral Barrier" is chained to "Earthbound Spirit's Invitation", "Earthbound Spirit's Invitation" is applied.
