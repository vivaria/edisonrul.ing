### Card Text

> ① All monsters that are Special Summoned are changed to face-up Attack Position and must attack, if able, during the turn they are Special Summoned.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① mandatory Trigger-like Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect starts a Chain even if a monster(s) is Special Summoned in Attack Position.
    *   Monsters that are Special Summoned face-down are also changed to face-up Attack Position.
    *   If "All-Out Attacks" is activated when a monster is Special Summoned, its effect is not applied because it must already be face-up on the field at the time the monster is Special Summoned.
