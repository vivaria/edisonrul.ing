    *   Inflict Damage equal to the destroyed monster's ATK while face-up on the field (at the end of Substep 4 - Damage Calculation), even if it leaves the Graveyard before this effect resolves \[[REF](https://yugiohblog.konami.com/2010/05/top-4-feature-match-andrew-fredella-vs-steven-harris/)\].
        *   This ruling changed in January 2011, inflicing damage equal to the original ATK \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=20342358&postcount=3)\].
*   VS. "Colossal Fighter": Player A equips "Armory Arm" to Player B's "Archfiend Soldier", bringing its ATK to 2900. Player A"'sColossal Fighter" (ATK/2800) attacks "Archfiend Soldier" (ATK/2900), and Player A takes 100 Points of damage in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation. In Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step, Player A activates the mandatory Trigger-like Effect of "Armory Arm" (as Chain Link 1) and the optional Trigger Effect of "Colossal Fighter" (as Chain Link 2, targeting itself). When the Chain resolves, "Colossal Fighter" Special Summons itself, then "Armory Arm" deals 2800 Points of Effect Damage to Player B.
