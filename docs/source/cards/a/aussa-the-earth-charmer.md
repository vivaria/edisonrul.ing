### Card Rulings

*   The FLIP Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates (starting a Chain) even if there isn't a legal target on the field.
    *   This effect targets 1 EARTH monster your opponent controls.
    *   If “Enemy Controller” is chained to this effect and your opponent takes control of the “Charmer”, the Flip Effect disappears.
    *   If your opponent takes control of the target with “Mind Control”, control still reverts to you after the effect of “Mind Control” expires (even though it wasn’t your monster originally).
    *   If your opponent takes control of your monster with “Brain Control”, and you activate the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to take it back, you keep control while the “Charmer” is face-up on the field.
    *   If “Book of Moon” is chained to the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to flip the target monster face-down, the effect of the “Charmer” disappears.
    *   If a “Charmer” is removed from play with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, its effect is not re-applied when it’s back on the field.
    *   If “DNA Transplant” changes a monster’s Attribute so that it can be taken by a “Charmer”, and then “DNA Transplant” is destroyed so that the monster’s Attribute no longer corresponds to the effect of the “Charmer”, the controller of the “Charmer” loses control of the monster.
    *   If the turn player controls a “Charmer” and a monster controlled by its effect, and activates “Assault on GHQ” and targets the controlled monster, and the opponent chains an effect to destroy the “Charmer”, the controlled monster returns to the opponent’s control, but is still destroyed by the effect of “Assault on GHQ”.
