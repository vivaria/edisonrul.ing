### Card Text

> A player cannot attack face-down monsters during this turn.

### Card Rulings

*   If "A Feint Plan" is activated and you control only face-down monsters, your opponent cannot attack any of your monsters and they cannot attack your Life Points directly either.
*   If you activate "A Feint Plan" after your opponent declares an attack against one of your face-down monsters, that attack resolves as normal, but they cannot attack other face-down monsters for the remainder of the turn. (This is because "A Feint Plan" prevents declaring an attack against a face-down monster, and the attack has already been declared by the time "A Feint Plan" resolves during the Battle Step.)
