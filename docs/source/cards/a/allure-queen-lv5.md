### Card Rulings

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect targets a face-up monster on your opponent's field.
    *   If "Book of Moon" is chained to the activation of "Allure Queen LV5"'s effect to turn the "Allure Queen" face-down,the target is destroyed. It cannot be equipped to a face-down monster.
    *   You can equip a monster to “Allure Queen LV5” that is having its Level reduced to 5 or lower by an effect, like “Demotion”.
    *   If “Allure Queen LV5” is flipped face-down after being Special Summoned by the effect of “Allure Queen LV3”, it is no longer treated as having been Special Summoned by “Allure Queen LV3”. So you can no longer use its first effect to equip it with a monster. (However, it is still considered to have been Special Summoned for effects like “Special Hurricane”.)
    *   If “Allure Queen LV5” is Special Summoned by the effect of “Allure Queen LV3”, and is then temporarily removed from play with “Dimensionhole” or “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, after it returns to the field it can still use its first effect. The fact that it was Special Summoned by “Allure Queen LV3” is not reset.
    *   If “Allure Queen LV5” is Special Summoned by the effect of “Allure Queen LV3”, and is then permanently removed from play with “D.D. Warrior”, if it is later Special Summoned by an effect like “Return from the Different Dimension”, it is no longer treated as being Special Summoned by “Allure Queen LV3”. So it cannot use its first effect anymore.
*   The ② Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   Applying this effect does not start a Chain.
    *   The destroyed monster (that was equipped) is not considered to be destroyed by battle.
*   The ③ mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Sending this card to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   This effect cannot be activate while "Macro Cosmos" is in play.
