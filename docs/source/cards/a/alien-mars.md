# Alien Mars

> ① The effects of Effect Monsters with A-Counters are negated, except for "Alien Mars".

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   This effect can only negate the effects of face-up monsters on the field, as face-down monsters (and monsters that are not on the field) cannot hold A-Counters.
    *   “Alien Mars” will not negate the effect of “Mystic Tomato” that was destroyed by battle but had an A-Counter, since “Mystic Tomato” does not have an A-Counter in the Graveyard, where its effect activates.
