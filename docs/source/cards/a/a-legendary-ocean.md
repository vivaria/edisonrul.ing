### Card Rulings

*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated, it applies in the Deck:
*   You can have 3 cards total in your Deck between "A Legendary Ocean" and "Umi", because this card’s name is treated as "Umi". So you cannot have 3 copies of "Umi" and 3 copies of "A Legendary Ocean" in your Deck.
*   The name of "A Legendary Ocean" is treated as "Umi" always and for all purposes. If "Imperial Order" is active, the card name is still treated as "Umi". If the opponent activates "Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell" targeting "Umi", you cannot activate "Umi" or "A Legendary Ocean" for the rest of the Duel.
*   When "A Legendary Ocean" is active, you may activate "Tornado Wall".
*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
*   When "A Legendary Ocean" is active, you may Summon or Set Level 5 WATER Monsters from your hand, since they are treated as being Level 4 monsters. If you Set a Level 5 WATER monster you do not have to show your opponent.
*   When the effect of "Cyber Jar" is activated and "A Legendary Ocean" is on the field, you cannot Special Summon Level 5 WATER monsters picked-up by the effect of "Cyber Jar". This is because the effect of "A Legendary Ocean" does not include Monster Cards in the Deck.
*   If "A Legendary Ocean" and "Gravity Bind" are active, you may attack with Level 4 WATER monsters (being treated as Level 3). If "A Legendary Ocean" is destroyed after an attack is declared, a replay occurs because the Level 4 WATER monster can no longer attack.
*   If "A Legendary Ocean" and "Infinite Dismissal" are active, and you Summon a Level 4 WATER monster (being treated as Level 3), it will be destroyed during the End Phase.
*   The ② Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
*   When "A Legendary Ocean" is active, "The Legendary Fisherman" on the field is unaffected by Spell Cards, so it does not receive the ATK/DEF bonus or have its Level reduced by 1. It still is treated as Level 4 in your hand, so you may Summon it without Tribute.
*   "A Legendary Ocean" does not have the effect of "Umi" that increases/decreases the ATK and DEF of specific monster Types.
