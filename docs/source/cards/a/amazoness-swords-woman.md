### Card Text

> ① The opponent takes all Battle Damage to this card's controller that he/she would have taken from a battle involving this card.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
*   "Amazoness Swordswoman" only applies her effect to Battle Damage to her controller, so if attacked by a stronger monster, the "Amazoness Swordswoman" herself is still destroyed as normal.
*   Damage inflicted to the opponent when "Amazoness Swordswoman"'s effect is activated is Battle Damage, so the opponent cannot use "Barrel Behind the Door".
*   When "Dark Ruler Ha Des" attacks "Amazoness Swordswoman", the effect of "Amazoness Swordswoman" is still resolved.
*   When a monster affected by "Diffusion Wave-Motion" attacks "Amazoness Swordswoman", the "Amazoness Swordswoman"'s effect is applied and the opponent (who used "Diffusion Wave-Motion") takes the damage dealt to Life Points. Likewise, the controller of "Spear Dragon" takes damages when "Spear Dragon" battles "Amazoness Swordswoman" (or the controller of a monster equipped with "Fairy Meteor Crush", or who used "Meteorain").
*   When the controller of "Amazoness Swordswoman" uses "Kuriboh", the controller takes zero Battle Damage so no damage is dealt to the opponent.
*   When "Susa Soldier" battles "Amazoness Swordswoman", the controller of "Susa Soldier" takes full damage; the damage is NOT halved.
