# Archfiend Zombie Skull

> ① Face-up Zombie-Type monsters you control cannot be destroyed by card effects.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   If you control “Archfiend Zombie-Skull” and “Il Blud” and “Il Blud” is removed from the field, any monsters Summoned by the effect of “Il Blud” will not be destroyed.
    *   If monsters are being treated as Zombies by “DNA Surgery” and you attempt to Summon a 2nd copy of “Gravekeeper’s Chief” (whose Condition states "_You can only control 1 face-up "Gravekeeper's Chief"_") while you already control one, it will be destroyed because this is not considered to be a card effect.
