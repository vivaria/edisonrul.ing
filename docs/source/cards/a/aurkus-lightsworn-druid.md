*   This effect prevents monsters "everywhere" from being targeted, including monsters in the GY.
*   If you control multiple “Lightsworn” monsters, their End Phase effects don’t chain to each other (they each activate, one after another).

### Card Text

> ① "Lightsworn" monsters cannot be targeted by effects. ② During each of your End Phases, send the top 2 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies so long as this card is face-up on the field.
*   Card Effects can't target "Lightsworn" monsters on either field / Graveyard / banished.
*   "Lightsworn" monsters can't become equipped with Equip Spells. If they were already Equipped before Aurkus' effect applied, those Equip Cards remain on the field and are unaffected.
*   This does NOT negate effects; it only prevents "Lightsworn" monsters from being targeted.
*   Ex: If "Raigeki Break" targets a your "Lightsworn" monster and you chain "Glorious Illusion" to Special Summon "Aurkus, Lightsworn Druid", your "Lightsworn" monster is still destroyed.
*   VS. "Kycoo, the Ghost Destroyer": If Kycoo destroys Aurkus by battle and inflicts Battle Damage, Kycoo's Trigger Effect can activate in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation, but it can't target "Lightsworn" monsters. This is because monsters with Continuous Effects that are destroyed by battle only cease to apply those Continuous Effects in Substep 6 - Resolve Effects..
*   If you Special Summon a "Lightsworn" monster with "Glorious Illusion", and afterwards you Summon "Aurkus, Lightsworn Druid", if your opponent later destroys "Glorious Illusion" your "Lightsworn" monster is also destroyed because "Glorious Illusion" is NOT targeting your "Lightsworn" monster.
*   The ② Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
*   If the activation of this effect is negated (by "Light and Darkness Dragon"), this effect will activate again until it resolves (even if it resolves without effect due to "Skill Drain") \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
*   If you only have 1 card in your Deck when resolving this effect, it is sent to the Graveyard.
*   This card MUST be face-up on the field to activate AND resolve this effect.
*   If you resolve this effect and your opponent activates "Book of Eclipse", after "Book of Eclipse" flips this affected monster face-up (and you draw 1 card), this effect must activate again \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=678963)\].
*   VS. "Brain Control": Player A gains control of Player B's "Lightsworn" monster until the End Phase. During the End Phase, Player A decides when to activate / resolve each effect:
1.  Player A can resolve "Brain Control" first, returning the "Lightsworn" monster to Player B. That "Lightsworn" monster is no longer controlled by the turn player, its effect won't activate.
2.  Player A can activate the "Lightsworn"'s Trigger Effect to mill cards from their Deck. Then, Player A resolves "Brain Control" and returns the "Lightsworn" monster to Player B \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=653322)\].
*   VS. "Enemy Controller":
*   On Player A's turn, Player B takes control of Player A's "Lightsworn" monster. During the End Phase, "Enemy Controller"'s effect wears off and control of the "Lightsworn" monster returns to Player A, then that Lightsworns's mandatory Trigger Effect activates \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/85182-judgment-dragon-and-enemy-controller/)\].
