### Card Rulings

Each Player selects 1 card from his/her hand, then looks at the Level of the selected cards. The card with more Levels returns to the hand of the player who selected it. The player who selected the card with fewer Levels takes 1000 Life Points damage and sends the card to the GY. If a non-Monster Card is selected, it is treated as Level 0. If they are the same Level, each player returns his/her card to his/her hand.
*   If Ante is the only card in your hand, you can't activate it.
*   If your opponent has no cards in his hand, you can't activate Ante.
*   You select cards at the resolution of Ante's effect, not at Ante's activation.
*   You can't chain Barrel Behind the Door to Ante because you don't know for certain whether you will take damage.
*   If either player chains Raigeki Break or Last Turn to Ante and then has no cards at resolution of Ante's effect, Ante's effect disappears.
*   When A Legendary Ocean is active and you activate Ante, when you check the Level, treat the Levels of WATER monsters in the hand as 1 lower for purposes of Ante.
