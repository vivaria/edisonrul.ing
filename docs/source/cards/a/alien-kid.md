### Card Text

> ① Place 1 A-Counter on all monsters Special Summoned to your opponent's side of the field. ② (If a monster with an A-Counter battles an "Alien" monster, it loses 300 ATK and DEF for each A-Counter during damage calculation only.)

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   This effect does not retroactively place A-Counters on Special Summoned monsters.
    *   This effect places an A-Counter on a monster when it is Special Summoned. This happens in the Summon response timing (like "Trap Hole") before building a Chain, or before proceeding to the next Chain Link if a monster was Special Summoned while resolving a chain.
    *   If "Alien Kid" is face-up on the field when multiple monsters are Special Summoned simultaneously, then each Special Summoned monster gains one A-Counter.
*   The ② Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   If this card is not on the field, a monster with an A-Counter won't lose ATK when battling an "Alien".
