### Card Text

> Declare 1 Type of monster. ① Any monster of the declared Type cannot declare an attack during the turn it is Normal Summoned, Flip Summoned or Special Summoned.

### Card Rulings

*   You declare the Type of monster when you activate this card, not when it resolves. This means you pick the Type before the opponent decides whether to chain or not.
*   You cannot change your mind about the Type after you activate this card. The declared Type remains the same as long as this card is on the field.
*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   This effect does not target, so the effects of "Lord of D." or "Frontier Wiseman" will not protect monsters from this card’s effect.
    *   If the Type of a monster is changed (by the effect of "DNA Surgery" for example) during the turn which it was Summoned, it may attack that turn.
    *   If a monster of the declared Type is Summoned, then flipped face-down (by "Book of Moon") and face-up again (by "Book of Taiyou"), it CAN attack because the non-attack effect was reset AND because flipping it face-up with "Book of Taiyou" was NOT a Flip Summon.
