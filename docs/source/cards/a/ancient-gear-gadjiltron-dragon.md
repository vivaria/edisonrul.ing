### Card Rulings

About the ① effect:

*   It is a Continuous Effect, it applies from attack declaration until the Damage Step ends.

*   Spell/Trap effects may still be activated (e.g. the effect of an already activated "Ultimate Offerring"/"Royal Oppression" or the GY effect of "Skill Successor"), the Continuous Effect of Traps will also continue to apply.

*   After the Damage Step ends, it returns to the Battle Step. Then, the turn player retains priority to declare an attack, there is not a window for the opponent to activate a Spell/Trap inbetween two consecutive "Ancient Gear" attacks.

*   If this card is destroyed by battle, this effect stops applying at the start of substep 6 of the Damage Step.
