# CLOUDIAN - GHOST FOG

*   This effect does not target. You determine how many Fog Counters to place (based on the Level of the monster that destroyed “Cloudian – Ghost Fog” in battle) and you choose which monsters to place the Fog Counters onto when the effect is resolved.
*   If “Skill Drain” is activated while a monster has Fog Counter(s), the Fog Counter(s) remain on the monster.
