# BATTLE MANIA

*   You cannot activate this card if your opponent controls no monsters.
*   If your opponent controls a face-up Attack Position monster at the end of their Main Phase 1, they must conduct their Battle Phase during the turn “Battle Mania” is activated.
*   Monsters unaffected by Trap Cards, like “Elemental Hero Wildheart”, do not have to attack during the turn “Battle Mania” is activated.
*   During the Battle Phase of a turn in which “Battle Mania” was activated, if your “Ultimate Tyranno” attacks, but the attack is negated, it must still attack again if there is another monster in play. (It cannot attack the same target twice.)
