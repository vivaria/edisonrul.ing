# IMPERIAL ORDER

*   When "Imperial Order" is activated, "Mystical Space Typhoon" can be chained to destroy it.
*   If you chain "Imperial Order" when a Spell Card is activated, "Imperial Order" will resolve first and negate the Spell Card.
*   If you activate "Imperial Order" while Equip Spell Cards are equipped to monsters, the Equip Spell Cards remain equipped to the monsters but their effects are negated.
*   "Imperial Order" cannot be activated in the Damage Step, so you cannot activate it to negate "Rush Recklessly", etc. in the Damage Step.
*   Spell Cards can still be activated while "Imperial Order" is active, but their effects are negated.
