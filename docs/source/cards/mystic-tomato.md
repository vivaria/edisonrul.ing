# Mystic Tomato

*   If you attack with your "Mystic Tomato" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you may attack with the monster Special Summoned by "Mystic Tomato" before entering Main Phase 2.
*   If your opponent controls your "Mystic Tomato" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you get the effect of "Mystic Tomato" NOT your opponent.
*   Since the Special Summoning occurs during the Damage Step, "Torrential Tribute", etc. cannot be used.
