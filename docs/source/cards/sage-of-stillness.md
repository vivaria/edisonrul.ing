# SAGE OF STILLNESS

*   This effect activates at the same time that the monster destroyed by battle is sent to the Graveyard.
*   This effect will activate even if this card destroys a Monster Token, because the text does not require the destroyed monster to be sent to the Graveyard.
*   If this card destroys “Embodiment of Apophis”, this effect will activate.
*   This effect will activate if you destroy your monster controlled by your opponent.
*   The effects of face-up Continuous Cards can be activated even while the effect of this card is being applied.
