# REPTILIANNE NAGA

*   This effect activates even if “Reptilianne Naga” is destroyed during the Damage Step. If “Reptilianne Naga” is in face-up Attack Position, the effect to change it to Attack Position does not activate. The effect to change a monster’s ATK to 0 applies as long as that monster is face-up on the field.
