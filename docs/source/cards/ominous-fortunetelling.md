# OMINOUS FORTUNETELLING

*   The opponent must reveal the randomly selected card to you after you call a type to confirm if you were right or wrong.
*   If the opponentâ€™s hand is revealed by the effect of "Mind on Air", etc., turn his/her hand face-down and then randomly select a card.
*   If you have two copies of "Ominous Fortunetelling" on the field, you select a card and call a type for the first copy, and then select a new card and call a type again for the second copy.
