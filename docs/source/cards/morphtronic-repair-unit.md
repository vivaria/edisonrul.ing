# MORPHTRONIC REPAIR UNIT

*   Sending a “Morphtronic” monster to the Graveyard is a cost to activate “Morphtronic Repair Unit.” The effect targets 1 “Morphtronic” monster in your Graveyard.
*   There must be a “Morphtronic” monster in your Graveyard in order to activate “Morphtronic Repair Unit.” However, as long as there is an eligible target in your Graveyard, you can send a “Morphtronic” monster from your hand to the Graveyard,and then target the monster you just sent. If there are no “Morphtronic” monsters in your Graveyard, you cannot do this.
