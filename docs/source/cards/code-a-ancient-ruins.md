# CODE "A" ANCIENT RUINS

> ① Each time a face-up "Alien" monster(s) is destroyed, place 1 A-Counter on this card. ② Once per turn, you can remove 2 A-Counters from anywhere on the field to Special Summon 1 "Alien" monster from your Graveyard.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect does not start a chain.
    *   No A-Counter is placed on this card if an "Alien" monster face-down when an attack is declared.
*   The ② Ignition-llike Effect targets an "Alien" monster in your Graveyard.
    *   Removing 2 A-Counters from this card is a cost.
    *   This card must remain face-up on the field in order to resolve this effect.
