# SAND MOTH

*   If a face-down “Sand Moth” is attacked by “Mystic Swordsman LV2” or “Sasuke Samurai” its effect will activate. But if it is attacked by “Drillroid” it will not activate since it will be face-up when it is destroyed by the effect of “Drillroid”.
*   If the opponent controls your face-down “Sand Moth” and it is destroyed by a card effect, it will be Special Summoned to the owner’s side of the field.
*   If “Sand Moth” is Special Summoned by its own effect, and then flipped face-down or removed from the field, its original ATK and DEF return to 1000 / 2000.
*   If a face-down “Sand Moth” is targeted by “Acid Trap Hole” its effect will not activate since it will be face-up when it is destroyed.
*   After “Sand Moth” is Special Summoned by its own effect, if you equip it with “Megamorph” you will either halve or double its new (2000) original ATK.
*   After “Sand Moth” is Special Summoned by its own effect, if you activate “Shield & Sword” it will have 1000 ATK / 2000 DEF for that turn.
*   Even if “Skill Drain” is active when “Sand Moth” is Special Summoned by its own effect, its ATK and DEF will remained switched. (2000 ATK / 1000 DEF).
