# POWER FILTER

*   Even if a monster's ATK would become more than 1000 after it is Special Summoned, you cannot Special Summon it while "Power Filter" is active.
*   Monsters with 1000 or less ATK cannot be Special Summoned face-down with "The Shallow Grave", etc.
*   Monsters with "?" ATK can be Special Summoned.
