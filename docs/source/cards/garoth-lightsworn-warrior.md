# Garoth, Lightsworn Warrior

> ① Each time a card(s) is sent from your Deck to the Graveyard by the effect of a "Lightsworn" monster you control, except "Garoth, Lightsworn Warrior", send the top 2 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard. Then, draw 1 card for each "Lightsworn" monster sent to the Graveyard by this effect.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect will activate every time its trigger is met.
    *   When this effect resolves: drawing 1 card for each "Lightsworn" monster does not start a Chain.
    *   If this effect sends "Peten the Dark Clown" to the Graveyard, its effect can activate, even if you would draw a card(s) by this effect.
    *   All cards remaining in your Deck are sent to the Graveyard if there aren't enough remaining.
*   If an effect chained to a “Lightsworn” monster’s (or “Judgment Dragon’s”) effect to send cards from your Deck to the Graveyard during the End Phase that removes that “Lightsworn” monster from the field, the “Lightsworn” monster’s effect does not resolve.
