# REVOKE FUSION

*   Fusion Monsters that are not Fusion Summoned with "Polymerization" ("XYZ-Dragon Cannon", etc.) can be selected with "Revoke Fusion" and you can Special Summon 1 of the Fusion Material Monsters listed on the Fusion Monster.
*   You cannot Special Summon a Fusion Material Monster that is not specified by name. Example: You cannot select "Chimeratech Overdragon" with "Revoke Fusion" and Special Summon a "Blowback Dragon", but you can Special Summon a "Cyber Dragon".
*   Fusion Monsters that do not specify any Fusion Material Monsters by name ("Five-Headed Dragon", etc.) cannot be selected with "Revoke Fusion".
*   You cannot select a Fusion Monster that does not list any Fusion Material Monsters you can Special Summon. Example: You cannot select "Dragon Master Knight" because you cannot Special Summon "Black Luster Soldier" or "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" from your hand.
*   You cannot activate "Revoke Fusion" if there are no monsters in your hand that you can Special Summon
