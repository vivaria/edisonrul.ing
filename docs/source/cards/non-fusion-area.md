# NON-FUSION AREA

*   You cannot activate “Power Bond”, “Miracle Fusion”, or “Dragon’s Mirror” when this card is active because they are treated as Fusion Summons. You can activate “Fusion Gate”, but you cannot activate its effect.
*   You can still Special Summon a Fusion Monster with a card effect like “Metamorphosis” or “Cyber-Stein”.
