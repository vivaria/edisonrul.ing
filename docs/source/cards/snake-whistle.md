# SNAKE WHISTLE

*   This card can be activated when a Reptile-Type monster you control is destroyed by a Spell, Trap, or Monster effect. "Snake Whistle" cannot be activated in the Damage Step.
*   You can only activate this card if the Reptile-Type monster’s destruction is the last thing to occur in a chain. This is similar to the activation timing for both “Dark Magician of Chaos” and “Peten the Dark Clown.”
*   You cannot activate this card when a Reptile-Type monster that is being treated as a Spell Card (by "Relinquished", etc.) is destroyed.
*   You can activate this card when your opponent's Reptile-Type monster you control (with "Brain Control", etc.) is destroyed and sent to their Graveyard.
*   You can activate this card when a Reptile-Type monster you control is destroyed and removed from by (by "Bottomless Trap Hole", etc.)
*   You cannot activate this card if you have no Level 4 or lower Reptile-Type monsters in your Deck.
