# LUCKY CHANCE

*   "Lucky Chance"'s Trigger Effect is chained to the effect of the Effect Monster. You choose what you think the coin flip will be when you resolve "Lucky Chance"'s effect.
*   If you control 2 or more face-up "Lucky Chance", you will only call the coin toss once and you will draw 1 card if you call it right.
*   If you use the effect of "Second Coin Toss" to re-flip the coin, you do not reselect for "Lucky Chance".
