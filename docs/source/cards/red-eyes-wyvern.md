# Red-Eyes Wyvern

> ① During your End Phase, if you did not Normal Summon or Set a monster that turn, you can remove from play this card from your Graveyard to Special Summon 1 "Red-Eyes" monster from your Graveyard, except "Red-Eyes B. Chick".

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates in the Graveyard
    *   Removing this card from play is a cost.
    *   This effect targets 1 "Red-Eyes" monster in your Graveyard \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=848277)\].
*   You CAN activate this effect if you did not Normal Summon or Set during this turn.
    *   Even if this was because you could not (by "[Lava Golem](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Lava_Golem)" / "[Hidden Armory](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Hidden_Armory)").
*   You CANNOT activate this effect if:
    *   "[Red-Eyes Wyvern](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Red-Eyes_Wyvern)" was only discarded to the Graveyard during the End-of-Turn Discard because you had more cards than your hand size limit (see Edison Format Rule #10 [HERE](https://www.edisonformat.com/format-rules.html)).
    *   You Set / Normal Summoned (even if it was negated by "[Solemn Judgment](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Solemn_Judgment)") a monster this turn.
