# Yubel - Terror Incarnate

*   Destroying all other monsters during the End Phase is a Trigger Effect.
*   When a face-up "Yubel - Terror Incarnate" is sent to Graveyard, removed from play, or returned to its owner's hand, its effect to Special Summon "Yubel - The Ultimate Nightmare" activates. This effect cannot be activated when it is returned to its owner's Deck.
*   When "Yubel - Terror Incarnate" is removed from the field, its owner activates its effect. (If your opponent controls your "Yubel - Terror Incarnate" when it is removed from the field, you get the effect, not your opponent.)
