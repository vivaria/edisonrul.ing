# POWER PICKAXE

*   This effect targets the monster in your opponent’s Graveyard.
*   Removing the monster is an effect, not a cost.
*   If the target monster is not removed from play by this effect, the equipped monster does not gain ATK.
*   If the Level of the equipped monster is lower than the targeted monster when this effect resolves, the targeted monster is not removed from play.
*   Removing the target monster from play and gaining 500 ATK happen at the same time.
*   If “Power Pickaxe” is negated, the equipped monster loses the 500 ATK.
    *   It will not regain it even if “Power Pickaxe” stops being negated.
*   If “Power Pickaxe” is destroyed, the previously equipped monster loses the 500 ATK.
*   Monsters removed by this effect remain removed from play even after the End Phase.
