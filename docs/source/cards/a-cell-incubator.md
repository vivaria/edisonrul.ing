# 'A' CELL INCUBATOR  
> ① Each time an A-Counter(s) is removed from play by a card effect, place 1 A-Counter on this card. ② When this card is destroyed, distribute the A-Counters on this card among face-up monsters.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies on the field.
    *   This effect does not use the Chain.
    *   If an A-Counter is removed to pay a cost, an A-Counter is placed upon “’A’ Cell Incubator”.
    *   If an A-Counter on this card is removed by an effect, place an A-Counter upon “’A’ Cell Incubator”.
    *   The effect of “’A’ Cell Incubator” is not applied when A-Counters are removed because the card with the A-Counters was removed from the field or flipped face-down, because these A-Counters are not removed by an effect.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger-like Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard (or banished).
    *   You may place A-Counters on face-up monsters on either field.
