# MORPHTRONIC ACCELERATOR

*   Returning 1 "Morphtronic" monster from your hand to the Deck is not a cost.
*   "Morphtronic Accelerator" targets 1 card on the field.
*   When the "Morphtronic" monster is returned from your hand to the Deck, the Deck is shuffled before the targeted card is destroyed and before you draw 1 card.
*   Destroying the target and drawing 1 card are considered to happen at the same time.
*   If you do not have any cards remaining in your Deck, you cannot activate "Morphtronic Accelerator".
*   If you cannot destroy the targeted card, you must still return 1 "Morphtronic" card from your hand to the Deck, but you do not draw 1 card.
*   If you do not have a “Morphtronic” monster in your hand when "Morphtronic Accelerator" resolves, "Morphtronic Accelerator"'s effect disappears.
