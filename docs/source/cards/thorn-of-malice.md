# THORN OF MALICE

*   “Thorn of Malice’s” effect that reduces a monster’s ATK & DEF starts a Chain. The ATK & DEF reduction from “Thorn of Malice” lasts as long as the reduced monster is face-up on the field.
*   Effects like “Imperial Order” or “Spell Canceller” will not remove the ATK & DEF reduction.
*   If your monster equipped with “Thorn of Malice” battles a monster with equal ATK while both monsters are in Attack Position, your monster is destroyed but the opponent’s is not, because the effect of “Thorn of Malice” prevents it from being destroyed.
*   If your “Thorn of Malice” is equipped to your opponent’s monster, it will not prevent your monsters from being destroyed in battle with the equipped monster.
*   Your “Thorn of Malice” only prevents the opponent’s monsters from being destroyed by your equipped monster.
