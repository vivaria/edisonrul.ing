# GADGET HAULER

*   Sending any number of "Morphtronic" monsters from your hand to the Graveyard is not a cost.
*   The ATK increase from "Gadget Hauler"'s effect lasts until it is removed from the field or flipped face-down.
*   If "Gadget Hauler"'s effect is activated while "Banisher of the Radiance" is face-up on the field, the "Morphtronic" monsters are removed from play instead of being sent to the Graveyard, and “Gadget Hauler’s” ATK does not increase.
