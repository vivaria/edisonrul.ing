# Morphtronic Remoten

*   Removing a card for the Attack Position effect of “Morphtronic Remoten” is not a cost, it’s part of the effect. The effect targets the “Morphtronic” monster in your Graveyard. So if you activate the effect and “D.D. Crow” is chained to remove the targeted card from play, the effect does not resolve.
*   Sending a card to the Graveyard for the Defense Position effect of “Morphtronic Remoten” is not a cost, either. It is part of the effect. The Defense Position effect of “Morphtronic Remoten” does not target.
*   If “Macro Cosmos” is active, you can send a card to the Graveyard for the Defense Position effect of “Morphtronic Remoten,” but the effect to add a monster to your hand will not resolve.
*   If you have no “Morphtronic” monsters in your Graveyard, you cannot activate the Defense Position effect of “Morphtronic Remoten.”
