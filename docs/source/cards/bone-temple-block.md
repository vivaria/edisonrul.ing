# Bone Temple Block

*   Discarding a card is part of the resolution of “Bone Temple Block.”
*   The effects of “Bone Temple Block” happen in sequence, so if you discard “Archfiend of Gilfer,” it will miss the timing on and not activate its effect.
*   "Born Temple Block" targets the Monster Cards selected by each player.
*   The turn player selects a monster first. If you activate “Bone Temple Block” during your opponent’s turn, your opponent selects first.
*   If your opponent is under the effects of “Scapegoat” and cannot Special Summon, you can still activate “Bone Temple Block.” In this case, only you would Special Summon a monster.
*   You cannot activate “Bone Temple Block” if there are no monsters in either Graveyard to Special Summon.
