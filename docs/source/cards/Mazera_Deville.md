# MAZERA DEVILLE

*   You cannot use "Monster Reborn", etc. on "Mazera DeVille" even if he is Special Summoned properly, because he "cannot be Special Summoned, EXCEPT by...".
*   If you Special Summon "Mazera DeVille", his effect activates, and your opponent chains "Mystical Space Typhoon" to destroy "Pandemonium" in a chain, "Mazera Deville"'s effect disappears because his effect needs "Pandemonium" on the field when the effect resolves, not just when it activates (just like "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn").
*   If your opponent has less than 3 cards in his hand, he must discard his entire hand.
