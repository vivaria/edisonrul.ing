> ① When this card you control is sent to the Graveyard, look at the top card of your Deck. Return that card to either the top or the bottom of the Deck.

*   The ① Trigger Effect is mandatory.
    *   This effect only activates when it is sent from your side of the field to your Graveyard.
    *   This effect does not activate if “Dark Tinker” is sent to your Graveyard under your opponent's control.
