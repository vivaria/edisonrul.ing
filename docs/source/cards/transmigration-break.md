# TRANSMIGRATION BREAK

*   You cannot activate "Pot of Avarice" while "Transmigration Break" is active.
*   You can activate "Cyberdark Impact!" while "Transmigration Break" is active, but the "Cyberdark" Monsters are removed from play instead of being returned to the Deck.
*   If an effect would return a Fusion Monster in the Graveyard to its owner's hand or Extra Deck, the Fusion Monster is removed from play instead.
