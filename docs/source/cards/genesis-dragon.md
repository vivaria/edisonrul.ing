# GENESIS DRAGON

> ① Once per turn, you can send 1 Dragon-Type monster from your hand to the Graveyard to add 1 Dragon-Type monster from your Graveyard to your hand. ② When this card is sent from the field to the Graveyard, you can return all Dragon-Type monsters from your Graveyard to your Deck.

*   The ① Ignition Effect targets a Dragon-Type monster in the Graveyard.
    *   Discarding 1 Dragon-Type monster is a cost. You can target the discarded Dragon.
    *   You CANNOT activate this effect if you have no Dragon-Type monsters in your Graveyard.
    *   This effect will be negated by "Necrovalley".
*   The ② optional "_When... you can..._" Trigger Effect can miss the timing.
    *   This effect does not target any cards in the Graveyard. It is not negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   If activated, return all available Dragon-Type monsters (including "Genesis Dragon") to the Deck.
    *   This effect can activate even if "Genesis Dragon" is sent to the Graveyard from the hand / Deck, or while treated as an Equip Spell by "Relinquished".
