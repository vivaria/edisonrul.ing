# GALLIS THE STAR BEAST

> ① You can reveal this card in your hand to send the top card of your Deck to the Graveyard. If that card is a monster, inflict damage to your opponent equal to its Level x 200, and Special Summon this card from your hand. If it is not a monster, destroy this card.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates and resolves in the hand.
    *   If you cannot Special Summon monsters when this effect resolves, you still send the top card of your Deck to the Graveyard (and inflict damage if it was a monster). "Gallis the Star Beast" is not Special Summoned, and (if a non-monster card was sent) is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.
    *   This effect CAN activate and resolve normally even while "Macro Cosmos" is active.
    *   This effect CAN be activated even while "Des Wombat" prevents effect damage from being dealt. If a Monster Card is sent: no damage is dealt, but Gallis is Special Summoned.
    *   This effect CANNOT activate while you are prevented from Special Summoning by "Vanity's Fiend".
    *   Revealing this card to your opponent is a cost to activate its effect.
*   This effect resolves sequentially:
    *   "_send the top card of your Deck to the Graveyard_" occurs before "_If that card is a monster, inflict damage to your opponent equal to its Level x 200, and Special Summon this card from your hand. If it is not a monster, destroy this card_".
    *   If a Monster Card is sent: damage is inflicted AND Gallis is Special Summoned simultaneously
*   This effect is not guaranteed to inflict effect damage, thus "[Barrel Behind the Door](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Barrel_Behind_the_Door)" cannot be activated.
*   CARD LEGALITY: In Edison Format, promotional cards from video games and other media were legal for play in North American events so long as an English translation / copy of the card was used. Konami would not reverse this policy until late 2010 \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?s=25207dc48f1f8866472fb43a67e259f3&p=20134042&postcount=10)\].
