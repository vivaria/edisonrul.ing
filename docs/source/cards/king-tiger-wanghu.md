# KING TIGER WANGHU  
> ① Destroy all monsters with an ATK of 1400 or less that are Normal Summoned or Special Summoned.

*   This ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Trap Hole").
    *   This effect verifies ATK at resolution, and includes all ATK modifiers.
    *   This effect activates if a monster(s) is Summoned face-down (by "Super Nimble-Mega Hamster"), it does not destroy the Special Summoned monster because its ATK cannot be verified.
    *   If this effect activated in response to a Normal Summon, it can be negated by "Pulling the Rug".
    *   If this effect activated in response to a Special Summon, it can be negated by "Swallow Flip".
    *   If multiple monsters are Normal / Special Summoned in a Chain, Wanghu triggers once and destroys all monsters with 1400 or less ATK that were Normal / Special Summoned in that Chain \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=28892642&postcount=5)\].
*   VS. Ignition Effect Priotity: Player A Normal Summons "Exiled Force". Whangu's Trigger Effect starts a chain immediately, "Exiled Force" is destroyed (it's effect can't activate as a Chain Link of 2+).
*   VS. "Return from the Different Dimension": If a monster(s) with ATK 1400 or less is Special Summoned simultaneously with Wanghu, Wanghu's effect will trigger and start another Chain. If Wanghu itself has 1400 or less ATK when resolving its effect, it is also destroyed.
*   VS. "Treeborn Frog": "Treeborn Frog" will be destroyed, but can Special Summon itself again. Doing so without purpose is considered stalling, a violation of Tournament Policy.
