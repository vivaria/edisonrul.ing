# SPIRITUALISM

> Return 1 Spell or Trap Card on your opponent's side of the field to the owner's hand. This card's activation and effect cannot be negated by any other card.

*   The Spell / Trap Card goes to its ownerâ€™s hand.
*   This targets 1 Spell / Trap Card your opponent controls, even monsters treated as Equip Spell Cards.
*   If you cannot activate (play face-up) Spell Cards, you cannot activate this card.
    *   This may be due to an effect like "Spell Canceller", "Sonic Jammer", or "Cold Wave".
