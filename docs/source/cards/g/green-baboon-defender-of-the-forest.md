> You can pay 1000 LP; Special Summon this card.

### Card Rulings

*   You can only activate 1 Trigger Effect in your hand per chain.
(You can't activate the ① effect of this card more that once per chain, even if you have multiple copies in your hand/GY).
*   This card's effect can't be activated in the Damage Step, so it can't be activated when a Beast is destroyed by battle.
