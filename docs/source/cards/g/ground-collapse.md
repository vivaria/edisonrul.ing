### Card Rulings

*   When resolving the effect of Cyber Jar or Morphing Jar #2, if you pick up more monsters than you can Special Summon, due to Ground Collapse, the monsters you can't Special Summon are destroyed. If a Sangan or Witch of the Black Forest is destroyed this way, its effect does not activate.
*   While Ground Collapse's effect is negated, monsters can be Summoned or Set into the selected Monster Card Zones. When Ground Collapse becomes active again, the selected Monster Card Zones can't be used, but any monster in the selected Monster Card Zones remains there.
*   You can't select a Monster Card Zone that is already selected by another Ground Collapse.
*   If your opponent takes control of your monster with Brain Control and then activates Ground Collapse, if there are no open Monster Card Zones for the monster to return to in the End Phase, it is destroyed.
