    *   This Special Summon is not a Fusion Summon, it can be performed under "Non-Fusion Area".

        *   They are not combined onto the same Chain.
        *   The turn player may resolve ALL their "Gladiator Beast" monsters' tag-out effects before their opponent is allowed to activate any of their own "Gladiator Beast" tag-out effects.

*   “Battling” requires this card to be involved in Damage Calculation
(If this card's attack is negated, the ② effect can't activate).
*   If multiple “Gladiator Beast” effects are activated at the end of the Battle Phase,
they don’t go on the same Chain (they each activate, one after another, each on their own Chain).
*   If this card was originally Special Summoned by its own procedure, it can still later be Summoned by card effects.
