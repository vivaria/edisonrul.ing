# Gravekeeper's Assailant

> ① If "Necrovalley" is on the field when this card declares an attack, you can change the battle position of 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates in Start of the Battle Phase - Attack Declaration.
    *   This effect targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.
    *   If the target is no longer face-up, its battle position is not changed.
    *   The target can only be changed to face-up Defense Position. This effect does not Set the target.
    *   This effect can be activated even if "Necrovalley"'s effects are negated by "Magic Deflector".
    *   "Necrovalley" only needs to be face-up when this effect activates, not when it resolves.
*   VS. "Spirit Reaper": When targeted by Assailant, "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed by its own effect. Then a replay occurs, as the number of attack targets changed before entering the Damage Step. In this case, "Gravekeeper’s Assailant" can attack again, and can activate its effect again.
