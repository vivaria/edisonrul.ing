# Gladiator Beast Laquari

> ① If this card is Special Summoned by the effect of a "Gladiator Beast" monster, its original ATK is 2100. ② At the end of the Battle Phase, if this card attacked or was attacked, you can return it to the Deck to Special Summon 1 "Gladiator Beast" monster from your Deck, except "Gladiator Beast Laquari".

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   This effect no longer applies if Laquari is flipped face-down, leaves the field, or has its effects negated by “Skill Drain” (even if “Skill Drain” is later negated / destroyed).
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect may be activated if this card was engaged in Damage Calculation.
    *   Returning the “Gladiator Beast” monster to the Deck is a cost.
    *   You can shuffle your opponent's "Gladiator Beast" (that you obtained by "Brain Control") into their deck and Special Summon a different named "Gladiator Beast" from yours.
    *   You cannot activate this effect unless there is a valid “Gladiator Beast” in Deck to Special Summon.
    *   You cannot activate this effect if your “Gladiator Beast” monster that battled was flipped face-down during the Battle Phase (even if it is flipped face-up before the end of the Battle Phase).
    *   "Royal Oppression" and “Divine Wrath” can be chained to this effect. The effect will be negated, but the “Gladiator Beast” monster will not be destroyed because it is in the Deck.
    *   If 2 or more “Gladiator Beast” battled this turn, their effects will activate and resolve separately.
        *   They are not combined onto the same Chain.
        *   The turn player may resolve ALL their "Gladiator Beast" monsters' tag-out effects before their opponent is allowed to activate any of their own "Gladiator Beast" tag-out effects.
    *   If a "Gladiator Beast" monster's attack is stopped (by "Gravity Bind") or is negated (by "Negate Attack"), that "Gladiator Beast" cannot activate its effect at the end of the Battle Phase.
