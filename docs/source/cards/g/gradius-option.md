# Gradius' Option

*   The ATK/DEF of "Gradius’ Option" is the same as the current ATK/DEF of the selected "Gradius", not the original ATK/DEF. So if you equip "Axe of Despair" to "Gradius", the ATK of "Gradius’ Option" will also increase by 1000 points.
*   Equipping "Axe of Despair" to "Gradius’ Option" has no purpose. Activating "Reinforcements" targeting "Gradius’ Option" serves no purpose. "Luminous Spark" on the field will not change the ATK/DEF of "Gradius’ Option". It always has the same ATK/DEF of the selected "Gradius".
*   If the selected "Gradius" is flipped face-down, "Gradius’ Option" is destroyed.
*   If the selected "Gradius" is temporarily removed from play by the effect of "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" or "Dimensionhole", "Gradius’ Option" is destroyed.
*   If "Gradius’ Option" is temporarily removed from play by the effect of "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" or "Dimensionhole", when it returns to the field you must select a new "Gradius". If there is no "Gradius" on the field, it is destroyed.
*   If you pick up "Gradius’ Option" by the effect of "Cyber Jar" you cannot Special Summon it, even if "Gradius" is also in the 5 cards you picked up. It is placed in your hand instead.
*   If you pick up "Gradius’ Option" by the effect of "Morphing Jar #2" you cannot Special Summon it, and it is sent to the Graveyard.
*   ”Shrink” has no effect on “Gradius’ Option”.
