# Goyo Guardian

> 1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters._
_① When this card destroys an opponent’s monster by battle and sends it to the Graveyard, you can Special Summon that monster to your side of the field in face-up Defense Position.

*   The Synchro Material Monsters do not need to be EARTH monsters, contrary to recent Errata.
*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates at the start of Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step (when monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the Graveyard) of the Damage Step.
    *   This effect only activates if Goyo is face-up on the field (ex: "Flamvell Firedog" and [MANY MORE](https://www.duelingbook.com/deck?id=7967783)).
    *   This effect forms a Chain with and other cards/effect that activate in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step (ex: "Michizure", "Legendary Jujitsu Master", "Mystic Tomato").
    *   VS. "Creature Swap": If Goyo destroys your monster that your opponent controlled, this effect can still Special Summon it from your Graveyard.
*   This ① optional Trigger Effect will NOT activate if:
    *   Goyo battled a monster with equal ATK and both were destroyed.
    *   Goyo is removed from the field by the effect of "D.D. Warrior Lady".
    *   Goyo is removed from the field by a Flip Effect (ex: "Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter" or "Penguin Soldier").

### Card Rulings

● This card does not require an EARTH Tuner. You can use any Tuner (This is an Erratum).
● This card’s effect specifies “and sends it to the GY”. It triggers at the end of the Damage Step, but not if the destroyed monster wasn’t sent to the GY, or if this card is no longer face-up on the field.
