### Card Text

> ① If this card was Special Summoned by the effect of a "Gladiator Beast" monster, at the end of any Battle Phase, if this card attacks or was attacked, Special Summon 2 "Gladiator Beast" monsters from your Deck, except "Gladiator Beast Secutor".

### Card Rulings

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates if this card has engaged in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.
*   If you have only 1 available Monster Zone Space, you will still choose 2 “Gladiator Beast” monsters. You will Special Summon one, and the other will be destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.
*   If you only have 1 “Gladiator Beast” monster in Deck when resolving this effect, then no monster is Summoned when this effect resolves. Your opponent may verify by briefly revealing your Deck.
    *   You cannot activate this effect if your “Gladiator Beast” monster that battled was flipped face-down during the Battle Phase (even if it is flipped face-up before the end of the Battle Phase).
*   Returning the “Gladiator Beast” monster to the Deck is a cost.
*   You can shuffle your opponent's "Gladiator Beast" (that you obtained by "Brain Control") into their deck and Special Summon a different named "Gladiator Beast" from yours.
*   You cannot activate this effect unless there is a valid “Gladiator Beast” in Deck to Special Summon.
*   "Royal Oppression" and “Divine Wrath” can be chained to this effect. The effect will be negated, but the “Gladiator Beast” monster will not be destroyed because it is in the Deck.
*   If 2 or more “Gladiator Beast” battled this turn, their effects will activate and resolve separately.
    *   The turn player may resolve ALL their "Gladiator Beast" monsters' tag-out effects before their opponent is allowed to activate any of their own "Gladiator Beast" tag-out effects.
    *   They are not combined onto the same Chain.
*   If a "Gladiator Beast" monster's attack is stopped (by "Gravity Bind") or is negated (by "Negate Attack"), that "Gladiator Beast" cannot activate its effect at the end of the Battle Phase.

### Card Rulings

● "Battling" requires this card to be involved in Damage Calculation
(If this card's attack is negated, the ② effect can't activate).
● If multiple "Gladiator Beast" effects are activated at the end of the Battle Phase,
they don’t go on the same Chain (they each activate, one after another, each on their own Chain).
● If the activation of this effect is negated (e.g. by "Light and Darkness Dragon"), the activation condition "if the card battled" is reset, so it will not activate again.
● This effect will activate and resolve even if you do not have two free monster zones. If you have one free monster zone you can choose one "Gladiator Beast" monster to summon and the other will be destroyed by game mechanics. If you have no free monster zones they are both destroyed.
● If this card has it’s effects negated, it is still considered to be summoned by the effect of a "Gladiator Beast" monster.
● If this card is flipped face-down, it is no longer considered to be summoned by the effect of a "Gladiator Beast" monster.
