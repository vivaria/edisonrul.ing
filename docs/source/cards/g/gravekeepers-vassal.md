# Gravekeeper's Vassal

*   The damage that is inflicted to your opponent’s Life Points as a result of battle with "Gravekeeper’s Vassal" attack is treated as effect damage instead, not Battle Damage. So your opponent cannot use "Kuriboh" or "Waboku" to prevent the damage, for example.
*   A monster destroyed by "Gravekeeper’s Vassal" in battle is still treated as "destroyed as a result of battle" (for "Mystic Tomato", "Nimble Momonga", etc.).
*   If you equip "Fairy Meteor Crush" to "Gravekeeper’s Vassal", and attack a Defense Position monster and inflict Battle Damage to the opponent’s Life Points, the damage is treated as effect damage due to "Gravekeeper’s Vassal"’s effect.
*   You cannot activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against damage inflicted by "Gravekeeper’s Vassal" because its effect is a Continuous Effect and you cannot activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against Continuous Effects.
