# Guardian Grarl

*   If you wish to use "Guardian Grarl"'s effect to Special Summon him from your hand, you still must have "Gravity Axe - Grarl" on your side of the field.
*   You cannot Tribute Summon "Guardian Grarl" by Tributing a monster equipped with your only "Gravity Axe - Grarl" on your side of the field, because the "Gravity Axe - Grarl" will no longer be on the field when the Summon occurs.
