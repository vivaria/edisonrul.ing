### Card Rulings

*   Goblin of Greed prevents discarding as a cost, but not as part of an effect. So Goblin of Greed will stop Kuriboh, but not Mirage of Nightmare or Graceful Charity.
*   If your opponent activates an effect and discards as a cost, and you chain Call of the Haunted to Special Summon Goblin of Greed, he doesn't stop the effect because the cost was already paid.
