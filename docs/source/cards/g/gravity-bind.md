### Card Text

> ① Level 4 and higher monsters cannot attack.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect does not activate.
*   If you activate "Gravity Bind" when a Level 4+ monster attacks, the attack stops but is not negated.
*   If your opponent activates "Mirror Force" when your Level 4+ monster attacks, chaining "Gravity Bind" does not stop "Mirror Force" from destroying your Attack Position monsters.
