### Card Rulings

*   The effect of Greed only applies to cards drawn while Greed was active. If Jar of Greed is chained to Greed's activation, Jar of Greed (Step 2) resolves and you draw 1 card for Jar of Greed before Greed’s effect (Step 1) was active, so no damage is inflicted during the End Phase. But if you chain Greed (Step 2) to Pot of Greed (Step 1), then Greed is active before Pot of Greed resolves, so the activator of Pot of Greed takes 1000 damage from Greed.
*   You can chain to the effect of Greed that inflicts damage.
