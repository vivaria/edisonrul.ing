### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① Each player can only control 1 Attribute of monster.
> Send all other face-up monsters they control to the GY.

### Card Rulings

*   As soon as this starts applying (when it initially starts resolving, or applies again after being negated), players send monsters to the gy.
*   After that, if you have monsters with the wrong Attribute, they are destroyed by game mechanics.

While you control a face-up monster, you can:
*   Tribute Summon a monster using your only face-up monster, even if it has the wrong Attribute.
(EG: Your only face-up monster is "Treeborn Frog". You can Tribute it for "Caius the Shadow Monarch").
*   Take control of an opponent's monster with EG "Brain Control", even if it has the wrong Attribute.
(If it has the wrong Attribute, it's immediately sent to the GY).
*   Summon/Set monsters face-down, even if they have the wrong original Attribute.
*   If you control no monsters, you can Summon multiple monsters with different Attributes at the same time.
(After they're summoned, send monsters you control to the GY so that you only control 1 Attribute).

While you control a face-up monster, you can't:
*   Ritual/Fusion/Synchro Summon a monster with the wrong Attribute, even if you would use the monsters you control as tribute/material.
(EG, you can't use 2 Sea-Serpents to Synchro Summon a Psychic).
*   Flip/Normal/Special Summon a monster with the wrong Attribute.

If a Set Monster is attacked:
*   It's not sent to the GY until After Damage Calculation.
*   Its Flip Effect will activate, but it is not "destroyed by battle"
(EG, Shura and Mystic Tomato won't trigger, since nothing was destroyed by battle).

### Card Text

> ① Each player sends monsters they control to the Graveyard until they each control monsters of only 1 Attribute. Each player cannot control monsters with different Attributes.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies immediately after this Trap Card’s activation resolves: both players look at the face-up monsters they control and each choose 1 Attribute to keep and send their face-up monsters that aren’t that Attribute to the Graveyard.
*   Monsters like "Dark Simorgh" can still be Summoned, they only have one Attribute while in hand.
*   Monsters like "Dark Simorgh" whose Continuous Effects treats them as having an extra Attribute are sent to the Graveyard unless their effects are negated by "Skill Drain". This does not start a Chain.
*   If a face-down with a different Attribute is attacked, it is flipped face-up in Substep 2 - Flip Face-Down, and is sent to the Graveyard at the start of Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation. Flip Effects will still activate, but effects that trigger when the monster is destroyed by battle will not.
*   While this effect applies, and you control a face-up monster, YOU CANNOT:
*   Flip / Normal / Special Summoning a monster of a different Attribute.
*   Ritual Summon a monster of a different Attribute by Tributing the face-up monster(s).
*   Fusion/Synchro Summon a monster of a different Attribute using the face-up monster(s) as Material.
*   Tribute your opponent's monsters to Summon "Lava Golem", unless they are all FIRE Attribute
*   While this effect applies:
*   You can Tribute Summon a monster of any Attribute by Tributing your only face-up monster(s). Konami's reversal of this ruling was delivered months after SJC Edison \[[REF](https://web.archive.org/web/20120427230353/http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/gameplay/card_faq1.html)\].
*   You can Set/Tribute Set/Special Summon monsters face-down of any Attribute.
*   You can activate and resolve "Creature Swap" & "Brain Control". If an exchanged monster's Attribute differs from those already face-up on that field, it is immediately sent to the Graveyard.
*   You can activate cards that Summon multiple monsters (if you have no face-up monsters). All of them are Summoned, then you pick one Attribute and send all others to the Graveyard.
*   VS. "Gladiator Beasts": Your Glad Beasts can tag out (return to your Deck) as long as there is another Gladiator Beast in your Deck of the correct Attribute that you COULD Summon. However, if you have no face-up monsters when the effect resolves, you can Summon a Glad Beast of any Attribute.
*   VS. "Lonefire Blossom": you cannot activate "Lonefire Blossom"'s effect unless you have a FIRE Plant-Type monster in your Deck. If you Tribute your only face-up monster (Lonefire) for this effect, you can Special Summon a non-FIRE Plant-Type monster (ex: "Dandylion", "Tytannial, Princess of Camellias").
*   VS. Uria, Lord of Searing Flames: You cannot Special Summon Uria by sending Gozen + 2 face-up Continuous Traps to the Graveyard unless you control no face-up monsters non-FIRE monsters.
