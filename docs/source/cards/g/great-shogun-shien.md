# Great Shogun Shien

> Ⓤ If you control 2 or more "Six Samurai" monsters, you can Special Summon this card from your hand. ① Your opponent can activate only 1 Spell/Trap Card each turn. ② If this card would be destroyed, you can destroy a "Six Samurai" monster you control instead.

*   The Ⓤ Unclassified Effect works like a built-in Special Summon. This Summon does not start a chain.
*   The ① Continuous Effect applies so long as "Great Shogun Shien" is face-up on the field.
    *   Your opponent can activate either 1 Spell Card or 1 Trap Card each turn; not one of each.
    *   If the activation of your opponent’s Spell/Trap Card is negated (by “Dark Bribe"), they can still activate 1 more Spell/Trap Card after that.
    *   This effect applies during both players’ turns.
    *   The effects of face-up Spell / Trap Cards can be activated without restriction.
    *   The effects of Spell / Trap Cards in the Graveyards can be activated without restriction.
    *   If your opponent activates a Spell / Trap Card, and later you Special Summon “Great Shogun Shien” (or flip him face-up), your opponent can activate 1 more Spell / Trap Card this turn.
*   The ② Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   This effect does not target. You cannot destroy a face-down “Six Samurai” monster instead.
    *   This effect applies while resolving the effect (ex: "Call of the Haunted", "Raigeki Break").
    *   Your other “Six Samurai” monster is considered to be destroyed by this (your) effect.
        *   Example: If “Ring of Destruction” targets a “Six Samurai” monster, and you destroy a different “Six Samurai” monster instead, zero damage will be inflicted by “Ring of Destruction”.
    *   This effect can apply in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation. The substitute “Six Samurai” is sent to the Graveyard in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step, it is not treated as '_destroyed by battle_'.
    *   You cannot destroy 1 “Six Samurai” to save multiple other “Six Samurai” monsters at the same time.
        *   Example: If "Mirror Force" would destroy 2 of your "Six Samurai" monsters, you must destroy 2 Defense Position "Six Samurai" monsters to save those two.
    *   This effect cannot apply if the substitute “Six Samurai” is also being destroyed by the effect.
        *   Example: If "Mirror Force" would destroy all your "Six Samurai", you cannot substitute any.
*   If you control 2 “Six Samurai” monsters, and 1 of them equipped with “Legendary Ebon Steed” would be destroyed, the effect of “Legendary Ebon Steed” must be used. You cannot choose to destroy another “Six Samurai” monster instead.
