# Greenkappa

*   If there is only 1 face-down Spell or Trap Card on the field when the effect of “Greenkappa” is activated, the effect disappears.
*   You can chain to the effect of “Greenkappa”, even with the targeted Spell or Trap Cards. If only 1 of the 2 cards is chained, “Greenkappa” will still resolve and destroy the other. If “Greenkappa” is destroyed in a chain to its effect (such as with “Torrential Tribute”) its effect still resolves.
*   Since “Greenkappa” targets, you can use “Fake Trap” to save your Trap Card(s) that were targeted by “Greenkappa”.
