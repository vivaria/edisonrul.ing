### Card Rulings

*   If Getsu Fuhma is destroyed by damage calculation, its effect still activates as long as it battled a monster and damage calculation was performed.
*   If an attack is negated by Magic Cylinder, etc., then Getsu Fuhma's effect does not activate.
*   If Getsu Fuhma's ATK is large enough to destroy Vampire Lord by damage calculation, then Getsu Fuhma's effect doesn't activate and Vampire Lord won't be Special Summoned, because it was destroyed by damage calculation and not by a card effect.
*   If Getsu Fuhma is destroyed by Dark Ruler Ha Des, Getsu Fuhma's effect is not activated.
