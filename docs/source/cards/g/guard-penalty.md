### Card Rulings

*   You can only draw 1 card from “Guard Penalty’s” effect. You draw 1 card the first time the selected monster is changed to Defense Position. Drawing the 1 card can't be chained to.
*   “Guard Penalty’s” effect must resolve before the selected monster is changed to Defense Position. If the opponent chains “Enemy Controller” to change the selected monster’s position, you won't draw a card.
*   You draw 1 card even if the selected monster is changed from Attack Position to face-down Defense Position. If you select “Guardian Sphinx” you could use its effect to flip itself face-down and draw 1 card.
*   If an effect changes the selected monster to Defense Position in the middle of a chain, you draw 1 card immediately after that effect resolves. You don't wait for the entire chain to resolve.
