*   While “G.B. Hunter” is in play, you can't activate effects that would return monsters to the Extra Deck, such as “De-Fusion,” “De-Synchro,” or “Compulsory Evacuation Device” targeting a Fusion or Synchro Monster.
*   If “G.B. Hunter” and “Grave Protector” are both active, monsters destroyed by battle can't return to the Deck, so they go to the GY instead.
*   If “G.B. Hunter” is active, you can't activate “Chain Healing” as Chain Link 2 or 3.
*   If “G.B. Hunter” is active and “Morphing Jar #2’s” Flip Effect is activated, it will activate but the effect won't be applied.
*   If “G.B. Hunter” is active, the first effect of “Storm Caller” can't be used. If “G.B. Hunter” is active, the effect of “Mystic Swordsman LV6” can be used to automatically destroy a monster that it attacks. But you can't activate the effect to return that monster to the Deck.
*   If “G.B. Hunter” is active, you can't activate “Bait Doll” or “The Mask of Remnants.”
