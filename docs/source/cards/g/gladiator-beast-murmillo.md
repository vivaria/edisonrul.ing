### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① If this card is Special Summoned by the effect of a "Gladiator Beast" monster:
> Target 1 face-up monster on the field; destroy that target.
> ② At the end of the Battle Phase, if this battled:
> You can shuffle it into the Deck; Special Summon 1 "Gladiator Beast" monster from your Deck (except “Gladiator Beast Murmillo”).

### Card Rulings

The ② effect:
*   It can't be activated unless there is a “Gladiator Beast” monster in your Deck.
*   It can activate and resolve while “Skill Drain” is applying (without being negated).
*   It can be negated by “Royal Oppression” (If it is, this card remains in the Deck (it is not destroyed)).
*   “Battling” requires this card to be involved in Damage Calculation
(If this card's attack is negated, the ② effect can't activate).
*   If multiple “Gladiator Beast” effects are activated at the end of the Battle Phase,
they don’t go on the same Chain (they each activate, one after another, each on their own Chain).

Vs "Rivalry of Warlords"/"Gozen Match":
*   If you have a Gladiator Beast of the same Type/Attribute in your Deck, you can activate the ② effect.
If you do, you can Summon any Gladiator Beast of any Attribute.

### Card Text

### Card Rulings

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect cannot miss the timing.
*   This effect targets a face-up monster (it will targets one of yours if your opponent has none).
*   If the target is flipped face-down, it is not destroyed.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect may be activated if this card was engaged in Damage Calculation.
*   Returning the “Gladiator Beast” monster to the Deck is a cost.
*   You can shuffle your opponent's "Gladiator Beast" (that you obtained by "Brain Control") into their deck and Special Summon a different named "Gladiator Beast" from yours.
*   You cannot activate this effect unless there is a valid “Gladiator Beast” in Deck to Special Summon.
*   You cannot activate this effect if your “Gladiator Beast” monster that battled was flipped face-down during the Battle Phase (even if it is flipped face-up before the end of the Battle Phase).
*   "Royal Oppression" and “Divine Wrath” can be chained to this effect. The effect will be negated, but the “Gladiator Beast” monster will not be destroyed because it is in the Deck.
*   If 2 or more “Gladiator Beast” battled this turn, their effects will activate and resolve separately.
*   They are not combined onto the same Chain.
*   The turn player may resolve ALL their "Gladiator Beast" monsters' tag-out effects before their opponent is allowed to activate any of their own "Gladiator Beast" tag-out effects.
*   If a "Gladiator Beast" monster's attack is stopped (by "Gravity Bind") or is negated (by "Negate Attack"), that "Gladiator Beast" cannot activate its effect at the end of the Battle Phase.
