# Goblin Zombie

> ① When this card inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent, send the top card of their Deck to the Graveyard. ② When this card is sent from the field to the Graveyard, add 1 Zombie-Type monster with 1200 or less DEF from your Deck to your hand.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation of the Damage Step.
    *   If "Macro Cosmos" applies, the top card of your opponent's Deck is removed from play instead.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect cannot miss the timing.
    *   This effect only activates if this card is sent to the Graveyard, not if removed from play.
    *   This effect activates even if you have no targets remaining in your Deck.
    *   This effect will activate even during the Damage Step.
    *   If used in a Synchro Summon, this effect must activate; you cannot claim Ignition Effect Priority to activate the Ignition Effect of the Synchro Monster (ex: “Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier”).
    *   If used to Synchro Summon “Mist Wurm”, both mandatory Trigger Effects activate: “Goblin Zombie” (Chain Link 1) activates first, then “Mist Wurm” (Chain Link 2) if the Synchro Summon is successful.
