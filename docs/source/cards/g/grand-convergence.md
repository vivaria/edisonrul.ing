### Card Rulings

*   Inflicting 300 damage and destroying all monsters on the field are both resolved at the same time.
*   If the 300 damage would be reduced to 0 by the effect of “Des Wombat” or “Pikeru’s Circle of Enchantment”, “Grand Convergence” can still be activated and all monsters on the field will still be destroyed.
*   If an effect that destroys “Macro Cosmos” or removes it from the field is chained to “Grand Convergence”, the effects of “Grand Convergence” will still resolve because the activation conditions were correct when it was activated.
*   “Barrel Behind the Door” can be chained to this card.
*   If there is a monster on the field, you can chain “My Body as a Shield” to this card.
