# Grave Of The Super Ancient Organism

> All face-up Level 6 or higher Special Summoned monsters on the field cannot declare an attack or activate their effects.

*   Even mandatory effects cannot activate while “Grave of the Super Ancient Organism” is active.
*   This card does not negate effects, it prevents both players from activating such effects.
*   If a monster’s Level is lowered below 6, it is no longer affected.
*   Level 6+ Monsters Special Summoned before this card resolves are affected.
*   If a monster's effect was activated, and this card was chained, that effect still resolves.
