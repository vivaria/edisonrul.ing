# Gladiator Beast Darius

> ① When this card is Special Summoned by the effect of a "Gladiator Beast" monster, you can select 1 "Gladiator Beast" monster from your Graveyard and Special Summon it. Ⓛ That monster's effect(s) is negated, and it is returned to your Deck when this card is removed from the field. ② At the end of the Battle Phase, if this card attacked or was attacked, you can return it to the Deck to Special Summon 1 "Gladiator Beast" monster from your Deck, except "Gladiator Beast Darius"._

*   The ① optional "_When... you can..." Trigger Effect can miss the timing.
    *   This effect targets 1 "Gladiator Beast" monster in the Graveyard. It is negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   The target can still activate its effect.
    *   The target is continuously targeted by Darius's effect while Darius is on the field \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=847041), [REF2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=13130602&postcount=7)\].
    *   If the target battles, it can return to the Deck for no effect while Darius is face-up.
*   The target's effects are not negated:
    *   if the target is flipped face-down / leaves the field (by "Book of Moon" or "Bottomless Trap Hole").
    *   if Darius is flipped face-down / leaves the field ("Book of Moon" / "Compulsory Evacuation Device").
    *   Darius VS. "Bottomless Trap Hole": If "Bottomless Trap Hole" chains to Darius' effect (in response to Darius' Summon) the target is Special Summoned and its effects are negated \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=847041), [REF2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=13130602&postcount=7)\].
        *   This ruling conflicts with the "Book of Moon" ruling. DO NOT APPLY this ruling to other cards!
*   VS. "Skill Drain":
    *   If Darius leaves the field while "Skill Drain" applies, the target remains on the field.
    *   If the target battles, it can return to the Deck for full effect, which is not negated by Darius. This is because "Skill Drain" is negating Darius' Ⓛ effect.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect may be activated if this card was engaged in Damage Calculation.
    *   Returning the “Gladiator Beast” monster to the Deck is a cost.
    *   You can shuffle your opponent's "Gladiator Beast" (that you obtained by "Brain Control") into their deck and Special Summon a different named "Gladiator Beast" from yours.
    *   You cannot activate this effect unless there is a valid “Gladiator Beast” in Deck to Special Summon.
    *   You cannot activate this effect if your “Gladiator Beast” monster that battled was flipped face-down during the Battle Phase (even if it is flipped face-up before the end of the Battle Phase).
    *   "Royal Oppression" and “Divine Wrath” can be chained to this effect. The effect will be negated, but the “Gladiator Beast” monster will not be destroyed because it is in the Deck.
    *   If 2 or more “Gladiator Beast” battled this turn, their effects will activate and resolve separately.
        *   They are not combined onto the same Chain.
        *   The turn player may resolve ALL their "Gladiator Beast" monsters' tag-out effects before their opponent is allowed to activate any of their own "Gladiator Beast" tag-out effects.
    *   If a "Gladiator Beast" monster's attack is stopped (by "Gravity Bind") or is negated (by "Negate Attack"), that "Gladiator Beast" cannot activate its effect at the end of the Battle Phase.

### Card Rulings

The ① and ② Effects:

● If Darius isn't face-up on the field before the ① resolves:
The Summoned monster is no longer targeted by Darius.
(its effects aren't negated, and it isn't shuffled if Darius leaves the field).
Exception: If Darius is banished by "Bottomless Trap Hole", its effects remain negated.
● If the Target, or Darius, is flipped face-down, Darius stops targeting it.
(its effects aren't negated, and it isn't shuffled if Darius leaves the field).
