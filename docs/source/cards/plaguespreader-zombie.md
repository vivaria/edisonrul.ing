# PLAGUESPREADER ZOMBIE  
> ① You can return 1 card from your hand to the top of the Deck to Special Summon this card from the Graveyard. Ⓛ If you do, remove this card from play when it is removed from the field.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   Placing a card from your hand on top of the Deck is a cost.
    *   This effect does not target a card in the Graveyard. It is not negated by "Necrovalley".
*   The Ⓛ Lingering effect banishes this card when it would leave the field.  
    *   This does not start a chain.  
    *   This works like "Battle Fader"'s Condition - meaning that "Caius the Shadow Monarch" will not inflict Effect Damage if its effect banishes "Plaguespreader Zombie" summoned by the ① effect.  
    *   This effect disappears if "Plaguespreader Zombie" is flipped face-down.
