# ELEMENTAL HERO PRISMA

> ① Once per turn, you can reveal 1 Fusion Monster from your Fusion Deck and send 1 of the Fusion Material Monsters listed on that card from your Deck to the Graveyard. Until the End Phase, this card’s name is treated as the sent monster’s name.

*   The ① Ignition Effect has no activation cost.
    *   When this effect resolves: reveal a Fusion Monster and send a named Fusion Material Monster.
    *   Prisma only gains the printed name, it will not gain categories (such as Tuner, Toon, Spirit, etc).
    *   This effect can be activated while "Dimensional Fissure" is active. The Fusion Material Monster is removed from play as it is sent to the Graveyard, and Prisma gains its printed name.
    *   If an effect is chained that removes "Elemental Hero Prisma" from the field or flips it face-down, "Elemental Hero Prisma"'s effect disappears. You do not reveal a Fusion Monster or send one of the listed Fusion Material Monsters to the Graveyard \[[REF](http://web.archive.org/web/20080703055137/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/COMMUNITY/forums/thread/1215851.aspx)\].
    *   VS. "Rainbow Neos": you may only send "Elemental Hero Neos". You cannot send "Rainbow Dragon" or "Rainbow Dark Dragon", as "Rainbow Neos" actually lists "1 'Ultimate Crystal' monster" as the other Fusion Material \[[REF](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Rainbow_Neos)\].
