# The Unhappy Girl

*   "The Unhappy Girl"'s effect only applies to "manual" changes. You can still change the monster's position with an effect.
*   If "The Unhappy Girl" is in attack position and her controller uses "Waboku" or "Kuriboh" to take no damage from the attack, the attacking monster still cannot change battle position.
*   If "Tyrant Dragon" or "Hayabusa Knight" attacks "The Unhappy Girl" in attack position, they cannot attack again that turn.
*   If "The Unhappy Girl" is flipped face-down and then flipped face-up again, then her effect is reset and any monsters that battled with her before can change their battle position and attack again.
*   If "The Unhappy Girl" applies her effect to a monster, and "Skill Drain" is then activated and resolves, and "Skill Drain" is then destroyed afterwards, then "The Unhappy Girl"'s effect is re-applied and the monster that battled with her before "Skill Drain" was activated cannot attack or change battle position once again.
*   If your opponent attacks your "The Unhappy Girl" and you use "Magic Cylinder" to negate the attack, then "The Unhappy Girl"'s effect is not applied.
*   If you take control of your opponent's "The Unhappy Girl", her effect on your monsters from previous attacks is still applied.
