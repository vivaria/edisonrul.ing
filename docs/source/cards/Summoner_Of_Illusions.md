# SUMMONER OF ILLUSIONS

*   Tributing 1 monster is a cost.
*   You must use "Summoner of Illusions"’ effect when it is flipped face-up, either by Flip Summon or by being attacked. If you have no cards in your Extra Deck, the effect cannot activate and you do not Tribute 1 monster.
*   If you use "Dimensionhole" on the Fusion Monster summoned by this card’s effect, it will return during your next Standby Phase and not be destroyed.
*   If the Fusion Monster summoned by this card’s effect is flipped face-down it will not be destroyed during your End Phase, since the condition is reset when the monster becomes face-down.
