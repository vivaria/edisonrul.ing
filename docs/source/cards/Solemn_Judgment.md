# SOLEMN JUDGMENT  
> Pay half of your Life Points. â‘  Negate an activation of a Spell / Trap Card / Normal Summon / Flip Summon / Special Summon and destroy the Spell Card, Trap Card, or Summoned monster.

*   Paying half your Life Points is a cost. If this results in a fraction, your Life Points are rounded up.

*   NEGATE the activation (playing face-up on the field) of a Spell / Trap Card.
    *   DO NOT negate activated effects of Spell / Trap Cards (ex: "Royal Oppression", "Geartown").
*   NEGATE the Normal / Flip / Tribute / Special Summon of a monster (ex: "Chaos Sorcerer, "Gladiator Beast Gyzarus", a Synchro Summon) that did not start a Chain.
    *   This occurs in the Summon negation timing (before the monster is successfully Summoned).
    *   Negate the Normal Summon from "Ultimate Offering"'s effect that resolved as Chain Link 1.
    *   DO NOT negate Monster Effects (ex: "Debris Dragon", "Dark Simorgh").
    *   DO NOT negate the Normal Summon from "Ultimate Offering" / "Mausoleum of the Emperor".
