### Card Rulings

*   This card's ① effect can only be used once per turn.
(It "remembers" if it used this effect even after being Set).
*   If this Set card is attacked, it's still on the field when its effect resolves, so it counts itself towards the number of monsters to return to the hand.
*   This effect doesn't target (PSCT from this bot will always state when an effect targets).
