### Card Rulings

●The ② is a Quick Effect.
● If monsters are Summoned and cards are Set at the same time, you can only choose to destroy monsters or Set cards with the ②.
● If a card is Set with "Book of Moon", you can destroy it with the ②.
● The ② can't be activated during the Damage Step, so you can't activate it if a monster is Summoned by the effect of "Giant Rat".
