### Card Rulings

*   The cards sent to the GY after the activation of “Full Salvo” are sent to the GY by the effect of “Full Salvo”. They are not a cost. So they are sent when “Full Salvo” resolves, not when it is activated.
*   If you send a “Dark World” monster to the GY for the effect of “Full Salvo”, its effects don't activate because it was not “discarded”.
