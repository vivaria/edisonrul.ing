# Future Fusion

> ① Send, from your Deck to the Graveyard, Fusion Material Monsters that are listed on a Fusion Monster Card, and select that 1 Fusion Monster from your Fusion Deck. Ⓛ Special Summon a Fusion Monster from your Fusion Deck with the same name as the selected Fusion Monster during your 2nd Standby Phase after this card's activation. (This Special Summon is treated as a Fusion Summon.) ② When this card is removed from the field, destroy that monster. ③ When the monster is destroyed, destroy this card.

*   You CANNOT reveal a Fusion Monster whose Fusion Material list a Fusion or Synchro Monster.
*   You CANNOT reveal a Contact Fusion Monster (ex: "Gladiator Beast Gyzarus", "Chimeratech Fortress Dragon") since they do not use "Polymerization" to Fusion Summon. Also, Evil Hero Fusions CANNOT be revealed as their Summon Condition specifies they must be Special Summoned by "Dark Fusion".
*   You CANNOT activate this card if "Dimension Fortress Weapon" is face-up on the field.
*   You CANNOT reveal "Five-Headed Dragon" with this card while "Koa'ki Meiru Drago" is face-up on the field. You CANNOT activate this card if "Vanity's Fiend" is face-up on the field.
