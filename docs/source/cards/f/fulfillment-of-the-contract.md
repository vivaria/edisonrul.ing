# Fulfillment Of The Contract

*   You cannot use “Fulfillment of the Contract” to Special Summon a Ritual Monster that was discarded from the hand, or otherwise not properly Summoned.
*   You can chain to the first part of this card’s effect. However, the last part (that destroys the monster) does not start a chain.
