### Card Rulings

*   If "Felgrand Dragon" is sent from the field to the Graveyard and afterwards it is removed from play (with "D.D. Crow", etc.), "Felgrand Dragon" cannot be Special Summoned with "Dimension Fusion" because "Felgrand Dragon" cannot be Special Summoned from the Removed Zone. If the “Felgrand Dragon” is returned to the Graveyard from the Removed Zone (with “Miracle Dig”, etc.), the “Felgrand Dragon” cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard because it was not sent from the field to the Graveyard.
*   The ATK gained by "Felgrand Dragon" when it is Special Summoned disappears when "Felgrand Dragon" is removed from the field or flipped face-down.
*   If "Skill Drain" is face-up on the field when "Felgrand Dragon" is Special Summoned, or if "Skill Drain" is activated after "Felgrand Dragon" is Special Summoned, "Skill Drain" will negate "Felgrand Dragon"'s ATK gaining effect. If "Skill Drain" is later negated or removed from the field, the ATK gain is not reapplied.
*   When "Felgrand Dragon" is Special Summoned, its controller selects 1 monster in his/her Graveyard as a target. If the selected monster is removed from play in chain to this effect, "Felgrand Dragon"'s effect will disappear and it will not gain ATK.
*   After "Felgrand Dragon"'s ATK gaining effect is resolved, the ATK gain will not disappear if the selected monster is removed from the Graveyard.
*   The text “This monster cannot be Special Summoned except from the Graveyard, and only if it was sent there from the field” is a condition and not an effect. It cannot be negated by “Dark Ruler Ha Des”, etc.
