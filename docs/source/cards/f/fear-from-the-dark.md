# Fear From The Dark

*   "Fear from the Dark" can be Normal Summoned.
*   Only the owner of "Fear from the Dark" can use its effect, because it has to be sent from your hand to your Graveyard.
*   When you discard "Fear from the Dark" with "Painful Choice", "Fear from the Dark"'s effect does not activate because it was your own card effect that caused it.
*   If "Fear from the Dark" is sent to the Graveyard during a card effect's resolution, or during a chain, activate "Fear from the Dark"'s effect after the current effect or chain has resolved.
*   If "Fear from the Dark" is sent to the Graveyard by "Last Turn"'s effect, "Fear from the Dark" is Special Summoned to the field before the attack of "Last Turn" happens.
