### Card Rulings

*   The ① mandatory Trigger-like Effect cannot miss the timing.
    *   This effect targets the Normal Summoned monster.
    *   Ignition Effect Priority does not apply when a monster is Normal Summoned, since this effect must activate in the Summon reponse timing (and Ignition Effects cannot be chained).
    *   This card must remain face-up on the field in order to activate and resolve this effect.
    *   Example 1: Player A controls Normal Summons "Necroface" while Player B's "Future Visions" is face-up. The mandatory Trigger(-like) Effects of "Future Visions" and "Necroface" activate simultaneously. Following the rules of SEGOC: Player A’s "Necroface" is Chain Link 1, and Player B’s "Future Visions" is Chain Link 2. Then, Player A activates "Book of Moon" as Chain Link 3, targeting "Necroface". When the Chain resolves, "Book of Moon" flips "Necroface" face-down, "Future Visions" banishes the Set "Necroface" (face-up), and finally "Necroface" makes both player shuffle all banished cards back into their respective Decks (including the banished "Necroface". Afterwards, a new chain is built because the other mandatory Trigger Effect of "Necroface" activates, and will cause both players to banish the top 5 cards of their Decks face-up.
    *   Example 2: Player A controls an active "Future Visions". Player A, on their turn, Normal Summons "Green Gadget" and activates its option Trigger Effect simultaneously with "Future Visions’s" mandatory Trigger-like Effect. Following the rules of SEGOC, Chain Link 1 will be "Future Visions", and Chain Link 2 will be the effect of "Green Gadget". Player B then activates "Ultimate Offering" as Chain Link 3 and declares activation of its effect by paying 500 Life Points. When resolving the chain, Player B Normal Summons "Debris Dragon" from their hand by the effect of Ultimate Offering, then "Green Gadget" adding "Red Gadget" from Player A’s Deck to their hand, and finally "Future Visions" removes "Green Gadget" from play. Since the last thing to happen was not the Normal Summon of "Debris Dragon", its optional Trigger Effect will not activate, however, "Future Visions’s" mandatory Trigger-like Effect will activate and start a new chain.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger-like Effect cannot miss the timing.
    *   This effect activates when the controller of a removed monster(s) decides to activate it.
    *   This card must remain face-up on the field in order to activate and resolve this effect.
    *   This effect does not perform a Summon. "Torrential Tribute" CANNOT be activated.
    *   The monster returns to the field. Effects that trigger when the monster is Summoned do not activate.
    *   The owner of a removed monster(s) decides which Monster Card Zone it is placed in when returned.
    *   If more than one monster is removed from play by the effect of "Future Visions", they are all returned to the field at the same time. If the player has fewer available Monster Card Zones than there are monsters that would be returned by this effect, that player chooses which monsters to return to the field and sends the remainder to the Graveyard.
