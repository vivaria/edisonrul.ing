*   In order to activate its effect, Fox Fire must be face-up when the attack that destroyed it was declared (like Atomic Firefly). If a face-down Fox Fire is attacked, its effect is not applied even though it is face-up when destroyed.
*   While Skill Drain is active, you can Tribute Fox Fire for a Tribute Summon.
*   If the opponent controls your face-up Fox Fire, and it is destroyed as a result of battle, it will be Special Summoned to your (the owner’s) side of the field during the End Phase.
