### Card Rulings

*   Sending a “Blackwing” monster to the Graveyard is a cost to activate this effect.
*   This effect targets 1 Normal Trap Card.
*   The activation timing of the selected Normal Trap Card has to be appropriate for the time "Fake Feather" was activated.
*   If the effect of the copied Normal Trap Card targets, you have to select the target for the copied effect when "Fake Feather" resolves. In this case, “Fake Feather” targets the Normal Trap Card, as well as the target for the effect.
    *   (Example: If you activate “Fake Feather” and target “Reinforcements,” then target “Spirit Reaper,” “Fake Feather” targets both cards, so “Spirit Reaper” is destroyed.)
        *   If the selected Normal Trap Card has a cost, you do NOT have to pay that cost. You cannot activate “Fake Feather” during the Damage Step.
