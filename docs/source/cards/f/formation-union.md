*   The monster you equip the Union Monster to must be "appropriate", meaning the monster name written in the text of the Union Monster.
*   The Union Monster is considered to be equipped 'by its effect' so any bonuses the Union Monster grants are granted if equipped with "Formation Union".
*   A Union Monster that is "detached" during the Battle Phase using "Formation Union" can attack during that Battle Phase.
*   If the player who would control the Union Monster already has 5 monsters on the field, you cannot activate "Formation Union" and choose the second effect.
