### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① Once per turn: You can banish 2 LIGHT monsters from your GY, then target 1 face-up monster with more ATK than this card; destroy that target.

### Card Rulings

● If Freed leaves the field before this effect resolves, the target is still destroyed (this is due to a TCG/OCG ruling difference). While Freed is not on the field, consider his ATK to be 1700.
