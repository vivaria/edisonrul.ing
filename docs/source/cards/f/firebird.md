# Firebird

*   The effect of “Firebird” is a Trigger Effect that activates when 1 or more Winged Beast-Type monster(s) on the controller’s side of the field are destroyed. If the monsters were destroyed as a result of battle, the timing of this effect is at the end of the Damage Step, when the monsters are sent to the Graveyard.
*   You can chain to the activation of “Firebird”’s effect, including with “Divine Wrath”.
*   If 2 or more Winged Beast-Type monsters on the controller’s side of the field are destroyed at the same time, the ATK of “Firebird” only increases by 500 points.
*   Winged Beast-Type tokens on the controller’s side of the field are included and will increase the ATK of “Firebird” when destroyed.
*   Monsters on the controller’s side of the field that are changed to Winged Beast-Type by “DNA Surgery” are included and will increase the ATK of “Firebird” when destroyed.
*   When face-down Winged Beast-Type monsters are destroyed (by a card effect), the ATK of “Firebird” does not increase.
*   The ATK increase from the effect of “Firebird” remains as long as “Firebird” remains face-up on the field.
