# FIREWALL

*   Removing from play 1 Pyro-Type monster in your Graveyard is a cost to activate this card’s effect.
*   Paying 500 Life Points during your Standby Phase does not start a Chain.
*   This card’s effect does not target.
*   If "Elemental Hero Wildheart", or another monster that is unaffected by the effects of Trap Cards, attacks directly, you cannot activate the effect of "Firewall".
