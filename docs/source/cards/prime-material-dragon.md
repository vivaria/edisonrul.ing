# PRIME MATERIAL DRAGON  
> ① Any effect that would inflict damage to a player instead increases their Life Points by the same amount. ② When a card's effect to destroy a monster(s) on the field is activated, you can send 1 card from your hand to the Graveyard to negate its activation and destroy the card.

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not start a chain. This effect applies to both players.
    *   If "[The Immortal of Thunder](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/The_Immortal_of_Thunder)" is sent to the Graveyard, its owner will still lose 5000 Life Points.
    *   This effect does not stack. Two copies of "Prime Material Dragon" will NOT cause "Ookazi" to incease Life Points by 1600, it only converts the damage into Life Point gain \[[REF](http://web.archive.org/web/20080131140306/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/COMMUNITY/forums/thread/1005905.aspx)\].
    *   VS. "\[Darklord\] Nurse Reficule": if both "Nurse Reficule" and "Prime Material Dragon" are on the field when Player A's "Upstart Goblin" resolves, Player B will gain 1000 Life Points (gains / damage happen normally) \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=808154)\]. These rules apply similarly to "Bad Reaction to Simochi".
*   The ② Quick Effect can be activated the Damage Step.
    *   This effect can negate the activation of a Monster Effect (ex: "Dark Armed Dragon").
    *   This effect can negate the activation of Spell / Trap Card that would destroy a monster(s) (ex: "Smashing Ground"), and "Deck Devastation Virus" if it would destroy 1(+) monster on the field.
    *   You can negate the effect of a Spell / Trap Card that destroys a monster(s) (ex: "Blaze Accelerator", "Skull Lair"), even of a "Lightning Vortex" milled by "Destiny Hero - Diamond Dude".
    *   This effect can negate a card / effect that would destroy more than just monsters so long as at least one monster would be destroyed when it was activated (ex: "Black Rose Dragon").
*   The ② Quick Effect CANNOT be activated if the effect:
    *   would not destroy a monster right away (ex: "Magical Hats", "Limiter Removal").
    *   might not destroy a monster (ex: "Barrel Dragon", "Magical Dimension", "Acid Trap Hole").
    *   is Continuous (ex: "Kotodama") and does not start a chain.
