# YUBEL

*   "Yubel"'s damage inflicting effect is a Trigger Effect that activates before damage calculation.
*   Tributing 1 monster or destroying "Yubel" is a Trigger Effect that activates during your End Phase. You make your choice when the effect resolves.
*   When "Yubel" is destroyed while in the hand or Deck, its effect activates. If it is destroyed while face-down, its effect activates.
*   The owner of "Yubel" activates the effect. (If your opponent controls your "Yubel" when it is destroyed, you get the effect, not your opponent.)
*   When "Yubel" is destroyed during the Damage Step, its effect can be activated.
