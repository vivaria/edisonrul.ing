# DISCIPLE OF THE FORBIDDEN SPELL

*   Choosing Attributes is a Trigger Effect that activates when “Disciple of the Forbidden Spell” is Summoned. Your opponent could chain “Disappear” to remove from play 1 “Disciple of the Forbidden Spell” in the Graveyard and you would choose 1 less Attribute.
*   If “Chain Destruction” is chained to the Trigger Effect when “Disciple of the Forbidden Spell” is Summoned, “Chain Destruction” will resolve first, so all your copies of “Disciple of the Forbidden Spell” will be in the Graveyard, and you choose a number of Attributes equal to the new amount.
*   If you have 2 copies of this card in the Graveyard when you Summon it, you must choose 2 different Attributes.
*   The effect of “Disciple of the Forbidden Spell” is activated at the start of the Damage Step, before the attacked monster is flipped face-up. If this card attacks a face-down monster, it will not be destroyed by this effect, even if it is revealed to have 1 of the chosen Attributes.
*   If LIGHT was a chosen Attribute, and “Disciple of the Forbidden Spell” attacks “Reflect Bounder”, “Reflect Bounder’s” effect will not activate and no damage will be inflicted.
