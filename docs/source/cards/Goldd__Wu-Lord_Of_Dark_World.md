# GOLDD, WU-LORD OF DARK WORLD  
Also see rulings for “Dark World Monsters”.

*   The second part of this card’s effect targets 2 cards on the opponent’s side of the field. If the opponent chains a card to remove 1 of the 2 targets, the other targeted card is still destroyed.
*   “Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World” must be Special Summoned to resolve the second part of his effect. If you cannot Summon him because you activated “Scapegoat” that turn, or your Monster Card Zones are full, then the second part of his effect does not resolve.
*   If the Special Summon of “Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World” is negated with “Royal Oppression”, the second part of his effect does not resolve.
*   If “Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World” is discarded by your opponent’s card effect, when his effect resolves, he is Special Summoned first, and then the second part of his effect resolves. So the opponent cannot activate “Bottomless Trap Hole” or “Torrential Tribute”; the timing is no longer correct. Also, you could not draw a card for the effect of “Card of Safe Return”.
*   If monsters are targeted by “Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World”, the opponent can chain “My Body as a Shield”.
*   If at least 1 Trap Card is targeted by “Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World”, then the opponent can chain “Fake Trap” and the targeted Trap Card(s) will not be destroyed.
