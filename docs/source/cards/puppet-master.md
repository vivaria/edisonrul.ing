# PUPPET MASTER

> ① When this card is Tribute Summoned you can pay 2000 Life Points to Special Summon 2 Fiend-Type monsters from your Graveyard. They cannot attack this turn.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Paying 2000 Life Points is a cost.
    *   This effect targets 2 Fiend-Type monsters in the Graveyard at activation.
    *   If a target leaves the Graveyard, the other target is still Special Summoned.
    *   If "Skill Drain" is activated later that turn, the Summoned targets still cannot attack that turn.
*   You cannot activate this effect if you don't have 2 or more Fiend-Type monsters in your Graveyard that you can be Special Summoned.
