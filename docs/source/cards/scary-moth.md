# SCARY MOTH

*   Monsters Special Summoned before “Scary Moth” is Summoned do not count for this effect.
*   If you activate “Monster Reborn” while “Scary Moth” and “Black Garden” are face-up on your side of the field, you will be able to Special Summon a monster with “Monster Reborn.”
*   The effect of “Black Garden” will activate, but will be unable to Special Summon a “Rose Token.” The effect to halve the ATK of the monster will be applied.
*   If “Scary Moth” is face-up on the field, you can activate “Monster Reborn” and Chain to it with “Call of the Haunted,” but only “Call of the Haunted” will Special Summon a monster.
*   If your opponent has already Special Summoned this turn and “Scary Moth” is face-up on the field, you may activate “The Shallow Grave.” If you do, only you will Special Summon a monster.
*   If you activate “The Shallow Grave” while “Scary Moth” is face-up on the field, it will count as the one Special Summon per turn for both players.
*   If you Special Summon “Scary Moth” it does not count as your one Special Summon for the turn.
