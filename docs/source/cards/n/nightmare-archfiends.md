### Card Rulings

*   “Remove Brainwashing” will cause “Nightmare Archfiend Tokens” to switch to the control of the player who activated “Nightmare Archfiends”. If that player does not have enough available Monster Card Zone spaces, the extra “Nightmare Archfiend Tokens” are destroyed and the opponent takes damage accordingly. When a “Nightmare Archfiend Token” is destroyed, the effect to inflict damage does not start a chain, so cards like “Barrel Behind the Door” cannot be activated. Tributing a monster is a cost to activate this card.
