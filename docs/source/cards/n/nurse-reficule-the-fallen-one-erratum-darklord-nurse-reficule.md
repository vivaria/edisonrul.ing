### Card Text

> ① Any effect that would cause your opponent to gain Life Points instead inflicts the same amount of damage to your opponent.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies when effects that cause your opponent to gain Life Points resolve.
    *   This effect causes those effects to inflict Effect Damage.
    *   This is not the same as losing Life Points (ex: "Immortal of Thunder").
    *   This effect does not stack. Two copies of "Nurse Reficule" will NOT cause "Upstart Goblin" to inflict 2000 points of Damage, it only converts the 1000 Life Point gain into 1000 points of damage \[[REF](http://web.archive.org/web/20080131140306/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/COMMUNITY/forums/thread/1005905.aspx)\].
*   VS. "Prime Material Dragon": if both "Nurse Reficule" and "Prime Material Dragon" are on the field when Player A's "Upstart Goblin" resolves, Player B will gain 1000 Life Points (gains / damage happen normally) \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=808154)\].
