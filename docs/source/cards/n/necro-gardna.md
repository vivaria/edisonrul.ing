*   The ① Quick Effect can be activated at any time before the End of your opponent's Battle Phase.
    *   You do not choose which attack to negate, it automatically negates the next attack. If this effect is activated in the Battle Step, it negates that attack.
    *   This effect does NOT target the attacking monster.
    *   This card removes itself from play as a cost.
    *   This effect can only negate an attack the turn it was activated.
    *   If multiple "Necro Gardna" are removed from play, they will not each negate one attack. Instead, they will all negate your opponent's next attack.
*   This effect CANNOT be activated during the Damage Step.
*   This effect CANNOT be activated during your turn.
*   VS. "Red Dragon Archfiend": If an attack is negated, with "Magic Cylinder", etc., the monster is destroyed by "Red Dragon Archfiend"'s effect in your End Phase.
*   VS. "Prohibition": you cannot activate the effect of a "Necro Gardna" which was in the Graveyard when "Prohibition" was activated. If a "Necro Gardna" is on the field when "Prohibition" is activated, and later that "Necro Gardna" is sent to the Graveyard, then you can activate the effect of that "Necro Gardna".
