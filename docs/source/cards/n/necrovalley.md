*   "Question", "Fiber Jar", "Penguin Knight", and "Agido" are negated by this card’s ③ effect, even though they don't target (yes, this is weird).

> Konami policy regarding card legality and cards with [erratas](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Errata) (section IX. subsection G. of the [policy document](https://img.yugioh-card.com/en/gameplay/penalty_guide/YGOTCG_Policy_v_2_1.pdf)) state that "you are required to play all copies of your cards according to the most recent text". Therefore, the language used and the consequences of this erratum are essential to authentic Edison Format play.
