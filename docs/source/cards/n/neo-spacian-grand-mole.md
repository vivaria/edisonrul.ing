# Neo-Spacian Grand Mole

> ① If this card battles with your opponent's monster, you can return both monsters to their owners' hands at the start of the Damage Step (without damage calculation).

*   The ① Trigger Effect is OPTIONAL.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 1 - Start of the Damage Step (before face-down monsters are flipped face-up). A face-down Flip Monster that is attacked is returned without activating its effect.
    *   This effect does not target the opponent's monster.
