### Card Rulings

*   This effect activates when the attack is declared. It is a Trigger Effect and can be chained to. The act of drawing and revealing a card is resolved when the Trigger Effect resolves. If a face-down “Neo-Spacian Glow Moss” is attacked, its effect does not activate.
*   The Spell Card effect (“…You can change this attack to a direct attack instead”) only works when “Neo-Spacian Glow Moss” is attacking. Not when it is attacked.
*   If a Spell Card is drawn and revealed, and you choose to convert the attack to a direct attack, it causes a replay.
*   If “Neo-Spacian Glow Moss” attacks directly with its effect and “Skill Drain” is activated in response, “Neo-Spacian Glow Moss” can no longer attack directly and (another) replay will occur.
*   If “Neo-Spacian Glow Moss” is attacking, and a Trap Card is drawn and revealed for its effect, it changes to Defense Position and is no longer considered an attacking monster, so damage calculation is not performed.
*   If a monster attacks a face-down “Ancient Lamp”, and “Ancient Lamp” re-directs the attack to “Neo-Spacian Glow Moss”, the effect of “Neo-Spacian Glow Moss” will not activate, because the effect of “Ancient Lamp” causes it to miss the timing.
*   This effect does not target.
