### Card Text

> ① Destroy 1 face-down Spell or Trap Card and remove it from play. If the card is a Trap Card, both players must check their respective Decks and remove all cards of the same name from play. Then shuffle the Decks.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① effect targets a face-down Spell / Trap Card anywhere on the field.
    *   You can target a face-down monster that is equipped to "Relinquished".
    *   If the target is not destroyed, it is not removed from play, nor are any cards in the Deck(s).
    *   If the target is not face-down, it is not destroyed and no cards are removed from play.
    *   If the target is destroyed, and it was a Trap Card, you and your opponent MUST briefly show each other your Decks to verify that all copies of that Trap Card have been removed \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=822229)\].
        *   This cannot take place using online duel simulators, as it allows opportunity for foul play.
*   VS. "Imperial Iron Wall": Nobleman CANNOT be activated while IWW is active. If IWW is chained to Nobleman, the target is still destroyed but it is not removed from play, nor are any cards in the Deck(s).

### Edison-Accurate PSCT

> ① Target 1 face-down Spell/Trap on the field; destroy that target, and if you do, banish it, then, if it was a Trap, each player banishes all cards with it's name from their deck.

### Card Rulings

*   The card targets 1 face-down Spell/Trap on the field.

*   If the target is not face-down when this effect resolves, it is not destroyed. Neither player reveals their deck or banishes cards.

*   If the target is destroyed, and it was a Trap Card, both players must briefly reveal their decks to verify that all copies of that Trap Card have been banished, unless all legal copies are accounted for.
- When playing on an online manual simulator (e.g. "Dueling Book"), neither player reveals their deck to avoid foul play.

*   vs. "Imperial Iron Wall": This card cannot be activated while the effect of "Imperial Iron Wall" is applying.
- if "Imperial Iron Wall" is chained to this card, the target is still destroyed but neither player reveals their deck or banishes cards.

*   You can target a face-down monster that is equipped to Relinquished.
