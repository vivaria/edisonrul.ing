### Card Text

> ① Once during each of your turns, if you activated a Spell Card, this card gains 1000 ATK during its next attack, for damage calculation only. ② Once per turn, if this attacking card destroys an opponent's monster by battle, you can change 1 face-up Defense Position monster your opponent controls to Attack Position, and attack it with this card.

### Card Rulings

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.
    *   If the Spell Card was activated before "Nitro Warrior" was Summoned, this effect does not apply.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   This effect targets a face-up Defense Position monster your opponent controls.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down / leaves the field, you do not make a second attack.
    *   You only gain 1 additional attack with this effect. "Mirror Force" can be activated in response to that additional attack, and if "Toll" is active you must pay 500 Life Points.
