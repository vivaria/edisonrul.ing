# RE-FUSION

*   You cannot use “Re-Fusion” to Special Summon a Fusion Monster that was Summoned with “Magical Scientist”, or otherwise not properly Fusion Summoned.
*   You can chain to the first part of this card’s effect. However, the last part (that destroys the monster) does not start a chain.
