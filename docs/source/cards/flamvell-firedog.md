# FLAMVELL FIREDOG

> ① When this card destroys an opponent's monster by battle and sends it to the Graveyard, you can Special Summon 1 FIRE monster with 200 or less DEF from your Deck, except "Flamvell Firedog".

*   This ① optional Trigger Effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   This card must be face-up on the field to activate this effect.
    *   This effect will resolve, even if "Flamvell Firedog" leaves the field after activating this effect.
    *   The Monster can be Summoned in either Attack or Defense Position.
    *   The Special Summoned monster can attack during that Battle Phase.
    *   "Torrential Tribute" and "Royal Oppression" CANNOT be activated in the Damage Step.
*   The ① effect DOES NOT activate if:
    *   "Flamvell Firedog" was destroyed battling a monster with equal ATK.
    *   "Flamvell Firedog" is flipped face-down / leaves the field (by "Desertapir" or "D.D. Warrior Lady") earlier in the Damage Step.
