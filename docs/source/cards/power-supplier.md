# POWER SUPPLIER

*   This effect continuously targets each monster you select for as long as “Power Supplier” is face-up on the field.
*   You cannot apply “Power Supplier’s” effect on the same monster targeted during the previous turn.
*   If a monster targeted by “Power Supplier” is affected by “Shrink” or “Megamorph” you recalculate the original ATK of the monster and then reapply the +400 ATK from “Power Supplier.
*   If “Skill Drain” is activated, monsters targeted by “Power Supplier” lose the +400 ATK. If “Skill Drain” is removed from the field, the effect of “Power Supplier” is reapplied and the targeted monsters will regain the +400 ATK.
*   If your opponent gains control of one of your monsters that was targeted by “Power Supplier” it will still gain the ATK.
*   If you target a different monster each turn, all the previously targeted monsters’ ATK remain increased.
