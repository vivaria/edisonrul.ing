# Continuous Destruction Punch

*   "Continuous Destruction Punch" is like "Destruction Punch" except it's a Continuous Spell Card that you activate during your Main Phase.
*   A monster destroyed because of "Continuous Destruction Punch" is destroyed by "Continuous Destruction Punch"'s effect, not "as a result of battle".
*   The determination of whether a monster is destroyed by "Continuous Destruction Punch"'s effect happens at Damage Calculation, so Flip Effects, etc., are resolved AFTER "Continuous Destruction Punch"'s effect destroys a monster (but does not yet send it to the Graveyard). Then, after applying Flip Effects, send a monster destroyed by this card (or by Damage Calculation) to the Graveyard.
