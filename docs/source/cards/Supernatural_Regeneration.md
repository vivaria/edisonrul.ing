# SUPERNATURAL REGENERATION

*   You count Psychic monsters sent to any Graveyard, including your opponent’s.
*   “Zombie World” will change all Psychic monsters into Zombies, including in the Graveyard, so any Psychic monsters sent to the Graveyard will be Zombies instead, and will not count for “Supernatural Regeneration” (in fact, you cannot activate “Supernatural Regeneration” in that case).
*   Effects that change Type on the field, like “DNA Surgery”, will not apply in the Graveyard, so Psychic monsters sent to the Graveyard while “DNA Surgery” is active still count as “Psychic-Type monsters sent to the Graveyard this turn” (so you gain Life Points for them).
*   Returning Psychic monsters to the Graveyard (with “Miracle Dig”, etc.) does not count as “sending” them to the Graveyard, so they do not count for “Supernatural Regeneration”.
*   Even if Psychic monsters sent to the Graveyard are no longer in the Graveyard during the End Phase, they still can count for “Supernatural Regeneration”.
