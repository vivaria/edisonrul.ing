# ALIEN DOG

> ① When you Normal Summon an "Alien" monster, you can Special Summon this card from your hand. ② When you do, place 2 A-Counters on face-up monster(s) your opponent controls.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the hand.
    *   This effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Trap Hole").
    *   If you wish to use this effect, you CANNOT use Ignition Effect Priority in response to the Summon.
    *   This effect can't activate if the Normal Summon happens as Chain Link 2(+) by "Ultimate Offering".
    *   Even if you have more than 1 “Alien Dog” in your hand, you can only activate the effect of 1.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates after the Chain in which the ① effect resolved.
    *   You may place both A-Counters on a single monster, or one on each of two monsters.
    *   The effects of “Alien Dog” do not target. You select the monster(s) when the effect resolves.
