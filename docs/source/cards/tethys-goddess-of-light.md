# Tethys, Goddess Of Light

> ① When you draw a Fairy-Type monster(s), you can reveal 1 of those monsters to draw 1 more card.

*   This ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   1 Fairy-Type monster you JUST drew is revealed to your opponent at activation.
    *   This effect can be activated during the Damage Step.
    *   If you control 2(+) copies of Tethys, their effects can all activate in a single Chain when you draw a single Fairy-Type monster.
    *   This effect cannot activate if you drew a Fairy-Type as Chain Link 2(+).
    *   This effect cannot activate if you draw a Fairy-Type by "Upstart Goblin", which resolves sequentially. The last thing to happen is your opponent gaining 1000 Life Points, not you drawing a Fairy.
