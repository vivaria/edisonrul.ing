# Fake Trap

*   "The face-down Trap Cards protected by "Fake Trap" must be revealed when resolving the effect that would destroy them, to confirm that they are Trap Cards.
*   If your opponent activates "Heavy Storm" and your chain "Fake Trap", your Trap Cards are protected but your Spell Cards are still destroyed."
