# CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE

> Send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard. Add 1 Level 4 or lower "Lightsworn" monster from your Deck to your hand.

*   Sending 3 cards from the top of your Deck to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   Charge cannot be activated while "Dimensional Fissure" / "Macro Cosmos" is active.
*   If the last Level 4 or lower "Lightsworn" in your Deck is sent to the Graveyard as cost, briefly show your Deck to your opponent to verify that no Level 4 or lower "Lightsworn" monsters remain in your Deck.
*   You cannot activate this card if you have 3 or less cards in your Deck.
*   Charge does not target the "Lightsworn" in Deck, it can activate with "[Aurkus, Lightsworn Druid](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Aurkus,_Lightsworn_Druid)" face-up.
