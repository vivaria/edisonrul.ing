*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated.
*   The Ⓤ Unclassified Effect applies in the hand (this Special Summon does not start a Chain).

    *   If "Skill Drain" is activated after "Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler" is Special Summoned, the effect of "Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler" is negated. If "Skill Drain" is later negated or removed from the field, the effect of "Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler" is not reapplied.

If "Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler"'s ATK is less than 1000 when its tails effect resolves, its effect disappears.
