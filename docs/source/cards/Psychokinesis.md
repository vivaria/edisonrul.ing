# PSYCHOKINESIS

*   "Psychokinesis" targets 1 card on the field.
*   Destroying the targeted card and inflicting 1000 damage are considered to happen at the same time.
*   If an effect is chained that removes every Psychic-Type monster from your side of the field, the effect of "Psychokinesis" still resolves.
*   If an effect is chained that removes the targeted card from the field, the damage is not inflicted.
