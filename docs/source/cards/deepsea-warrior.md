# DEEPSEA WARRIOR

*   If you take control of your opponent's face-down "Deepsea Warrior" with "Change of Heart" while "Umi" is face-up on the field, when it is flipped face-up it is immediately returned to your opponent.
*   If you Special Summon "Deepsea Warrior" with "Premature Burial", when "Premature Burial" is destroyed while "Umi" is face-up on the field "Deepsea Warrior" is not destroyed.
*   If a Spell Card is activated that would destroy a face-up "Umi" and a face-up "Deepsea Warrior" simultaneously, "Umi" is destroyed but "Deepsea Warrior" is not.
*   If your opponent has "Messenger of Peace" or "Swords of Revealing Light" face-up on their side of the field, "Deepsea Warrior" can attack if "Umi" is face-up on the field. If your opponent has "Toll", you do not pay. If your opponent has "Gravekeeper's Servant", you do not send a card from the top of your Deck to your Graveyard.
*   If "Deepsea Warrior" is equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" while "Umi" is face-up on the field, the effect of "Ring of Magnetism" is not applied.
*   If your opponent controls a monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" and another monster, you can attack the other monster with "Deepsea Warrior" if "Umi" is face-up on the field.
*   If your opponent has "The Dark Door" face-up on their side of the field, you can attack with one of your monsters and then attack with "Deepsea Warrior" if "Umi" is face-up on the field.
