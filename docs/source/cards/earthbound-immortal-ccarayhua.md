# EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL CCARAYHUA

*   The effect to destroy all cards on the field will activate even during the Damage Step.
*   If this face-down card is attacked while another “Earthbound Immortal” is face-up on the field it will be destroyed, but since it was not destroyed by a card effect it will not destroy all cards on the field.
*   If “Earthbound Immortal Ccarayhua” is destroyed while in your hand or Deck, its effect will activate.
