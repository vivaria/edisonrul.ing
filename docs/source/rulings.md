# Rulings

On this page you will find the text of [Edisonformat.com](https://www.edisonformat.com/)'s [Individual Card Rulings](https://www.edisonformat.com/rulings), reformatted to make the experience easier. 

> The following individual card rulings have been compiled from the archived UDE Gameplay FAQ database \[[REF](https://web.archive.org/web/20090217182013/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/yugioh/en/gameplay/faqs/cardfaqs/default.aspx?first=A&last=C)\] and the Konami Card Rulings documents \[[CRMS](https://ms.yugipedia.com//1/11/Card_Rulings_-_Crimson_Crisis_v2.0.pdf), [RGBT](https://img.yugioh-card.com/uk/gameplay/rulings/RGBT_rules.pdf), [ANPR](https://img.yugioh-card.com/uk/gameplay/rulings/ANPR_rules.pdf), [SOVR](https://img.yugioh-card.com/lat-am/pt/gameplay/rulings/SOVR_sneak_ruling.pdf), [ABPF](https://img.yugioh-card.com/uk/gameplay/rulings/ABPF_rules.pdf), [HA01](https://img.yugioh-card.com/uk/gameplay/rulings/100304%20HA_SDWS_ST09_Rules.pdf), [SDMM](https://img.yugioh-card.com/lat-am/gameplay/rulings/10406SDMachinaMayhem_Rules.pdf)\]. Notable cards have streamlined rulings and additional information cross-referenced against Pojo / Duelistgroundz.  


## 3-HUMP LACOODA  
> ① If there are 3 face-up "3-Hump Lacooda" cards on your side of the field, Tribute 2 of them to draw 3 cards.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
*   You don't have to activate "3-Hump Lacooda"'s effect just because you have 3 copies in play.
*   You can choose which of the "3-Hump Lacoodas"' effects you are activating; it can be one of the ones you are Tributing or the one that is remaining on the field.
*   Tributing 2 "3-Hump Lacoodas" is a cost.
*   If your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" or "Book of Moon" to the activation of "3-Hump Lacooda"'s effect, the effect is not negated.
*   If you Summon your third "3-Hump Lacooda", you can activate its effect before your opponent activates "Torrential Tribute".

  
## 7  
> When there are 3 face-up "7" cards on your side of the field, draw 3 cards from your Deck. Then destroy all "7" cards. When this card is sent directly from the field to your Graveyard, increase your Life Points by 700 points.

*   If you have 3 "7"'s and destroy them all, you get 2100 Life Points.
*   If your opponent also has "7"'s, they are also destroyed.
*   If you have 3 "7"'s and activate their effect, your opponent can chain "Imperial Order" to negate the effect.
*   Each effect of "7" that gives you 700 Life Points goes on a chain, so if multiple "7"'s are sent to the Graveyard simultaneously, each effect is 1 step in the chain.
*   If other cards are also sent to the Graveyard at the same time, like "Sangan" or "Black Pendant", the card controlled by the turn player is Step 1.
*   If your 3rd "7" is activated, but destroyed by "Mystical Space Typhoon" in a chain, you can't activate its effect, but you still gain 700 Life Points for its Graveyard effect.

  
## 8-CLAWS SCORPION  
> ① Once per turn, you can flip this card into face-down Defense Position. ② When this card attacks an opponent's face-down Defense Position monster, this card's ATK becomes 2400 during damage calculation only.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   If you use this effect, then Flip Summon this card: you cannot used this effect again that turn \[[REF](https://www.edisonformat.com/home/basic-strategy-flip-flop-fundamentals)\].
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect is applied if the condition is correct on activation ("8-Claws Scorpion" declared an attack against a face-down Defense Position monster.) The target monster does not have to be in face-down Defense Position when the effect of "8-Claws Scorpion" is resolved. So if "Final Attack Orders" is active, or "Ceasefire" flips the monster face-up, "8-Claws Scorpion" still gets its 2400 ATK.
    *   The ATK of "8-Claws Scorpion" becomes 2400 during damage calculation. You cannot chain "Rush Recklessly" or "Blast with Chain" to this effect. If these cards were activated before damage calculation, then the ATK of "8-Claws Scorpion" becomes 2400 during damage calculation so those cards have no effect on its ATK.
    *   Even if "8-Claws Scorpion" is equipped with an Equip Spell Card, its ATK is 2400 when it attacks a face-down Defense Position monster.

  
## A CAT OF ILL OMEN  
> FLIP: Select 1 Trap Card from your Deck and place it on top of your Deck. If "Necrovalley" is on the field, you can add the selected Trap Card to your hand instead.

*   Show the card to your opponent.
*   If "Imperial Order" & "Necrovalley" are both active, and "A Cat of Ill Omen" is flipped, you add the card to your hand because "Necrovalley" is face-up on the field, even though its effect is negated.
*   If "Mystical Space Typhoon" is chained to the effect to destroy "Necrovalley", so that "Necrovalley" is not on the field when this effect resolves, you cannot place the card in your hand.
*   You select the card for this effect when the effect resolves, not when it activates.

  
## 'A' CELL BREEDING DEVICE  
> ① During each of your Standby Phases, put 1 A-Counter on 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger-like Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   You can select a monster that is unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards as the monster to put an A-Counter on, but the counter will not be placed.

  
## 'A' CELL INCUBATOR  
> ① Each time an A-Counter(s) is removed from play by a card effect, place 1 A-Counter on this card. ② When this card is destroyed, distribute the A-Counters on this card among face-up monsters.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies on the field.
    *   This effect does not use the Chain.
    *   If an A-Counter is removed to pay a cost, an A-Counter is placed upon “’A’ Cell Incubator”.
    *   If an A-Counter on this card is removed by an effect, place an A-Counter upon “’A’ Cell Incubator”.
    *   The effect of “’A’ Cell Incubator” is not applied when A-Counters are removed because the card with the A-Counters was removed from the field or flipped face-down, because these A-Counters are not removed by an effect.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger-like Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard (or banished).
    *   You may place A-Counters on face-up monsters on either field.

  
## 'A' CELL SCATTER BURST  
> Select 1 face-up "Alien" monster you control. Destroy it and distribute new A-Counters equal to its Level among your opponent's face-up monsters.

*   This effect targets 1 face-up “Alien” monster you control.
*   You choose which monsters to put the A-Counters on when this effect resolves.
*   You can distribute the A-Counters however you wish among your opponent’s face-up monsters.
*   You must place exactly as many A-Counters as the Level of the monster targeted by this effect.
*   You cannot activate this card if your opponent controls no face-up monsters.

  
## A DEAL WITH DARK RULER  
> You can only activate this card during a turn in which a Level 8 or higher monster on your side of the field was sent to the Graveyard. Special Summon 1 "Berserk Dragon" from your hand or Deck.

*   The "Level" in "A Deal with Dark Ruler" is the original Level printed on the Monster Card.
*   If your opponent's Level 8 or higher monster than you control is sent to the Graveyard, you can activate "A Deal with Dark Ruler".
*   You cannot activate "A Deal with Dark Ruler" during the Damage Step.
*   You can only Special Summon 1 monster with "A Deal with Dark Ruler", but you can activate 2 copies of "A Deal with Dark Ruler" to Special Summon 1 "Berserk Dragon" for each, even if only 1 Level 8 or higher monster was sent to the Graveyard.
*   You can activate "A Deal with Dark Ruler" if your Level 8 or higher monster that is an Equip Spell Card is sent from your side of the field to the Graveyard (such as "Koitsu" or "Dark Necrofear" destroyed by "Heavy Storm").

  
## A FEATHER OF THE PHOENIX  
> Discard 1 card. Select 1 card from your Graveyard and return it to the top of your Deck.

*   Discarding 1 card is a cost. Your opponent can chain "D.D. Crow".
*   This is an effect that targets.
*   You can target a Fusion / Synchro Monster in the Graveyard, but it is returned to the Extra Deck.
*   You can target the card you discarded for the cost of "A Feather of the Phoenix" to be the card returned to the top of your Deck. If you discarded "Night Assailant" or "Makyura the Destructor", then their effects will activate.

  
## A FEINT PLAN  
> A player cannot attack face-down monsters during this turn.

*   If "A Feint Plan" is activated and you control only face-down monsters, your opponent cannot attack any of your monsters and they cannot attack your Life Points directly either.
*   If you activate "A Feint Plan" after your opponent declares an attack against one of your face-down monsters, that attack resolves as normal, but they cannot attack other face-down monsters for the remainder of the turn. (This is because "A Feint Plan" prevents declaring an attack against a face-down monster, and the attack has already been declared by the time "A Feint Plan" resolves during the Battle Step.)

  
## A HERO EMERGES  
> You can only activate this card when your opponent declares an attack. Your opponent selects 1 random card from your hand. If it is a Monster Card, Special Summon it on your side of the field. If not, send it to the Graveyard.

*   You can Special Summon a high-level monster, like "Dark Magician", with "A Hero Emerges". But if your opponent selects a Special Summon-only monster like "Dark Necrofear", or a Spirit Monster, it is sent to the Graveyard.
*   When "Guardian Elma" is selected for "A Hero Emerges", and you have "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" on your side of the field, you can Special Summon her, but if you don't have it, then she is sent to the Graveyard.
*   You can activate "A Hero Emerges" even if you have only 1 card in your hand.

  
## A LEGENDARY OCEAN  
> Ⓒ This card's name is treated as "Umi". ① Reduce the Level of all WATER monsters in both players' hands and on the field by 1. ② All WATER monsters gain 200 ATK and DEF.

*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated, it applies in the Deck:
    *   You can have 3 cards total in your Deck between "A Legendary Ocean" and "Umi", because this card’s name is treated as "Umi". So you cannot have 3 copies of "Umi" and 3 copies of "A Legendary Ocean" in your Deck.
    *   The name of "A Legendary Ocean" is treated as "Umi" always and for all purposes. If "Imperial Order" is active, the card name is still treated as "Umi". If the opponent activates "Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell" targeting "Umi", you cannot activate "Umi" or "A Legendary Ocean" for the rest of the Duel.
    *   When "A Legendary Ocean" is active, you may activate "Tornado Wall".
*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   When "A Legendary Ocean" is active, you may Summon or Set Level 5 WATER Monsters from your hand, since they are treated as being Level 4 monsters. If you Set a Level 5 WATER monster you do not have to show your opponent.
    *   When the effect of "Cyber Jar" is activated and "A Legendary Ocean" is on the field, you cannot Special Summon Level 5 WATER monsters picked-up by the effect of "Cyber Jar". This is because the effect of "A Legendary Ocean" does not include Monster Cards in the Deck.
    *   If "A Legendary Ocean" and "Gravity Bind" are active, you may attack with Level 4 WATER monsters (being treated as Level 3). If "A Legendary Ocean" is destroyed after an attack is declared, a replay occurs because the Level 4 WATER monster can no longer attack.
    *   If "A Legendary Ocean" and "Infinite Dismissal" are active, and you Summon a Level 4 WATER monster (being treated as Level 3), it will be destroyed during the End Phase.
*   The ② Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   When "A Legendary Ocean" is active, "The Legendary Fisherman" on the field is unaffected by Spell Cards, so it does not receive the ATK/DEF bonus or have its Level reduced by 1. It still is treated as Level 4 in your hand, so you may Summon it without Tribute.
    *   "A Legendary Ocean" does not have the effect of "Umi" that increases/decreases the ATK and DEF of specific monster Types.

  
## A MAN WITH WDJAT  
> ① When you Normal Summon this card, and during each of your Standby Phases, select 1 Set card on your opponent's side of the field. Pick it up and look at it, then return it to its original position.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
*   If you Set "A Man with Wdjat", its effect is not activated.
*   Any effects of the card you look at are not activated when you look at them with "A Man with Wdjat" (such as a Flip Effect, or if it is a Trap Card, etc.).

  
## A RIVAL APPEARS!  
> Select 1 face-up monster your opponent controls. Special Summon 1 monster from your hand that has the same Level as the selected monster.

*   For the effect of “A Rival Appears!”, refer to the levels of the monster on the field and the monster in the hand at the time “A Rival Appears!” resolves (for purposes of “Cost Down”, “Level Conversion Lab”, “Mystical Space Typhoon” in a chain destroying “Demotion”, etc.)
*   If the opponent’s monster is face-down or not on the field when “A Rival Appears!” resolves, then its effect disappears.
*   If you do not have a monster of the same level as the target, you cannot activate “A Rival Appears!”

  
## A WINGBEAT OF GIANT DRAGON  
> Return 1 face-up Level 5 or higher Dragon-Type monster you control to the owner's hand and destroy all Spell and Trap Cards.

*   "A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon" targets 1 Level 5 or higher Dragon-Type monster.
*   If you target a Level 5 or higher Dragon-Type Fusion / Synchro Monster, it is returned to the Extra Deck.
*   If the target is flipped face-down / leaves the field / has its Monster Type changed, "A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon"'s effect disappears.

  
## ABARE USHIONI  
> ① Once per turn, you can toss a coin and call it. If you call it right, inflict 1000 damage to your opponent. If you call it wrong, you take 1000 damage.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
*   If you call the coin toss wrong for “Abare Ushioni” you can still prevent the damage with “Pikeru’s Circle of Enchantment”, etc.
*   You cannot chain “Barrel Behind the Door” to the effect of “Abare Ushioni” because you don’t know yet if you will take damage or not from the effect.

  
## ABSOLUTE END  
> Activate only during your opponent's turn. This turn, the attacks from your opponent's monsters become direct attacks.

*   When "Absolute End" is activated during an attack, that attack becomes a direct attack.
*   If "Taunt" and "Absolute End" are both active, the attack becomes a direct attack to your Life Points. This is because the attack target is the monster selected by "Taunt", but then "Absolute End" turns it into a direct attack.

  
## ABSORBING KID FROM THE SKY  
> ① When this card destroys a monster and sends it to the Graveyard as a result of battle, increase your Life Points by the Level of the destroyed monster x 300 points.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   This card must be face-up on the field to activate this effect \[[REF](https://www.edisonformat.com/home/basic-strategy-will-it-trigger)\].
    *   The Level is the original Level printed on the card.

  
## ABYSSAL DESIGNATOR  
> Pay 1000 Life Points. Declare a Type and an Attribute. Your opponent must send 1 monster with both the declared Type and Attribute from their hand or Deck to the Graveyard.

*   If your opponent sends a monster to the Graveyard with the declared Type and Attribute, you cannot see their hand and Deck. But if they claim to have no such card, you can check their hand and Deck to confirm.

  
## ACID TRAP HOLE  
> Select 1 face-down Defense Position monster. Flip it face-up, and if the DEF of the monster is 2000 points or less, destroy the monster. If the DEF is more than 2000 points, return the monster to face-down Defense Position.

*   A face-down "Jinzo" will be destroyed by this card.
*   If the monster flipped face-up has an effect that changes its DEF, such as "Enraged Muka Muka", calculate the current DEF, then determine if it will be destroyed or flipped back face-down. So if you had 4 cards in your hand, "Enraged Muka Muka" would not be destroyed.
*   If the targeted monster has a Flip Effect, that Effect is activated whether the DEF is greater than 2000 or not. If the DEF of the selected monster is 2000 or less, such as a "Hane-Hane", it can not select itself for its Flip Effect since it is destroyed.

  
## ADHESION TRAP HOLE  
> Activate only when your opponent Summons a monster(s). While that monster(s) is face-up on the field, its original ATK is halved.

*   "Adhesion Trap Hole" works against "a monster or monsters", so "Adhesion Trap Hole" does NOT target.
*   When "Cyber Jar" is activated, you may use "Adhesion Trap Hole" against all monsters your opponent Special Summons in face-up Attack Position, but "Adhesion Trap Hole" has no effect on any monsters your opponent Special Summons face-down.
*   "Adhesion Trap Hole" cannot affect monsters Special Summoned face-down with "The Shallow Grave", "Morphing Jar #2", etc.
*   If a monster affected by "Adhesion Trap Hole" is flipped face-down (with "Book of Moon", etc.), "Adhesion Trap Hole"'s effect disappears and the monster's ATK is back to normal.
*   "Adhesion Trap Hole" halves the original ATK, so if you activate another effect that alters ATK, halve the original ATK first and then resolve the other ATK-modifying effect.
*   If a monster affected by "Adhesion Trap Hole" is then equipped with "Megamorph", only "Megamorph"'s effect applies.

  
## ADHESIVE EXPLOSIVE  
> ① If an opponent's monster attacks this face-down Defense Position card, this card becomes an Equip Card equipped to the attacking monster, without applying damage calculation. ② Destroy the equipped monster during the Standby Phase of your opponent's next turn.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 3 - Before Damage Calculation.
    *   If “Mystic Swordsman LV2” attacks, its effect will not activate.
    *   If “Drillroid” attacks it, its effect will activate.
    *   If this face-down card is attacked by “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6” or “Guardian Kay’est”, it will still be equipped to the attacker, but it will not destroy the equipped monster during the Standby Phase.
*   The ② Continuous-like Effect applies on the field.
    *   This effect is treated as the effect of an Equip Spell Card.

  
## ADVANCE DRAW  
> Tribute 1 face-up Level 8 or higher monster you control. Draw 2 cards.

*   Tributing 1 face-up Level 8 or higher monster is a cost.

  
## ADVANCE FORCE  
> ① You can Tribute 1 Level 5 or higher monster to Tribute Summon a Level 7 or higher monster.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies on the field.
    *   You can still Tribute 2 monsters to Tribute Summon a Level 7 or higher monster if you want to.
    *   Only the controller of “Advance Force” gets the effect.

  
## ADVANCED RITUAL ART  
> Select 1 Ritual Monster in your hand. Send Normal Monsters from your Deck to the Graveyard whose total Levels are equal to that Ritual Monster's. Ritual Summon a card with the name of the selected Ritual Monster from your hand.

*   This effect does not target anything.
*   You choose the Ritual Monster you want to Ritual Summon when the effect resolves.
*   You send the Normal Monsters from your Deck to the Graveyard when the effect resolves.

  
## AEGIS OF THE OCEAN DRAGON LORD  
> Until the End Phase of this turn, face-up Level 3 or lower WATER monsters you control cannot be destroyed by battle or by card effects.

*   You can still activate this card even if you control no face-up Level 3 or lower WATER monsters at the time.
*   This effect is applied until you choose to end it during the End Phase.
*   This effect applies to all Level 3 or lower WATER monsters you control, even ones that you Summon after this card’s resolution.

  
## AFTER GENOCIDE  
> This card can only be activated during Main Phase 1. All monsters on both sides of the field that have been involved in damage calculation are destroyed during the End Step of the turn.

*   This card's title has been changed to "After the Struggle". If you have a card titled "After Genocide" its name is treated as "After the Struggle".
*   Even if the Battle Damage is reduced to 0 by the effect of "Waboku", "Kuriboh", "Sanga of the Thunder", etc., both the attacking and defending monster are still destroyed during the End Step by this card’s effect.
*   If you activate "After the Struggle", even a monster that performs a direct attack will be destroyed by this card’s effect during the End Step.
*   Note that "After the Struggle" will destroy monsters during the End Step, not the End Phase.

  
## AFTER THE STRUGGLE  
> This card can only be activated during Main Phase 1. All monsters on both sides of the field that have been involved in damage calculation are destroyed during the End Step of the turn.

*   This card's title has been changed to "After the Struggle". If you have a card titled "After Genocide" its name is treated as "After the Struggle".
*   Even if the Battle Damage is reduced to 0 by the effect of "Waboku", "Kuriboh", "Sanga of the Thunder", etc., both the attacking and defending monster are still destroyed during the End Step by this card’s effect.
*   If you activate "After the Struggle", even a monster that performs a direct attack will be destroyed by this card’s effect during the End Step.
*   Note that "After the Struggle" will destroy monsters during the End Step, not the End Phase.

  
## AGAINST THE WIND  
> Select 1 "Blackwing" monster in your Graveyard. Take damage equal to the ATK of the selected monster, and add it to your hand.

*   “Against the Wind” targets 1 “Blackwing” monster in your Graveyard.
*   If you control “Des Wombat,” you can activate “Against the Wind,” but since the damage you take becomes 0, you cannot add a card to your hand.
*   If an effect is chained that removes the targeted monster from the Graveyard, you take no damage and do not add it to your hand.
*   The effects of “Against the Wind” to inflict damage and add a card to your hand are considered to be simultaneous, although as a practical matter you take the damage first.
    *   This means that you can activate effects like “Numinous Healer” without missing the timing.

  
## AGIDO  
> ① When this card is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle, roll a six-sided die. You can Special Summon 1 Fairy-Type monster from your Graveyard whose Level is equal to the number rolled. (If the result is 6, you can Special Summon a Level 6 or higher monster.)

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   "Agido" can Special Summon itself.
    *   This effect does not target.

  
## AIRKNIGHT PARSHATH  
> ① During battle between this attacking card and a Defense Position monster whose DEF is lower than the ATK of this card, inflict the difference as Battle Damage to your opponent. ② When this card inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent, draw 1 card.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies while this card is attacking.
    *   This effect will not apply if "Total Defense Shogun" attacks this card from Defense Position.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation.
    *   Drawing a card is not optional. You must draw 1 card any time "Airknight Parshath" inflicts Battle Damage to the opponent’s Life Points. This includes direct attacks, and when it battles with a monster with a lower ATK or DEF.
    *   If the opponent activates "Waboku" or "Kuriboh" to reduce the Battle Damage to 0, you do not draw.
    *   When "Airknight Parshath" attacks a face-down monster with a Flip Effect and inflicts Battle Damage, you draw 1 card before the Flip Effect is activated (in Substep 6 - Resolve Effects).

  
## ALCHEMY CYCLE  
> The original ATK of all face-up monsters you control becomes 0, until the End Phase. Each time a monster that had its original ATK reduced to 0 by this effect is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, draw 1 card.

*   Monsters with an original ATK that is already 0 are not affected by "Alchemy Cycle". You will not draw a card when they are destroyed by battle.
*   The effect to draw 1 card starts a Chain.
*   Monsters Summoned or flipped face-up after "Alchemy Cycle" resolves will not have their original ATK become 0.

  
## ALIEN AMMONITE  
> ① When this card is Normal Summoned, you can Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower "Alien" monster from your Graveyard. Destroy it during the End Phase.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates in the Summon response timing.
    *   The effect targets one Level 4 or lower "Alien" Monster in your Graveyard.
    *   Destroy the Summoned monster in the End Phase (this does not start a chain), even if “Alien Ammonite” is not on the field.

  
## ALIEN BRAIN  
> Activate only when a Reptile-Type monster you control is destroyed by battle with an opponent's attacking monster and sent to the Graveyard. Take control of the attacking monster, and treat it as a Reptile-Type monster.

*   This effect does not target.
*   The destroyed monster must be Reptile-Type while on the field AND in the Graveyard.
    *   Use this card in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step after placing Trigger Effects on the Chain.
*   You take control of your opponent’s monster permanently.
    *   If it is flipped face-down, you keep control but it is no longer treated as a Reptile-Type monster.
*   You can take control of Reptile-Type monsters with this card.
    *   If you control your opponent’s Reptile-Type monster and it is destroyed and sent to their Graveyard you can activate “Alien Brain.”

  
## ALIEN DOG  
> ① When you Normal Summon an "Alien" monster, you can Special Summon this card from your hand. ② When you do, place 2 A-Counters on face-up monster(s) your opponent controls.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the hand.
    *   This effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Trap Hole").
    *   If you wish to use this effect, you CANNOT use Ignition Effect Priority in response to the Summon.
    *   This effect can't activate if the Normal Summon happens as Chain Link 2(+) by "Ultimate Offering".
    *   Even if you have more than 1 “Alien Dog” in your hand, you can only activate the effect of 1.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates after the Chain in which the ① effect resolved.
    *   You may place both A-Counters on a single monster, or one on each of two monsters.
    *   The effects of “Alien Dog” do not target. You select the monster(s) when the effect resolves.

  
## ALIEN GREY  
> FLIP: Place 1 A-Counter on 1 face-up monster on your opponent's side of the field. (① If a monster with an A-Counter battles an "Alien" monster, it loses 300 ATK and DEF for each A-Counter during damage calculation only.) ② After this card has been flipped face-up, when it is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, draw 1 card.

*   The Flip Effect is mandatory.
*   The ① Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   If this card is not on the field, a monster with an A-Counter won't lose ATK when battling an "Alien".
    *   If 2 "Alien Grey" (or other monsters with the A-Counter text) are on the field, then a monster with 1 A-Counter will lose 600 ATK while battling an "Alien".
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   The effect to draw a card when "Alien Grey" has been flipped face-up is activated even if it had been flipped face-up earlier in the Duel (including Flip Summoned or being changed face-up by a card effect). It does not have to be flipped face-up as a result of the battle that destroyed it.

  
## ALIEN HUNTER  
> ① If this card destroys a monster with an A-Counter by battle, it can attack once again in a row.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   You can also end the Battle Phase without attacking again by this effect.
*   "Alien Hunter" does not have the A-Counter ATK reduction effect. So if it is the only "Alien" you control, and it battles a monster with an A-Counter, that opposing monster will NOT lose 300 ATK.

  
## ALIEN HYPNO

    *   If you take control of your opponent’s monster with “Alien Hypno” and “Skill Drain” is activated, control of the selected monster is returned to the opponent. If “Skill Drain” is later negated or removed from the field, the selected monster is returned to your control.
    *   If you take control of your opponent’s monster with “Alien Hypno” and afterwards “Alien Hypno” is flipped face-down, every monster that you are controlling with “Alien Hypno’s” effect is returned to your opponent.

    *   Monsters that are Special Summoned face-down are also changed to face-up Attack Position.

## AMAZONESS ARCHERS  
> You can activate this card when your opponent declares an attack and if there is a monster(s) on your side of the field that includes "Amazoness" in its card name, or is named "Amazon Archer". All monsters on your opponent's side of the field are changed to face-up Attack Position (Flip Effects are not activated), and as long as they remain face-up on the field, their ATK(s) are decreased by 500 points. Your opponent must attack with all of his/her monsters.

*   "These monsters" means all of your opponent's face-up monsters on the field at the time "Amazoness Archers" resolves, not just the monsters that were flipped by "Amazoness Archers"' effect.
*   If you activate "Amazoness Archers" during the Battle Phase and your opponent Special Summons another monster afterwards (such as with "Call of the Haunted", or if "Cyber Jar" is flipped), the newly-Summoned monster is not affected by "Amazoness Archers" and does not suffer the -500 ATK reduction nor does it have to attack.
*   The -500 ATK applies to each monster as long as that monster remains face-up on the field. You can activate multiple "Amazoness Archers" and the ATK reductions are cumulative (so -1000 ATK with 2 copies).
*   "Amazoness Archers" vs. "Cat's Ear Tribe": the ATK is 200.
*   If "Fushioh Richie" or "Otohime" are flipped face-up by "Amazoness Archers' effect, their effects are activated because their effects are not Flip Effects; their effects begin a new chain that resolves after the current chain.
*   If a face-down "Jinzo" is flipped by "Amazoness Archers", "Amazoness Archers"' effect is not negated.
*   The effect of "Amazoness Archers" will make your opponent have to attack with all of his monsters if he has multiple monsters on his side of the field. If "Amazoness Archers" is in effect, and later a replay occurs, your opponent cannot choose not to attack.
*   Monsters that have already attacked cannot attack again. If "The Dark Door" is active, your opponent still can only attack with 1 monster. Monsters which cannot attack still cannot attack (Toon Monsters the turn they are Summoned, "Ultimate Obedient Fiend" under the wrong conditions, etc.) If "Diffusion Wave-Motion" is in effect, only the monster affected by "Diffusion Wave-Motion" can attack. The ATK reduction of "Amazoness Archers" is still applied in these cases where monsters cannot attack.
*   If you activate "Amazoness Archers" and chain "Magic Cylinder", "Magic Cylinder" does the full damage before the -500 ATK is applied; your opponent's other monsters must attack normally. If you chain "Amazoness Archers" to "Magic Cylinder", the ATK is reduced first and then "Magic Cylinder" does damage.
*   If either player chains "Negate Attack" to "Amazoness Archers", the Battle Phase ends because of "Negate Attack"'s effect.

  
## AMAZONESS BLOWPIPER  
> ① Select 1 face-up monster on your opponent's side of the field during each of your Standby Phases. Decrease the ATK of the selected monster by 500 points until the end of this turn.

    *   This effect targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.
    *   When a monster selected for "Amazoness Blowpiper"'s effect is flipped face-down, the effect is reset.
    *   After selecting a monster with "Amazoness Blowpiper"'s effect, if "Amazoness Blowpiper" is flipped face-down or removed from the field, its effect still applies until the end of the turn.

  
## AMAZONESS CHAIN MASTER  
> ① When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, you can pay 1500 Life Points to look at your opponent's hand, select 1 Monster Card in it, and add that card to your hand.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   If you get your opponent’s monster with “Amazoness Chain Master” and it’s placed on the field, and later returned to the hand with “Penguin Soldier”, it returns to the original owner’s hand.
    *   You cannot activate the effect of “Amazoness Chain Master” if your opponent has no hand.
    *   If you have your opponent’s monster that you acquired with “Amazoness Chain Master”, and your opponent activates “Disturbance Strategy”, the monster returns to the owner’s Deck. However, you draw the same number of cards that you had in your hand, including 1 card for the monster you acquired with “Amazoness Chain Master”.
    *   If you acquired your opponent’s monster with “Amazoness Chain Master”, and “Remove Brainwashing” is activated, the monster returns to the original owner if it is on the field. However, if it’s still in your hand then it is not returned.
    *   If you acquire your opponent’s monster with “Amazoness Chain Master” and your opponent uses “Lightforce Sword” on it, it returns to your hand (not the owner’s hand) after the effect of “Lightforce Sword” expires.

  
## AMAZONESS FIGHTER

*   The ATK of this card should be 1500 ATK (this card had 1300 ATK when first printed \[[REF](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Card_Errata:Amazoness_Fighter)\]).
*   If "Dark Ruler Ha Des" attacks "Amazoness Fighter", the effect of "Amazoness Fighter" is still applied.
*   When "Amazoness Fighter" battles "Amazoness Swordswoman", the damage to Life Points is zero.
*   When a monster quipped with "Wicked-Breaking Flamberge - Baou" attacks "Amazoness Fighter" or "Amazoness Swordswoman", the effects of the Amazonesses are applied.

  
## AMAZONESS PALADIN  
> ① Increase the ATK of this monster by 100 for each monster on your side of the field that includes "Amazoness" in its name, or is named "Amazon Archer".

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
*   "Amazoness Paladin" counts herself in her effect, so even by herself she gains +100 ATK.

  
## AMAZONESS SPELLCASTER  
> Until the end of this turn, switch the original ATK of 1 face-up monster on your side of field that includes "Amazoness" in its card name or is named "Amazon Archer", with the original ATK of 1 face-up monster on your opponent's side of the field.

*   "Amazoness Spellcaster" targets (it targets 2 monsters), so when you activate "Amazoness Spellcaster" you select 1 face-up Amazoness on your side of the field and 1 face-up monster on your opponent's side of the field.
*   You can select "Gradius' Option" as the other monster, and the original ATK of the Amazoness will now be the ATK of "Gradius' Option" at the time "Amazoness Spellcaster" resolves. The ATK of "Gradius' Option" remains as the ATK of "Gradius" and does not become the ATK of the Amazoness.
*   If you activate "Amazoness Spellcaster", and chain "Dramatic Rescue", "Amazoness Spellcaster"'s effect disappears.
*   If you switch ATKs with "Amazoness Spellcaster", and one of the monsters is equipped with "Megamorph", after the switch, you change the ATK of the monster that is equipped with "Megamorph" using the effect of "Megamorph". With "Shield & Sword", since these are both Normal Spell Cards, you resolve them in the order of their activation, and recalculate their ATKs in that order.
*   If either of the targeted monsters is affect by "Shrink" before "Amazoness Spellcaster" resolves, the ATK values printed on the monsters will be switched, and the effect of "Shrink" effectively disappears. If a monster that has its original ATK changed by "Amazoness Spellcaster" is affected by "Shrink", its ATK will become half of the changed original ATK.

  
## AMAZONESS SWORDS WOMAN  
> ① The opponent takes all Battle Damage to this card's controller that he/she would have taken from a battle involving this card.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
*   "Amazoness Swordswoman" only applies her effect to Battle Damage to her controller, so if attacked by a stronger monster, the "Amazoness Swordswoman" herself is still destroyed as normal.
*   Damage inflicted to the opponent when "Amazoness Swordswoman"'s effect is activated is Battle Damage, so the opponent cannot use "Barrel Behind the Door".
*   When "Dark Ruler Ha Des" attacks "Amazoness Swordswoman", the effect of "Amazoness Swordswoman" is still resolved.
*   When a monster affected by "Diffusion Wave-Motion" attacks "Amazoness Swordswoman", the "Amazoness Swordswoman"'s effect is applied and the opponent (who used "Diffusion Wave-Motion") takes the damage dealt to Life Points. Likewise, the controller of "Spear Dragon" takes damages when "Spear Dragon" battles "Amazoness Swordswoman" (or the controller of a monster equipped with "Fairy Meteor Crush", or who used "Meteorain").
*   When the controller of "Amazoness Swordswoman" uses "Kuriboh", the controller takes zero Battle Damage so no damage is dealt to the opponent.
*   When "Susa Soldier" battles "Amazoness Swordswoman", the controller of "Susa Soldier" takes full damage; the damage is NOT halved.

  
## AMAZONESS TIGER  
> ① You can only have 1 "Amazoness Tiger" on your side of the field. ② Increase the ATK of this card by 400 points for each monster on your side of the field that includes "Amazoness" in its name, or is named "Amazon Archer". ③ As long as this card remains face-up on the field, your opponent cannot attack another monster that includes "Amazoness" in its name, or is named "Amazon Archer".

*   The ① Unclassified Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field (like a Continuous Effect).
    *   If you have an "Amazoness Tiger" face-up, you can Set another "Amazoness Tiger" face-down. If the face-down "Amazoness Tiger" is flipped face-up by an attack, the flipped "Amazoness Tiger" is destroyed after damage calculation. If the face-down "Amazoness Tiger" is flipped with "Swords of Revealing Light", etc., the flipped "Amazoness Tiger" is destroyed but the original "Amazoness Tiger" is not.
    *   If both players control a face-up "Amazoness Tiger" and you use "Snatch Steal" on your opponent's "Amazoness Tiger", then that "Amazoness Tiger" is destroyed after coming to your side of the field.
    *   If both players have a face-up "Amazoness Tiger" and you give your opponent your "Amazoness Tiger" with "Creature Swap", then your "Amazoness Tiger" is destroyed.
    *   If both players give their "Amazoness Tigers" to each other with "Creature Swap", neither is destroyed.
    *   If you pick up 2 "Amazoness Tigers" with "Cyber Jar", you must place both face-down, or place 1 face-up and 1 face-down.
*   The ① Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   "Amazoness Tiger" increases its own ATK.
    *   You can use "Bottomless Trap Hole" against "Amazoness Tiger" because its ATK is at least 1500 when Summoned.
*   The ② Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   When you have "Amazoness Tiger" and another Amazoness equipped with "Raregold Armor", your opponent cannot attack.
    *   When you have "Amazoness Tiger" and another Amazoness equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", the Amazoness equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" can and must be the target of the attack.

  
## AMBULANCEROID

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   You can Special Summon “Dark Jeroid” with “Ambulanceroid’s” effect because it has “roid” in its card name.
    *   If you add 2 "roid" monsters to your hand with "Expressroid"'s effect while you control this card, you can activate its effect to Special Summon both "roid" monsters.

  
## AMBUSH FANGS  
> Activate only when a face-up "Venom" monster you control is declared as an attack target. Negate the attack and end the Battle Phase. Then place 1 Venom Counter on the monster that attacked.

*   This card’s effect to “…end the Battle Phase.” causes play to enter the End Step of the Battle Phase. The Venom Counter is placed on the monster that attacked, then any other effects that happen “at the end of the Battle Phase” are resolved.
*   If you activate "Ambush Fangs", and the attacking monster's attack is negated by a card chained to "Ambush Fangs ("Negate Attack", etc.), you cannot place a Venom Counter on the monster that attacked.

  
## AMEBA  
> ① When this card is face-up on the field and control shifts to your opponent, inflict 2000 points of damage to your opponent's Life Points. Ⓒ This effect can only be used once as long as this card remains face-up on the field.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This card’s effect is not activated when equipped to an opponent’s "Relinquished".
    *   If your opponent uses "Mind Control" on a face-down "Ameba" and Flip Summons it, when it returns to you during the End Phase, its effect activates and you take 2000 damage.
*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated.
    *   The Ⓒ Condition is reset if this card is flipped face-down / leaves the field.

  
## AMPHIBIOUS BUGROTH MK-3  
> ① While "Umi" is face-up on the field, this card can attack your opponent's Life Points directly.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   When "Umi" is on the field, and "Amphibious Bugroth MK-3" declares a direct attack, and "Umi" is destroyed during the Battle Step, "Amphibious Bugroth MK-3" can no longer attack directly, so a replay occurs.

  
## AMPLIFIER  
> Equip only to "Jinzo". While this card is equipped, the equipped monster's effect does not negate the effects of its controller's Trap Cards. When this card is removed from the field, destroy the equipped monster. This card's activation and effect cannot be negated.

*   Note that "Amplifier"'s activation and effect cannot be negated. This is written on the card.
*   It is the controller of "Jinzo" equipped with "Amplifier", not the controller of "Amplifier", that can activate Trap Cards.
*   If you equip "Amplifier" to your opponent's "Jinzo", then your opponent can activate Trap Cards and they will not be negated.
*   If you control 2 "Jinzos" and only 1 is equipped with "Amplifier", you cannot activate Trap Cards.
*   If you have "Jinzo with Amplifier", your Trap Cards are not negated and their effects are applied, including "Aqua Chorus", "Royal Command", "Royal Oppression", "Coffin Seller", "Forced Requisition", "Mirror Wall", "Gravity Bind", "Rivalry of Warlords", "Minor Goblin Official", "Final Attack Orders", "Pitch Black Power Stone", "Bad Reaction to Simochi", "Skull Invitation", "Skull Lair", "The Eye of Truth", "Spirit Invitation", "Respect Play", "Ring of Destruction", "Metalmorph", "Torrential Tribute", "Self-Destruct Button", "Zero Gravity", and "Big Burn".
*   If you activate "Mask of Restrict" and you have "Jinzo" with "Amplifier", "Mask of Restrict" is not negated and its effect still applies, so neither player may Tribute.
*   If the controller of "Jinzo" with "Amplifier" has activated the effects of "Regulation of Tribe", "Spatial Collapse", "Robbin' Goblin", "Robbin' Zombie", "Curse of Darkness", etc., their effects are not negated, but if the opponent activates them, they ARE negated.
*   If your "Amplifier" is switched from your "Jinzo" to your opponent's "Jinzo" with "Tailor of the Fickle", then your Jinzo is not destroyed.
*   You cannot activate a card that would cause an infinite loop because its effect cannot resolve completely. Example #1: You activate "Snatch Steal" targeting your opponent's "Jinzo". You then equip "Jinzo" with "Amplifier". You cannot activate "Imperial Order" because it cannot resolve completely (it would negate "Snatch Steal", returning "Jinzo" to your opponent, which would negate "Imperial Order" so "Snatch Steal" would re-activate). If you activate "Imperial Order" by mistake in such a situation, flip it face-down again. Example #2: you control "Jinzo" equipped with "Amplifier" and "Skill Drain". Your opponent cannot activate "Royal Decree".

  
## AMULET OF AMBITION

    *   If a monster of the declared Type is Summoned, then flipped face-down (by "Book of Moon") and face-up again (by "Book of Taiyou"), it CAN attack because the non-attack effect was reset AND because flipping it face-up with "Book of Taiyou" was NOT a Flip Summon.

    *   When "Arsenal Bug" is Summoned and there are no other Insect-Type monsters on your side of the field, "Bottomless Trap Hole" can't activate because its ATK is 1000 when Summoned.

    *   This is treated as the effect of a Trap Card, not an Equip Spell Card.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   This card must be face-up on the field to activate & resolve this effect.

> You can only activate this card when you take damage to your Life Points. Inflict 700 points of damage to your opponent's Life Points. Also, inflict 300 points of damage to your opponent's Life Points for each "Attack and Receive" card in your Graveyard.

*   This card can be activated when the last thing to happen was inflicting Battle / Effect Damage.
    *   This can activate in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation, after adding Trigger Effects to the Chain.
    *   This effect resolves simultaneously: "_Inflict 700 points of damage to your opponent's Life Points_" and "_Also, inflict 300 points of damage to your opponent's Life Points for each "Attack and Receive" card in your Graveyard._" are considered to happen at the same time.
*   You cannot activate this card when you pay Life Points as cost.
*   You cannot activate this card when you take effect damage as Chain Link 2(+), or as the first part of an effect that resolves sequentially (like "Armored Axon Kicker").

  
## ATTACK OF THE CORNERED RAT  
> ① If a Level 3 or lower Normal Monster you control battles, during the Damage Step you can pay Life Points in multiples of 100. The ATK of the opponent's monster is reduced by the amount of Life Points you paid, until the End Phase. (You cannot pay more Life Points than the ATK of the opponent's monster.)

*   You cannot flip “Attack of the Cornered Rat” face-up during the Damage Step unless you would also activate its effect at the same time (by paying Life Points).
*   If “Attack of the Cornered Rat” is removed from the field before the End Phase, the ATK reduction remains until the End Phase, as normal.

  
## ATTACK PHEROMONES  
> If a monster you control attacks a Defense Position monster, change that monster to face-up Attack Position at the end of the Damage Step if your attacking monster is Reptile-Type.

## AURKUS, LIGHTSWORN DRUID  
> ① "Lightsworn" monsters cannot be targeted by effects. ② During each of your End Phases, send the top 2 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies so long as this card is face-up on the field.
    *   Card Effects can't target "Lightsworn" monsters on either field / Graveyard / banished.
    *   "Lightsworn" monsters can't become equipped with Equip Spells. If they were already Equipped before Aurkus' effect applied, those Equip Cards remain on the field and are unaffected.
    *   This does NOT negate effects; it only prevents "Lightsworn" monsters from being targeted.
        *   Ex: If "Raigeki Break" targets a your "Lightsworn" monster and you chain "Glorious Illusion" to Special Summon "Aurkus, Lightsworn Druid", your "Lightsworn" monster is still destroyed.
    *   VS. "Kycoo, the Ghost Destroyer": If Kycoo destroys Aurkus by battle and inflicts Battle Damage, Kycoo's Trigger Effect can activate in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation, but it can't target "Lightsworn" monsters. This is because monsters with Continuous Effects that are destroyed by battle only cease to apply those Continuous Effects in Substep 6 - Resolve Effects..
    *   If you Special Summon a "Lightsworn" monster with "Glorious Illusion", and afterwards you Summon "Aurkus, Lightsworn Druid", if your opponent later destroys "Glorious Illusion" your "Lightsworn" monster is also destroyed because "Glorious Illusion" is NOT targeting your "Lightsworn" monster.
*   The ② Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   If the activation of this effect is negated (by "Light and Darkness Dragon"), this effect will activate again until it resolves (even if it resolves without effect due to "Skill Drain") \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
    *   If you only have 1 card in your Deck when resolving this effect, it is sent to the Graveyard.
    *   This card MUST be face-up on the field to activate AND resolve this effect.
    *   If you resolve this effect and your opponent activates "Book of Eclipse", after "Book of Eclipse" flips this affected monster face-up (and you draw 1 card), this effect must activate again \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=678963)\].
    *   VS. "Brain Control": Player A gains control of Player B's "Lightsworn" monster until the End Phase. During the End Phase, Player A decides when to activate / resolve each effect:
        1.  Player A can resolve "Brain Control" first, returning the "Lightsworn" monster to Player B. That "Lightsworn" monster is no longer controlled by the turn player, its effect won't activate.
        2.  Player A can activate the "Lightsworn"'s Trigger Effect to mill cards from their Deck. Then, Player A resolves "Brain Control" and returns the "Lightsworn" monster to Player B \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=653322)\].
    *   VS. "Enemy Controller":
        *   On Player A's turn, Player B takes control of Player A's "Lightsworn" monster. During the End Phase, "Enemy Controller"'s effect wears off and control of the "Lightsworn" monster returns to Player A, then that Lightsworns's mandatory Trigger Effect activates \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/85182-judgment-dragon-and-enemy-controller/)\].

  
## AUSSA THE EARTH CHARMER  
> FLIP: Take control of 1 EARTH monster on your opponent's side of the field, for as long as this card remains face-up on the field.

*   The FLIP Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates (starting a Chain) even if there isn't a legal target on the field.
    *   This effect targets 1 EARTH monster your opponent controls.
    *   If “Enemy Controller” is chained to this effect and your opponent takes control of the “Charmer”, the Flip Effect disappears.
    *   If your opponent takes control of the target with “Mind Control”, control still reverts to you after the effect of “Mind Control” expires (even though it wasn’t your monster originally).
    *   If your opponent takes control of your monster with “Brain Control”, and you activate the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to take it back, you keep control while the “Charmer” is face-up on the field.
    *   If “Book of Moon” is chained to the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to flip the target monster face-down, the effect of the “Charmer” disappears.
    *   If a “Charmer” is removed from play with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, its effect is not re-applied when it’s back on the field.
    *   If “DNA Transplant” changes a monster’s Attribute so that it can be taken by a “Charmer”, and then “DNA Transplant” is destroyed so that the monster’s Attribute no longer corresponds to the effect of the “Charmer”, the controller of the “Charmer” loses control of the monster.
    *   If the turn player controls a “Charmer” and a monster controlled by its effect, and activates “Assault on GHQ” and targets the controlled monster, and the opponent chains an effect to destroy the “Charmer”, the controlled monster returns to the opponent’s control, but is still destroyed by the effect of “Assault on GHQ”.

  
## AUTOMATIC LASER  
> When your opponent Normal or Special Summons a monster(s) with 1000 or more ATK, reveal 1 "Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru" in your hand to activate this card. Destroy that Summoned monster(s).

*   This card activates in the Summon response timing (like "Trap Hole").

## AUTONOMOUS ACTION UNIT  
> Pay 1500 Life Points. Select 1 Monster Card from your opponent's Graveyard. Special Summon it to your side of the field in Attack Position, and equip it with this card. ① When this card is removed from the field, destroy the equipped monster.

*   Paying 1500 Life Points is a cost.
*   This effect targets 1 monster in your opponent Graveyard, it is negated by "Necrovalley".
*   The ① Continuous-like Effect does not start a Chain.
    *   If this card returns to the hand (by "Giant Trunade"), destroy the equipped monster immediately.
    *   If you use "Autonomous Action Unit" to Special Summon a monster from your opponent's Graveyard and then activate "Dimensionhole", "Autonomous Action Unit" is destroyed and when the monster returns to the field it returns to the original owner's control.

  
## AVALANCHING AUSSA  
> ① Once per turn, you can Tribute 1 EARTH monster (except this card) to Special Summon 1 EARTH monster from your hand. The monster Special Summoned by this effect is destroyed if "Avalanching Aussa" is removed from your side of the field.

## AVATAR OF THE POT  
> ① By sending 1 "Pot of Greed" from your hand to the Graveyard, draw 3 cards from your Deck.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Sending "Pot of Greed" to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   If you have your opponent's "Pot of Greed" in your hand because of "Exchange" or "Graverobber", you CAN send your opponent's "Pot of Greed" to the Graveyard to activate your "Avatar of the Pot"'s effect. But if you did this with "Graverobber", you take 2000 points of damage to do so.
    *   You cannot activate "Avatar of the Pot"'s effect while "Banisher of the Light" is in play.

  
## AVENGING KNIGHT PARSHATH  
> ① Once per turn, you can change the battle position of 1 face-up monster your opponent controls. ② During battle between this attacking card and a Defense Position monster whose DEF is lower than the ATK of this card, inflict the difference as Battle Damage to your opponent.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.

You also cannot Tribute one of the monsters Special Summoned by the effect of "Cyber Jar" since the timing has passed.

  
## B.E.S. COVERED CORE  
> ① When this card is Normal Summoned, put 2 counters on it. ② This card cannot be destroyed by battle. ③ If this card attacks or is attacked, at the end of the Damage Step toss a coin and call it. If you call it wrong, remove 1 counter. ④ If this card battles without a counter, destroy it at the end of the Damage Step.

*   The ① Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   If this card's effects are negated, the counters placed by this effect are removed.
*   The ② Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
*   The ③ Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
*   The ④ Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step if this card had no counter on it at the start of the Damage Step.
    *   If “B.E.S. Covered Core” battles a monster, and afterwards you lose the coin toss (for the ③ effect), so that “B.E.S. Covered Core” now has no counters, it is not destroyed. Because it still had a counter during damage calculation.

  
## B.E.S. CRYSTAL CORE  
> ① When this card is Normal Summoned, put 3 counters on it. ② This card cannot be destroyed by battle. ③ If this card attacks or is attacked, remove 1 counter from this card at the end of the Damage Step.

    *   The effect of “B.E.S. Crystal Core” that destroys itself during the damage step cannot be chained to.
*   The ④ Ignition Effect targets, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   If you target the opponent’s monster with the effect of “B.E.S. Crystal Core”, and an effect is chained that causes it to no longer be on your opponent’s side of the field (such as “Remove Brainwashing” or “Enemy Controller”), the effect of “B.E.S. Crystal Core” is not applied.

  
## BACKFIRE  
> When a FIRE monster(s) on your side of the field is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, inflict 500 points of damage to your opponent's Life Points.

*   If a monster is FIRE because it is equipped with "Scroll of Bewitchment", you cannot activate "Backfire"'s effect when it is sent to the Graveyard because it is no longer equipped when it arrives in the Graveyard.
*   When multiple FIRE monsters are sent to the Graveyard simultaneously, the damage is only 500 points.
*   If you control "Backfire" and your opponent's FIRE monster, you can activate "Backfire"'s effect when your opponent's monster that you control is destroyed.

  
## BACKS TO THE WALL

*   You cannot activate this card if your Life Points are exactly 100 or less than 100.
*   You cannot activate this card if there are no “Six Samurai” monsters in your Graveyard.

  
## BACKUP SOLDIER  
> Activate only if there are 5 or more monsters in your Graveyard. Add up to 3 non-Effect Monsters with 1500 or less ATK from your Graveyard to your hand.

*   This effect selects up to 3 targets. You can even target Gemini, Fusion, and Synchro monsters.
*   If you have 4 Effect Monsters and 1 Normal Monster with 1500 ATK in your Graveyard, you can activate this card and return the 1 Normal Monster to your hand.
*   If you have 5 Normal Monsters in your Graveyard, you can activate "Backup Soldier" and chain a second "Backup Soldier" before the first resolves, because the 5 monster requirement only needs to be fulfilled at activation. This would allow you to put all 5 monsters in your hand, 3 with the first "Backup Soldier" and 2 with the second.
*   If your opponent activates "Delinquent Duo" and you chain "Backup Soldier" with 2 pieces of Exodia and retrieve the other 3 from your Graveyard you win the Duel before you have to discard for "Delinquent Duo". This is because you check for victory conditions in between steps in a chain, (but not in between two separate effects of a single card like "Graceful Charity").

  
## BAD REACTION TO SIMOCHI  
> As long as this card remains face-up on the field, any effect of increasing your opponent's Life Points is changed to inflict the same amount of points in damage to your opponent's Life Points.

*   The Continuous-like Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field. It does not activate.
*   This effect is not cumulative. If you control 2 copies of "Bad Reaction to Simochi" and your opponent activates "Dian Keto the Cure Master", they only take 1000 points of damage \[[REF](http://web.archive.org/web/20080131140306/http:/entertainment.upperdeck.com/COMMUNITY/forums/thread/1005905.aspx)\].
*   VS. "Prime Material Dragon": if both "Bad Reaction to Simochi" and "Prime Material Dragon" are on the field when Player A's "Upstart Goblin" resolves, Player B will gain 1000 Life Points (gains / damage happen normally) \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=808154)\].
    *   These rules apply similarly to "Nurse Reficule the Fallen One" (erratum: Darklord Nurse Reficule).
*   If you control this card on the field and activate "Rain of Mercy" (which makes both players gain 1000 LP): you gain 1000 Life Points and your opponent takes 1000 points of damage.

  
## BAIT DOLL  
> Force the activation of 1 face-down Trap Card. If the timing of the activation of the Trap Card is incorrect, negate the effect and destroy it. If it is not a Trap Card, it is returned to its original position. After this card is activated, it is placed into the Deck (not the Graveyard). Then shuffle the Deck.

*   You cannot activate this card if you cannot return cards to the Deck (by "G.B. Hunter").
*   As long as the activation and effect of "Bait Doll" are not negated, the effect of "Bait Doll" that shuffles it back into the Deck still resolves.
*   This effect targets 1 Set Spell / Trap card on the field.
    *   The target can be chained if its activation requirement is met.
    *   The target cannot be chained if it was just Set this turn (by "Dust Tornado").
    *   If this card activates a Trap Card with a cost, and that Trap Card's activation timing is correct, its owner must pay all possible costs. If they cannot pay the costs, the Trap Card is negated and destroyed.
    *   If "Bait Doll" targets a Set "Royal Oppression", the opponent can chain the "Royal Oppression" which will negate the effect of "Bait Doll" (it will not return to your Deck), or the opponent can allow "Bait Doll" to force the activation of "Royal Oppression", and "Bait Doll" will then be shuffled into the Deck and "Royal Oppression" will remain active since its activation timing was legitimate.
*   If "Jinzo" is face-up on the field and the effect of "Bait Doll" forces the activation of a Normal or Counter Trap Card, that Trap Card’s effect is negated and the Trap Card is destroyed. If a Continuous Trap Card is forced to activate by the effect of "Bait Doll" it will remain face-up on the field meaninglessly until "Jinzo" is destroyed.
*   If "Chain Burst" is active on the field and you use "Bait Doll" to activate the opponent's Trap Card, and its timing is correct, the opponent takes the 1000 points of damage.
*   When "Bait Doll" is activated, "Fake Trap" cannot be activated because there is no guarantee that "Bait Doll" will destroy a Trap Card.

  
## BALLISTA OF RAMPART SMASHING  
> If the equipped monster attacks a face-down Defense Position monster, it gains 1500 ATK during damage calculation only.

*   This Continuous-like Effect increases the ATK in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.
*   "Ballista of Rampart Smashing" only increases the ATK for damage calculation, then the increase disappears after the end of damage calculation.

  
## BALLOON LIZARD  
> ① Put 1 counter on this card during each of your Standby Phases. ② When this card is destroyed, inflict damage to the controller of the card that destroyed it equal to the number of counters x 400 points.

*   The ① Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field.
    *   While "Skill Drain" is active, you can't put new counters on "Balloon Lizard".
    *   The counters on "Balloon Lizard" are NOT Spell Counters.
    *   Remove all counters on "Balloon Lizard" if it is flipped face-down or removed from the field.
*   The ② Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves in the Graveyard (or banished).
    *   If this card is destroyed by battle, this effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   You can use "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Balloon Lizard"'s effect.

  
## BAMBOO SCRAP  
> Tribute 1 Plant-Type monster. Special Summon 2 "Plant Tokens" (Plant-Type/EARTH/Level 1/ATK 800/DEF 500) to your opponent's side of the field in Defense Position.

*   Tributing 1 Plant-Type monster is a cost to activate this card.
*   You can Tribute a face-down Plant-Type monster to activate this card.

  
## BANISHER OF THE LIGHT  
> ① As long as this card remains face-up on the field, any card sent to the Graveyard is removed from play.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   If "Banisher of the Light" is destroyed, it will be sent to the Graveyard. If "Banisher of the Light" and other monsters are destroyed simultaneously all monsters are sent to the Graveyard.
    *   If "Don Zaloog" battles an Attack Position "Banisher of the Light", Banisher is marked as destroyed at the end of Substep 4 - Damage Calculation, but its Continuous Effect still applies, so any card sent to the Graveyard in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation (by "Don Zaloog") will be banished. Finally, in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step, "Banisher of the Light" is sent to the Graveyard.
    *   "Kuriboh" and "Thunder Dragon" can be discarded from your hand and activated while "Banisher of the Light" is on the field.

  
## BANNER OF COURAGE  
> ① During your Battle Phase, all monsters you control gain 200 ATK.

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not start a Chain.
*   Multiple copies of this card are cumulative.

  
## BARK OF DARK RULER  
> You can only activate this card during the Damage Step of a Battle Phase if a Fiend-Type monster on your side of the field battles. Pay Life Points (in multiples of 100 points) to decrease 1 of your opponent's monster's ATK and DEF by the same amount of points until End Phase of that turn.

*   This card targets your opponent’s monster that is battling your Fiend-Type monster.
*   Paying Life Points for this card is a cost.
*   You cannot pay more Life Points than necessary. This means that if the target monster has ATK 1500 / DEF 1800, the highest amount of Life Points you can pay is 1800. The target monster will then be an ATK 0 / DEF 0. If the target monster has ATK 1850 / DEF 500, the most you can pay is 1800. This is because you have to play in multiples of 100, and paying 1900 would be paying more than necessary. So you may pay 1800 Life Points and the target monster would become an ATK 50 / DEF 0.

  
## BARREL BEHIND THE DOOR  
> Activate only when a card's effect that would inflict damage to you is activated. Your opponent takes the damage instead.

*   This card can only be Chained to an activated effect that inflicts damage to YOUR Life Points.
    *   You can activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Jigen Bakudan". You don’t activate "Barrel Behind the Door" when the Flip Effect activates, you activate "Barrel Behind the Door" when "Jigen Bakudan" activates its effect during the next Standby Phase to inflict damage.
    *   You can activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Ring of Destruction", and then your opponent will take all of the damage (the damage inflicted to him and the damage that would have been inflicted to you). The same is true for "Tremendous Fire".
    *   You can activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Magic Cylinder". The attack will be negated and the damage transferred to the opponent.
*   VS. "Ceasefire": You can't activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Ceasefire" if all monsters on the field are face-down, or if all monsters on the field are face-up Normal Monsters, but you can activate it against "Ceasefire" if there is at least 1 face-up Effect Monster on the field.
*   VS: "Bad Reaction to Simochi": If "Bad Reaction to Simochi" is active, you can activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against effects that would normally cause a Life Point increase, because they inflict damage instead.
*   This card can't be Chained to Life Point costs (ex: "Wall of Revealing Light"), to effects that make you lose Life Points (ex: "The Immortal of Thunder"), to effects that switch damage (like another "Barrel Behind the Door") because they do not inflict damage, they simply transfer it, to cards that do not inflict damage when the card resolves (ex: "Graverobber"), nor to effects that aren't guaranteed to inflict Effect Damage (ex: "Time Wizard", "Ante").
*   This card can't be Chained to a Continuous Spell / Trap Card, an Equip Spell Card, or a Field Spell Card.
    *   Example: "Magical Thorn", "Dark Snake Syndrome", "Wave-Motion Cannon", or "Black Pendant".
*   This card can't be Chained to Continuous Effects (ex: "Fire Princess") since they don't activate.

  
## BARRIER STATUE OF THE ABYSS  
> ① Neither player can Special Summon monsters, except DARK monsters.

*   Non-DARK Monsters can't be Special Summoned face-down.
*   "Reasoning" can be activated while a Barrier Statue is face-up. If "Reasoning" would Special Summon a non-DARK monster, it is sent to the Graveyard and the effect of "Reasoning" ends.
*   "Future Fusion" CAN'T be activated UNLESS a DARK Fusion Monster is revealed.
*   The "Shallow Grave" CAN'T be activated unless BOTH PLAYERS have 1(+) DARK monster in their GY.
*   "Magical Hats" CAN'T be activated while a Barrier Statue is in play.

  
## BARRIER STATUE OF THE DROUGHT  
> ① Neither player can Special Summon monsters, except EARTH monsters.

*   Non-EARTH Monsters can't be Special Summoned face-down.

*   The "Shallow Grave" CAN'T be activated unless BOTH PLAYERS have 1(+) EARTH monster in their GY.

> ① Neither player can Special Summon monsters, except FIRE monsters.

*   Non-FIRE Monsters can't be Special Summoned face-down.
*   "Reasoning" can be activated while a Barrier Statue is face-up. If "Reasoning" would Special Summon a non-FIRE monster, it is sent to the Graveyard and the effect of "Reasoning" ends.

> ① Neither player can Special Summon monsters, except WIND monsters.

*   Non-WIND Monsters can't be Special Summoned face-down.
*   "Reasoning" can be activated while a Barrier Statue is face-up. If "Reasoning" would Special Summon a non-WIND monster, it is sent to the Graveyard and the effect of "Reasoning" ends.

*   The "Shallow Grave" CAN'T be activated unless BOTH PLAYERS have 1(+) WATER monster in their GY.

## BATTERY CHARGER

*   You cannot activate "Batteryman Charger"'s effect if you do not have any eligble "Batteryman" monsters remaining in your hand or Deck.

  
## BATTERYMAN C

*   If you have 2 “Batterymen C” on the field in Attack Position, each of your Machines gains +1000 ATK. If you have 3 “Battermen C” on the field in Attack Position, each of your Machines gains +1500 ATK. (NOT +4500!!!)
*   A “Batteryman C” equipped to “Relinquished” is not in Attack or Defense Position so it will not be counted for the effect of “Batteryman C”.
*   If “Batteryman C” is changed to Machine-Type, it will itself gain the ATK bonus.

  
## BATTERYMAN INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH

*   Removing 1 Thunder-Type monster from play is a cost to activate this effect.
*   "Batteryman Industrial Strength"'s effect cannot be activated unless there is at least 1 monster and at least 1 Spell or Trap Card on the field.
*   If an effect is chained that removes one of the targets from the field, the remaining target is destroyed.

  
## BATTERYMAN MICRO-CELL

*   If "Batteryman Micro-Cell" is flipped face-up with "Ceasefire", etc., you will still draw 1 card when it is destroyed in battle and sent to the Graveyard.

  
## BATTLE FADER  
> ① When your opponent’s monster declares a direct attack, you can Special Summon this card from your hand and end the Battle Phase. Ⓒ If this card is Special Summoned with this effect, remove it from play when it is removed from the field.

*   The ① Trigger Effect activates during the first substep of the Battle Step - Attack Declaration.
    *   This effect to Special Summon can be negated by "Royal Oppression".
    *   The Special Summon and ending the Battle Phase are all part of the effect which activates and resolves in the hand. This effect is not negated by "Skill Drain".
    *   You cannot activate multiple copies of "Battle Fader" in response to a single attack declaration.
    *   This effect has the same timing as cards like "Mirror Force".
        *   Example: Player A declares a direct attack with "Light and Darkness Dragon" while Player B has a set "Mirror Force" and a "Battle Fader" in hand. Player B activates "Battle Fader’s" effect as Chain Link 1. Player A activates "Light and Darkness Dragon’s" mandatory Trigger Effect as Chain Link 2. Player B then activates "Mirror Force" as Chain Link 3.
    *   This effect ends the Battle Step and moves players into the End Step of the Battle Phase \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=804828)\].
        *   "Gladiator Beasts" that have already battled (participated in Damage Calculation) can still activate their effects during the End of the Battle Phase.
*   The Ⓒ Condition disappears when "Battle Fader" is flipped face-down.
    *   If a card effect would remove this card from the field, it is banished by this Condition instead.
    *   If this card is targeted by "Caius the Shadow Monarch"'s effect, no Effect Damage is inflicted \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=854459)\].

  
## BATTLE MANIA

*   You cannot activate this card if your opponent controls no monsters.
*   If your opponent controls a face-up Attack Position monster at the end of their Main Phase 1, they must conduct their Battle Phase during the turn “Battle Mania” is activated.
*   Monsters unaffected by Trap Cards, like “Elemental Hero Wildheart”, do not have to attack during the turn “Battle Mania” is activated.
*   During the Battle Phase of a turn in which “Battle Mania” was activated, if your “Ultimate Tyranno” attacks, but the attack is negated, it must still attack again if there is another monster in play. (It cannot attack the same target twice.)

  
## BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS

*   “Battle of the Elements” can only be activated if there is at least 1 face-up monster on both sides of the field.

  
## BATTLE TELEPORTATION

*   This effect targets your face-up Psychic-Type monster.
*   You can activate “Battle Teleportation” even if your opponent has no open Monster Card Zones. If you do, the Psychic-Type monster is unable to move to your opponent’s side of the field and is destroyed.
*   You cannot activate “Battle Teleportation” if you cannot enter your Battle Phase.
*   You can activate “Battle Teleportation” if your opponent has “Swords of Revealing Light” face-up on the field because “Swords of Revealing Light” only prevents you from declaring an attack.
*   This card can target a monster that has already attacked.
*   You can activate “Battle Teleportation” any time between your Draw Phase and the end of the Battle Phase.

  
## BATTLE TUNED

*   "Battle Tuned" targets 1 Tuner monster in your Graveyard.

  
## BATTLE TUTORS (Mystic Tomato, Shining Angel, UFO Turtle, Mother Grizzly, Flying Kaminari #1, Giant Rat, Pyramid Turtle, etc)  
> When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, you can Special Summon 1 \[Attribute or Type\] monster with \[specified ATK / specified DEF / specified Level\] in \[Battle Position\].

*   These optional Trigger Effects activate in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
*   The "When... you can" structure means this effect can miss the timing.
*   Because this effect activates / resolves in the Damage Step, it cannot be negated by"Royal Oppression". Additionally, "Torrential Tribute" cannot be activated in response to the Summon.
*   These effects do not activate if the monster is removed from play (by "Dimensional Fissure").
*   These effects do not activate if the monster is destroyed by a card effect (ex: "Red Dragon Archfiend").

  
## BATTLE-SCARRED

*   If the Archfiend targeted by "Battle-Scarred" is flipped face-down, then the effect of "Battle-Scarred" disappears and "Battle-Scarred" remains on the field meaninglessly.
*   You can select an Archfiend that doesn't require you to pay Life Points as a target for "Battle-Scarred" (such as "Summoned Skull", "Archfiend Soldier", or "Fiend Skull Dragon").
*   When your opponent takes control of your Archfiend targeted by "Battle-Scarred", then your opponent must pay the cost for the Archfiend, and then pay the cost again because of "Battle-Scarred".
*   When an Archfiend is equipped with "Heart of Clear Water", it is not destroyed if it was targeted by "Battle-Scarred" and "Battle-Scarred" is removed from the field.
*   If your opponent doesn't have enough Life Points to pay for "Battle-Scarred", nothing happens to your opponent, you must still pay for the cost of your Archfiend, and "Battle-Scarred" remains on the field.
*   If "Battle-Scarred" and "Pandemonium" are both active, neither player has to pay for Archfiend costs or for "Battle-Scarred".

  
## BAZOO THE SOUL-EATER

*   If you remove Monster Cards from your Graveyard to increase the ATK of "Bazoo the Soul-Eater", then on your opponent’s turn he uses "Change of Heart" to gain control of the same "Bazoo the Soul-Eater", your opponent can remove cards from his Graveyard to further increase the ATK. The ATK increase you caused will end during that End Phase, and the ATK increase your opponent caused will end during your End Phase.
*   Removing Monster Cards from the Graveyard is a cost of "Bazoo the Soul-Eater"’s effect, so if your opponent chains to the activation of this effect with "Call of the Haunted", to Special Summon "Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer", the effect of "Bazoo the Soul-Eater" is not negated since the Monster Cards were already removed.

  
## BEAST KING BARBAROS UR

*   You can Normal Summon this card.
*   If you equip “Fairy Meteor Crush” to your “Beast Machine King Barbaros Ür” and attack a Defense Position monster with lower DEF than this card’s ATK, your opponent will not take Battle Damage.

  
## BEAST OF THE PHARAOH

*   "Beast of the Pharaoh"'s effect targets 1 Level 4 or lower Zombie-Type monster in your Graveyard.

  
## BEAST SOUL SWAP

*   The Beast-Type monster is Special Summoned from your hand.
*   You can Special Summon the same Beast-Type monster you returned to your hand with the same effect of "Beast Soul Swap".
*   You can use "Beast Soul Swap" to return a non-Beast-Type monster on the field that has been changed to Beast-Type with "DNA Surgery".
*   This card targets the 1 face-up Beast-Type monster you returned to the hand.

  
## BEASTKING OF THE SWAMPS  
> ① You can substitute this card for any 1 Fusion-Material Monster. When you do this, the other Fusion-Material Monster(s) must be the correct one(s).

*   The ① effect does not have any classification. It is not an Ignition, Trigger, Quick, or Continuous Effect.
    *   This effect does not target.
    *   Using "King of the Swamp" as a Fusion Material does not start a Chain Link.
    *   The effect "You can substitute this card for any 1 Fusion Material monster." of a monster like "King of the Swamp" is not applied while the monster is banished. If you activate "Parallel World Fusion", then you cannot use it as a substitute for a Fusion Material.
    *   The effect "You can substitute this card for any 1 Fusion Material Monster" of a monster like "King of the Swamp" or "Goddess with the Third Eye" is not applied while the monster is in the Deck.
    *   When Special Summoning "Chimeratech Fortress Dragon" or "XYZ-Dragon Cannon", you cannot send to the Graveyard a monster like "The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion" as a substitute for a Fusion Material.
    *   If "King of the Swamp" is selected for the effect of "Prohibition", you cannot use either of its effects.

  
## BECKONING LIGHT  
> Discard all the cards in your hand, then select a number of LIGHT monsters in your Graveyard equal to the number of cards you discarded, and add them to your hand.

*   Discarding is not a cost.
*   "Beckoning Light" doesn't target. When you resolve "Beckoning Light", first discard, then pick cards to add to your hand. So you can add cards to your hand that you discarded while resolving "Beckoning Light".
*   You CANNOT activate "Beckoning Light" if you have no cards in your hand.
*   You CANNOT activate "Beckoning Light" if there are fewer LIGHT monsters in your Graveyard than there are cards in your hand, even if 1 or more of the cards in your hand are LIGHT monsters.
*   You can activate "Beckoning Light" while "Macro Cosmos" is active, but since no cards will be discarded to the Graveyard, you CANNOT add any LIGHT monsters from your Graveyard to your hand \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=982726)\].
*   If "Disappear" is chained, and there are now fewer LIGHT monsters in your Graveyard than cards in your hand, "Beckoning Light" resolves without effect (you don't discard your hand or add cards to your hand).

  
## BEGONE, KNAVE!

*   If "Gemini Elf" attacks a Defense Position "Battle Footballer", and "Gemini Elf"'s controller takes 200 damage, then "Begone, Knave!"'s effect will send "Battle Footballer" back to its owner's hand.
*   The effect of "Begone, Knave!" can be on a chain.
*   The effect of "Begone, Knave!" is applied to the monster that inflicts Battle Damage to the player, so if "Amazoness Swords Woman" battles a stronger monster, "Amazoness Swords Woman" would normally be returned to the owner's hand, but because she is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, she will not be returned.

  
## BEHEMOTH THE KING OF ALL ANIMALS

*   It is possible to "properly" Tribute Summon "Behemoth the King of All Animals" with just 1 Tribute. For example, you can Tribute Summon it with "Trojan Horse", or use "Cost Down" and then Tribute 1 monster because "Behemoth the King of All Animals" is only Level 5. In cases such as this, either 2000 ATK or 2700 ATK is correct, so the controller can select which ATK it will have.
*   If "Trojan Horse" is Tributed to Tribute Summon "Behemoth the King of All Animals", you still only return 1 monster from the Graveyard to your hand, because it’s the same number as the number of monsters you Tributed to perform the Summon.
*   If "Behemoth the King of All Animals" is Tribute Summoned with 2000 ATK, and is then flipped face-down or removed from play temporarily, its ATK becomes 2700 points when it is again face-up on the field.
*   If you Tribute Summon "Behemoth the King of All Animals" with 1 Tribute, and "Skill Drain" is activated, its ATK becomes 2700 points. Even if "Skill Drain" is destroyed, the ATK remains at 2700 points.
*   If you Tribute Set "Behemoth the King of All Animals" with 1 Tribute, its ATK will only be 2000 points when flipped face-up. However, once it is face-up, if it is flipped face-down again, the effect is reset and its ATK becomes 2700 points.
*   The second effect of "Behemoth the King of All Animals" is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to. It is a targeting effect that targets a monster(s) in the Graveyard.
*   If you Tribute Summon this card with 1 Tribute and equip it with "Megamorph", its current ATK will become 4000 or 1000, depending on Life Points.

  
## BELIAL - MARQUIS OF DARKNESS  
> ① Your opponent cannot select any monster you control, except "Belial - Marquis of Darkness", as an attack target, or as a target of a Spell or Trap Card.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies so long as "Belial - Marquis of Darkness" is face-up on the field.
    *   If a Spell / Trap Card targets 1 monster you control and you chain "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Belial - Marquis of Darkness", the effect is still resolved as normal.
    *   Monsters in your Graveyard can still be targeted by your opponent's Spell / Trap Cards.
    *   This effect does not apply to face-down monsters you control \[REF needed, errata'd in 2011\].
*   While the ① Continuous Effect applies, your opponent can:
    *   use Spell / Trap Cards which do not target (ex: "Bottomless Trap Hole", "Smashing Ground");
    *   target your other monsters with monster effects (ex: "Caius the Shadow Monarch");
    *   target your face-down Defense Position monsters with Spell / Trap Cards & Effects \[REF needed, errata'd in 2011\];
    *   attack your face-down Defense Position monsters \[REF needed, errata'd in 2011\].
*   If you control "Evil HERO Malicious Fiend" & "Belial - Marquis of Darkness", and their effects are active, your opponent's monsters are changed to Attack Position and must attack "Evil HERO Malicious Fiend".

  
## BENDING DESTINY

*   This card does not target. You can activate it during the Damage Step. Returning the removed from play card to the hand does not start a Chain.

  
## BERFOMET

*   If “Berfomet” is not face-up on the field when its effect resolves, you still add “Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts” to your hand.

  
## BERSERK DRAGON

*   "Berserk Dragon" cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, and cannot be Special Summoned EXCEPT by the effect of "A Deal with Dark Ruler". So "Berserk Dragon" cannot be Special Summoned with "Monster Reborn", etc., even if Special Summoned properly first.
*   If "Berserk Dragon" is removed from play with "Interdimension Matter Transporter", you cannot try to resolve "Berserk Dragon"'s effect before it returns to play; you must return it to play first and then it loses 500 ATK.
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, "Berserk Dragon"'s effects are negated. But "Berserk Dragon"'s effect doesn't count turns, so if "Skill Drain" was active for 4 turns, and is then destroyed, do not reduce "Berserk Dragon"'s ATK for those 4 turns.

  
## BERSERK GORILLA

*   If a face-down "Berserk Gorilla" is attacked and flipped face-up, it's destroyed after damage calculation.
*   If a face-down "Berserk Gorilla" is flipped face-up by "Swords of Revealing Light", it's destroyed after resolving "Swords of Revealing Light".
*   "Berserk Gorilla" cannot attack if "Swords of Revealing Light", multiple "Marauding Captains", etc. are in play.
*   If "Stumbling" and "Final Attack Orders" are both in play, and "Berserk Gorilla" is Summoned, "Berserk Gorilla" is destroyed when it is changed to Defense Position by "Stumbling".
*   If "Final Attack Orders" and "Berserk Gorilla" are both on the field, and the opponent targets "Berserk Gorilla" with "Ring of Destruction", and you chain "Zero Gravity", "Berserk Gorilla" is destroyed in the middle of the chain due to "Zero Gravity"'s effect, and "Ring of Destruction"'s effect disappears.
*   If you control "Berserk Gorilla" and another monster, "Berserk Gorilla" doesn't have to be the first monster you attack with, you can attack with other monsters first, as long as you do attack with "Berserk Gorilla".
*   If "The Dark Door" is active and you control "Berserk Gorilla" and another monster, you can choose for your other monster to be the 1 monster that attacks.
*   If you control “Berserk Gorilla” you must enter your Battle Phase, even if “Gravity Bind” is active on the field, preventing it from attacking.

  
## BIG BANG SHOT

*   When the monster equipped with "Big Bang Shot" is destroyed, and "Big Bang Shot" is destroyed as a result of this, the equipped monster is not removed from play.
*   The effect of "Big Bang Shot" that removes the equipped monster from play can be resolved between steps of a chain. For example, if "Change of Heart" targets a monster equipped with "Big Bang Shot", and "Mystical Space Typhoon" is chained to "Change of Heart" to destroy "Big Bang Shot", first resolve "Mystical Space Typhoon" and destroy "Big Bang Shot", then remove the monster that was equipped from play, and THEN resolve "Change of Heart" (and the effect of "Change of Heart" disappears).
*   If a monster equipped with "Big Bang Shot" is flipped face-down, it is no longer a target of "Big Bang Shot" so "Big Bang Shot" is sent to the Graveyard and the monster is not removed from play.
*   When "Imperial Order" is active, and you destroy "Big Bang Shot" with "Dust Tornado", the effect of "Big Bang Shot" that would remove the monster from play is NOT applied.
*   When you send "Big Bang Shot" to the Graveyard with "Emergency Provisions", the monster is removed from play at the same time.
*   When equipped to "Guardian Ceal", if you send "Big Bang Shot" to the Graveyard as a cost for "Guardian Ceal"'s effect, "Guardian Ceal" is removed from play but "Guardian Ceal"'s effect still resolves.
*   If a monster is equipped with "Big Bang Shot" and "Fiber Jar" is activated, both "Big Bang Shot" and the equipped monster are shuffled into the Deck, and the equipped monster is not removed from play even though "Big Bang Shot" was removed from the field.
*   If you equip your "Big Bang Shot" to your opponent's "Dark Magician", and "Dark Magician" attacks your "Giant Soldier of Stone", the opponent of the owner of the "Big Bang Shot" takes the damage (so your opponent, who attacked with "Dark Magician", takes 900 points of damage.)
*   The battle damage caused when the equipped monster attacks a Defense Position monster is considered to come from the equipped monster, not from "Big Bang Shot". So a "Don Zaloog" equipped with "Big Bang Shot" could still make the opponent discard 1 card when attacking a face-down monster with low DEF.
*   If you Special Summon a monster with "Premature Burial", and equip it with "Big Bang Shot", and "Heavy Storm" is activated, the effects of "Premature Burial" and "Big Bang Shot" form a chain, with the controller of the 2 cards determining the order in which they are placed on the chain, and the order in which they are resolved. If the controller chooses "Big Bang Shot" to be Step 2, then the monster will be removed from play. If the controller chooses "Premature Burial" to be Step 2, then the monster will be destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.

  
## BIG BURN

*   You can only activate "Big Burn" when an EFFECT that removes monsters in the Graveyard is activated. So you can't activate "Big Burn" when a player removes monsters in the Graveyard as a COST to Special Summon "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning", "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End", or to activate the effect of "Strike Ninja" or "Freed the Brave Wanderer". Nor can you use "Big Burn" when monsters are removed for a condition.
*   "Big Burn"'s effect is negated if "Necrovalley" is active.
*   You can chain "Big Burn" to effects like "Disappear", "The Shallow Grave", or "Spear Cretin".
*   You can't activate "Big Burn" when "Sinister Serpent" activates in the Graveyard, because "Sinister Serpent" doesn't target.
*   When "Spirit Elimination" is activated and "Big Burn" is chained, the player who activated "Spirit Elimination" removes all monsters on his side of the field. The other player removes all monsters in the Graveyard as usual.

  
## BIG SHIELD GARDNA

*   A face-down "Big Shield Gardna" can only negate a Spell Card that targets 1 face-down monster, so it cannot negate "Riryoku", "Creature Swap" or "Dark Hole", but could negate "Nobleman of Crossout" or "Tribute to the Doomed".
*   If "Big Shield Gardna" is targeted with a Spell Card, you may chain "Book of Moon" to flip it face-down, then it can negate the Spell Card and will flip back to face-up Defense Position.
*   "Skill Drain" only negates the effects of monsters that are face-up on the field, so a face-down "Big Shield Gardna" may still negate a Spell Card that targets it while "Skill Drain" is active on the field. It will still be flipped to face-up Defense Position, and now its effect that changes its battle position when it is attacked will be negated.
*   If "Prickle Fairy" attacks a face-down "Big Shield Gardna" both their effects will occur at the end of the Damage Step. "Prickle Fairy" will be Step 1 and "Big Shield Gardna" Step 2. So it will change to Attack Position, and then the effect of "Prickle Fairy" will change it back to Defense Position.

  
## BIG WAVE SMALL WAVE

*   You can Special Summon high-level WATER monsters with "Big Wave Small Wave", like "Levia-Dragon - Daedalus", "Suijin", or "Gogiga Gagagigo".
*   You cannot use "Big Wave Small Wave" to Summon "Special Summon-only" WATER monsters like "Aqua Spirit" or "Fenrir".
*   You cannot activate "Big Wave Small Wave" when there are no WATER monsters on your side of the field.
*   "The Legendary Fisherman" is not destroyed by the effect of "Big Wave Small Wave" if "Umi" is on the field, so he remains on the field.
*   After destroying WATER monsters with "Big Wave Small Wave" you can choose not to Special Summon any WATER monsters if you wish.

  
## BIG-TUSKED MAMMOTH

*   The effect of “Big-Tusked Mammoth” includes those monsters Summoned this turn before “Big-Tusked Mammoth” was face-up on the field. For example, if your opponent attacks with a monster that was Summoned this turn, and you activate “Call of the Haunted” to Special Summon “Big-Tusked Mammoth” from the Graveyard, this causes a replay, and your opponent now cannot attack with the monster that was Summoned this turn.
*   If “Big-Tusked Mammoth” is Set on the field, and is attacked by a monster that was Summoned this turn, the attack resolves normally.
*   Monsters flipped face-up with an effect like “Book of Taiyou” are not affected by “Big-Tusked Mammoth” and can attack that turn.
*   If “Big-Tusked Mammoth” is on the field, and a monster that was Summoned this turn is removed from play temporarily and returns to the field the same turn, it still cannot attack.

  
## BLACK BRUTDRAGO  
> 1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner Gemini monsters  
① Once per turn, you can send 1 Gemini monster from your hand to the Graveyard to select and destroy 1 Spell or Trap Card your opponent controls. ② When this card is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, you can select 1 Gemini monster in your Graveyard and Special Summon it. The Special Summoned Gemini monster is treated as an Effect Monster, and gains its effect._

*   If you use "[Eccentric Boy](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/EccentricBoy)" to Synchro Summon "Black Brutdrago", you must send a Gemini monster from your hand to the Graveyard as a Synchro Material Monster.
*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Sending 1 Gemini monster from your hand to the Graveyard is a cost. This effect cannot be activated while "Dimensional Fissure" is active.
    *   This effect targets 1 Spell / Trap Card (face-up / face-down) your opponent controls.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect targets 1 Gemini monster in your Graveyard.
    *   This effect will can activate even during the Damage Step.

  
## BLACK GARDEN  
> ① When a monster is Normal or Special Summoned, except by the effect of “Black Garden”, halve its ATK and Special Summon 1 “Rose Token” (Plant-Type/DARK/Level 2/ATK 800/DEF 800) to its controller’s opponent’s side of the field, in Attack Position. ② You can destroy this card and all face-up Plant-Type monsters on the field and Special Summon 1 monster with ATK equal to the total ATK of those monsters from your Graveyard.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger-like Effect CANNOT miss the timing.
    *   Player A performs a Normal Summon, causing "Black Garden" to activate. Player A chooses which Zone the "Rose Token" is Summoned to, and is considered its _owner_ (for "Remove Brainwashing").
    *   This effect activates in response to Normal and Special Summons (including when a monster is Special Summoned face-down), not Flip Summons.
    *   This effect activates even if the Summmoned monster is unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards, its ATK will not be halved, but a "Rose Token" is still Special Summoned.
    *   This effect activates even if a player cannot Special Summon a "Rose Token" (by "Vanity's Fiend" or while their opponent's Monster Card Zones are full), halving the ATK of the Summoned monster(s).
    *   This effect activates once when multiple monsters are Special Summoned simultaneously. It will halve the ATK of each of those monsters and Summon a single "Rose Token".
        *   "The Shallow Grave" causes both players to Special Summon a monster(s) simultaneously, and thus each player will also Special Summon 1 "Rose Token".
    *   This effect activates multiple times if multiple monsters are Normal / Special Summoned sequentially in a chain (ex: "Ultimate Offering"). It will halve the ATK of each of those monsters and Summon 1 "Rose Token".
    *   The ATK change applies while that monster is face-up, even if "Black Garden" leaves the field.
    *   An affected monster equipped with "Megamorph": its ATK will be double its original ATK.
    *   If a monster with "? ATK" (ex: "Tragoedia") is Normal / Special Summoned: first determine its original ATK, then halve it by "Black Garden"'s effect. That monster's ATK will not change.
    *   If "Black Garden" and "The Wicked Dreadroot" are face-up on the field: when a monster is Normal or Special Summoned, its ATK is first halved by "The Wicked Dreadroot", and halved again afterwards when "Black Garden"'s effect resolves.
*   VS. "Torrential Tribute": If chained to the effect of "Black Garden", no "Rose Token" will be Summoned because the Normal / Special Summoned monster cannot have its ATK halved \[[REF1](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Forum:Black_Garden_vs._torrential/bottomless), [REF2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=659951)\].
*   VS. "Summon Limit": Player A Normal Summons a monster while Player B controls "Black Garden" and "Summon Limit". The "Rose Token" is considered Summoned by Player B's card effect, so Player A can Summon one more time that turn \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=635623)\].
*   VS. "Scapegoat": Player A controls "Black Garden" and activates "Scapegoat". The effect of "Black Garden" activates after the "Sheep Tokens" are Special Summoned, no "Rose Token" is Summoned since Player A cannot Special Summon. If Player A activates "Scapegoat" while Player B controls "Black Garden", "Black Garden" activates and Special Summons a "Rose Token" after "Scapegoat" resolves.
*   The ② Ignition-like Effect targets a monster in the Graveyard at activation.
    *   You CANNOT activate this effect while there are no Plant-Type monsters on the field.
    *   You CANNOT activate this effect while "Black Garden" cannot be destroyed (ex: "Field Barrier").
    *   This effect can target a monster with 0 ATK so long as the total ATK of all Plant-Type monsters on the field (minimum 1) is also zero \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=709167)\].
    *   "Black Garden" AND all face-up Plant-Type monsters are destroyed at resolution. This is not a cost.
    *   This effect resolves sequentially. "Black Garden" AND 1(+) Plant-Type monster(s) must be destroyed by this effect to Summon the target.
    *   If "Black Garden" is destroyed before resolving this effect, no Plant-Type monsters are destroyed and the target remains in the Graveyard.
    *   If the total ATK of all Plant-Type monsters (+ ATK modifiers) is not the same as the ATK of the target, the target is not Summoned (you still destroy "Black Garden" and all Plant-Type monsters).
*   "Royal Oppression" CANNOT be activated when "Black Garden" is activated (played face-up).
    *   "Royal Oppression" (and its effect) can chain to either of "Black Garden"'s effects.

  
## BLACK HORN OF HEAVEN

*   Like “Horn of Heaven”, this card cannot be used against “Premature Burial”, etc. It can be used against inherent Special Summon effects like “Cyber Dragon” or “Dark Necrofear”.
*   You cannot activate “Black Horn of Heaven” when you Special Summon “Lava Golem” onto your opponent’s side of the field.

  
## BLACK LUSTER SOLDIER - ENVOY OF THE BEGINNING

*   "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" is treated as a different card from "Black Luster Soldier". So you can have 3 copies of "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" and 3 copies of "Black Luster Soldier" in your Deck & Side Deck combined.
*   "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" can remove itself from play using its first effect.
*   The first effect of "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" can be activated during your Main Phase 1 or 2. The second effect can be activated during your Damage Step in your Battle Phase, and can be chained to.
*   If you activate "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning"'s first effect, and "Skill Drain" is chained to it to negate the effect, or if "Skill Drain" was active before you activated the effect, you cannot attack with "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" that turn because the activation of the effect was not negated and the condition that is included will not be negated by "Skill Drain".
*   If you use the first effect of "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning", then remove him from play and return him to play, or destroy him and Special Summon him again, or flip him face-down then face-up again, you can activate his effect again that same turn.
*   If "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" attacks, and its attack is negated by "Magic Cylinder" or "Negate Attack", you cannot activate his first effect during Main Phase 2.
*   When a card is removed from play by "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning"'s first effect, it is removed from play face-up.
*   If "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" destroys your opponent's only monster with his first attack, he can attack your opponent directly for the second attack.
*   If "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" attacks and destroys your opponent's monster, then attacks a second time and destroys another monster, it does not get to attack any more that turn.
*   Even if you equip him with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce", "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" only gets a maximum of 2 attacks.
*   When "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" conducts a second attack using his second effect, his effect activates during the first attack's Damage Step, and the attack is declared in the next Battle Step. The second attack must come consecutively after the first attack; other monsters' attacks cannot come in-between.

  
## BLACK PENDANT

*   If this card is destroyed while face-down, it still does damage to your opponent.
*   If this card’s activation is negated, such as with "Magic Jammer" or "Riryoku Field" it does not do damage to your opponent.
*   "Black Pendant" activates in the Graveyard, so if it is destroyed when "Imperial Order" is on the field, it still does damage to your opponent.
*   You can chain to the activation of the effect of "Black Pendant" when it is sent to the Graveyard.

  
## BLACK POTAN

*   If “Black Potan” is removed from the field while being treated as a Tuner, you do not gain any Life Points.
*   If a Monster Token being treated as a Tuner is removed from the field, you gain Life Points.
*   If a Tuner monster that is equipped to “Relinquished” is removed from the field, you do not gain Life Points because it was not being treated as a monster.

  
## BLACK ROSE DRAGON  
> ① When this card is Synchro Summoned, you can destroy all cards on the field. ② Once per turn, you can remove from play 1 Plant-Type monster from your Graveyard to change 1 Defense Position monster your opponent controls to face-up Attack Position, and reduce its ATK to 0 until the End Phase.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates in the Summon response timing.
    *   If "Black Rose Dragon" activates its first effect, it is also destroyed.
*   The ② Ignition Effect targets 1 Defense Position monster your opponent controls.
    *   Removing 1 Plant-Type monster in your Graveyard from play is a cost.
    *   If the target is not changed to Attack Position by this effect, its ATK is not reduced to 0.
    *   If the target is in face-down Defense Position, its Flip Effect will activate after this effect resolves.
    *   A monster whose ATK was changed to 0 can have its ATK increased by cards/effects.
        *   The change is applied to 0 ATK.

  
## BLACK SALVO  
> When this card is Normal Summoned, you can Special Summon 1 Level 4 DARK Machine-Type monster from your Graveyard in face-up Defense Position. Its effect(s) is negated.

*   This is a Trigger Effect that targets the appropriate monster in your Graveyard. Once the target is Summoned, it is no longer targeted by this card.

  
## BLACK TYRANNO

*   If there is a Spell or Trap Card on your opponent's side of the field, "Black Tyranno" cannot attack directly.
*   If there is an Attack Position monster on your opponent's side of the field, "Black Tyranno" cannot attack directly.
*   If your opponent has only Defense Position monsters on his side of the field, "Black Tyranno" can attack directly even if some are face-down.
*   If an effect resolves during the Battle Step of "Black Tyranno"'s direct attack that results in a Spell Card, Trap Card, or Attack Position monster being on your opponent's side of the field, a replay occurs.
*   If your opponent's only monster is in face-up Defense Position, but it is equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", "Black Tyranno" must attack that monster if "Black Tyranno" attacks.

  
## BLACK WHIRLWIND  
> When a “Blackwing” monster is Normal Summoned to your side of the Field, you can add 1 “Blackwing” monster from your Deck to your hand that has less ATK than that monster.

*   This optional Trigger-like Effect activates in the Summon response timing.
*   Both "Black Whirlwind" and the Normal Summoned "Blackwing" monster must be face-up on the field.
*   This effect still resolves if control of the "Blackwing" monster changes during the chain.
*   The ATK (+ATK modifiers) of the "Blackwing" monster is assessed when resolving this effect.
*   A chain can be built if multiple copies of "Black Whirlwing" were triggered simultaneously.

  
## BLACKWING - ARMED WING

*   If “Blackwing Armed Wing” attacks a Defense Position monster, and that monster is changed to Attack Position before the Damage Step, it does not gain 500 ATK.

  
## BLACKWING - ARMOR MASTER  
> ① This card cannot be destroyed by battle, and you take no Battle Damage from battles involving this card. ② If this card attacks a monster, you can place 1 Wedge Counter on that monster at the end of the Damage Step (max. 1). ③ You can remove all Wedge Counters from your opponent's monsters to reduce the ATK and DEF of each monster that had a Wedge Counter to 0, until the End Phase.

*   This ① Continuous Effect can be negated by "Skill Drain".
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect places a "Wedge Counter" on a monster that battled Amor Master during Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step (when monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the Graveyard).
    *   This effect does not target the monster battling Armor Master.
    *   "Wedge Counters" fall off a monster if it is flipped face-down / leaves the field.
*   The ③ Ignition Effect removes all "Wedge Counters" from the field as cost.
    *   The ATK / DEF changes are reset when that monster is flipped face-down / leaves the field.

  
## BLACKWING - BLIZZARD THE FAR NORTH

*   The restriction against Special Summoning “Blackwing – Blizzard the Far North” is not an ‘effect’. The effect of “Blackwing – Blizzard the Far North” targets 1 “Blackwing” monster in your Graveyard.

  
## BLACKWING - ELPHIN THE RAVEN

*   The Trigger Effect of “Blackwing – Elphin the Raven” targets the opponent’s monster.
*   You can target a face-down monster with “Blackwing – Elphin the Raven” and flip it to face-up Attack Position.
*   If the monster has a Flip Effect, it will activate.

  
## BLACKWING - FANE THE STEEL CHAIN

*   This effect targets the Attack Position monster.

  
## BLACKWING - GALE THE WHIRLWIND  
> Ⓢ If you control a “Blackwing” monster other than “Blackwing – Gale the Whirlwind”, you can Special Summon this card from your hand.  
① Once per turn, you can halve the ATK and DEF of 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.

*   This Ⓢ Special Summon does not start a chain.
*   The ① Ignition Effect targets. The target’s ATK is halved so long as it remains face-up on the field.
    *   Non-Continuous Effects (such as Gale's) that halve ATK/DEF calculated by a Continuous Effect (such as "Tragoedia"'s) prevent the Continuous Effect from recalculating. This locks the new ATK/DEF of that monster so long as it is face-up on the field \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/105886-tragoedia-being-summoned-while-black-garden-is-active/&tab=comments#comment-2112568)\].
        *   Example 1: A monster equipped with “United We Stand” whose ATK was halved by Gale WILL NOT have its ATK changed when the number of monsters on the field changes.
        *   Example 2: Gale's effect targets a "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" equipped with "Axe of Despair". Its ATK is reduced to 2000, and will not change even if "Axe of Despair" is destroyed or has its effect negated. This ruling also applies to temporary ATK modifiers (ex: "Rush Recklessly").

  
## BLACKWING - KALUT THE MOON SHADOW  
> When a "Blackwing" monster you control attacks or is attacked, you can send this card from your hand to the Graveyard during the Damage Step to have that monster gain 1400 ATK until the End Phase.

*   Sending “Blackwing – Kalut the Moon Shadow” to the graveyard is a cost to activate its effect.
*   The effect of “Blackwing – Kalut the Moon Shadow” does not target.
*   You can send “Blackwing – Kalut the Moon Shadow” to the Graveyard during either player’s turn, as it is a Quick Effect.
*   This effect CAN be activated in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation of the Damage Step.

  
## BLACKWING - MISTRAL THE SILVER SHIELD

*   This is a Trigger Effect that activates when this card is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.
*   Reducing the [Battle Damage](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Battle_Damage) to 0 does not start a Chain.

  
## BLACKWING - SIROCCO THE DAWN  
> Ⓤ If your opponent controls a monster and you control no monsters, you can Normal Summon or Set this card without Tributing. ① Once per turn, you can select 1 face-up "Blackwing" monster you control. It gains ATK equal to the total ATK of all face-up "Blackwing" monsters on the field except itself. Ⓒ Monsters other than the selected monster cannot attack the turn you activate this effect.

*   The Ⓤ Unclassified Effect allows this monsster to be Normal Summoned / Set without Tribute.
    *   This effect does not activate.
*   The ① Ignition Effect targets 1 "Blackwing" monster you control (including itself).
    *   This effect CANNOT be activated during your Main Phase 2.
    *   Your opponent’s “Blackwing” monsters are also counted towards the ATK gain.
    *   The ATK boost lasts until the End Phase.
*   The Ⓒ Condition applies so long as the activation of the ① Ignition Effect was not negated.
    *   Monsters Summoned after this effect resolved cannot attack this turn.
    *   If the targeted monster is no longer on the field when the effect resolves, all your other monsters still cannot attack this turn.
    *   If the activation of the effect of “Blackwing – Sirocco the Dawn” is negated, then your other monsters may attack this turn.
    *   If you have 2 copies of “Blackwing – Sirocco the Dawn” and target 2 different monsters with them, neither of those monsters can attack this turn.
    *   If “Skill Drain” is activated after the effect of “Blackwing – Sirocco the Dawn” resolves, then the effect is not negated. The ATK boost remains, and the other monsters cannot attack this turn.

  
## BLACKWING - SHURA THE BLUE FLAME  
> ① When this card destroys an opponent's monster by battle and sends it to the Graveyard, you can Special Summon 1 "Blackwing" monster with 1500 or less ATK from your Deck. That monster's effect(s) is negated.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates at the start of Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step (when monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the Graveyard) of the Damage Step.
    *   This effect only activates if Shura is face-up on the field (ex: "Goyo Guardian" and [MANY MORE](https://www.duelingbook.com/deck?id=7967783)).
    *   This effect will form a chain (as per SEGOC) with and other cards / effect that activate in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step (ex: "Michizure", "Legendary Jujitsu Master").
*   This ① optional Trigger Effect will NOT activate if:
    *   Shura battled a monster with equal ATK and both were destroyed.
    *   Shura was removed from the field by the effect of "D.D. Warrior Lady".
    *   Shura was removed from the field by a Flip Effect (ex: "Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter" or "Penguin Soldier").
*   The Special Summoned monster's effect(s) is negated so long as it remains face-up on the field.
*   "Torrential Tribute" and "Royal Oppression" CANNOT be activated at any point in the Damage Step.

  
## BLACKWING - SILVERWIND THE ASCENDENT  
> ① When this card is Synchro Summoned, you can select and destroy up to 2 face-up monsters on the field with DEF lower than this card's ATK. Ⓒ You cannot conduct your Battle Phase the turn you activate this effect. ② The next time a "Blackwing" monster you control would be destroyed by battle during your opponent's turn, it is not destroyed, this effect only happens once.

*   You can Special Summon this monster with the effect of “Blackwing – Vayu the Emblem of Honor." You must remove from play a Level 7 “Blackwing” monster alongside Vayu to do so.
*   The ① optional Trigger Effect can only be activated when this monster is Synchro Summoned.
    *   This effect does NOT activate when Special Summoned by "Blackwing - Vayu the Emblem of Honor".
    *   You can activate this effect even if “Skill Drain” is active. However, the Ⓒ Condition will still apply, and you will not be able to conduct your Battle Phase, even though the effect was negated.
    *   If a monster targeted by this effect gains more DEF than Silverwind’s ATK, it will not be destroyed.
    *   If a monster targeted by this effect is flipped face-down, it will not be destroyed. Any remaining face-up targets will be destroyed.
    *   If this card is flipped face-down its ATK cannot be verified, so no monsters will be destroyed.
*   The ② Continuous Effect does not start a chain. You don’t choose when to use the “_next time a “Blackwing” monster would be destroyed by battle_” effect. It is automatically applied the next time your “Blackwing” monster would be destroyed by battle during your opponent’s turn.

  
## BLACKWING - VAYU THE EMBLEM OF HONOR  
> ① If this card is face-up on the field, you cannot use it for a Synchro Summon. ② If this card is in your Graveyard, you can remove from play this card plus 1 non-Tuner “Blackwing” monster in your Graveyard, and Special Summon 1 “Blackwing” Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck whose Level equals the total Levels of the removed monsters. The effect(s) of that Synchro Monster is negated.

*   The ① Continuous Effect CAN be negated (by "Skill Drain" or if Vayu is Special Summoned by Shura).
*   The ② Ignition Effect targets a "Blackwing" Monster in your Graveyard.
    *   Vayu + 1 non-Tuner "Blackwing" monster are removed from play when this effect resolves. This is not a cost.
    *   Both monsters must be removed from play by Vayu’s effect to perform the Special Summon.
        *   Example: Player A activates Vayu's effect targeting Sirocco in their Graveyard. Player B chains "D.D. Crow" and targets that same Sirocco. When the chain resolves, Vayu could not remove both itself and its target from play in the Graveyard. Thus, Player A's Vayu is not remove from play, and no "Blackwing" Synchro monster is Special Summoned.
    *   This effect does not perform a Synchro Summon. It can be activated while "Discord" is active.
    *   Since the monster was not properly Synchro Summoned, it cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard / removed from play (ex: "Call of the Haunted", "Return from the Different Dimension").

  
## BLADE KNIGHT

*   If you control "Blade Knight" and a face-down monster on your side of the field, "Blade Knight"’s second effect is not applied because you control another monster (whether it is face-up or face-down is not important).
*   If you have two "Blade Knights", then their second effects are not applied because for each one, you have another monster on the field besides the "Blade Knight".
*   If "Blade Knight" destroys a Flip Effect Monster like "Slate Warrior", even that monster’s non-Flip effects are negated. So in this case, "Slate Warrior" does not reduce the ATK and DEF of the "Blade Knight" that destroyed it, because "Blade Knight" negates its effect.
*   If "Blade Knight" destroys "The Immortal of Thunder", its effect is negated. If your opponent had already gained the 3000 Life Points, then your opponent does not lose the 5000 Life Points. If "Blade Knight" attacked "The Immortal of Thunder" while it was face-down, your opponent neither gains nor loses Life Points from "The Immortal of Thunder"’s effect.
*   If "Blade Knight" destroys "Spear Cretin", "Spear Cretin"’s effect is not applied.
*   The effect of a Flip Effect monster destroyed by "Blade Knight" is negated while the destroyed card is in the Graveyard. If the monster is Set again on the field, then the Flip Effect is activated when it’s flipped again.
*   If "Blade Knight" attacks a face-down Attack Position Flip Effect Monster with equal ATK, and both monsters are destroyed, then "Blade Knight"’s effect is applied because it destroyed the monster, and the monster’s effect is negated.

  
## BLAST ASMODIAN

*   If you activate “Call of the Haunted” targeting “Blast Asmodian”, then another card is chained to “Call of the Haunted”, the effect of “Blast Asmodian” does not activate and inflict damage after the chain resolves.
*   Only Spell and Trap Card activations will activate the effect of “Blast Asmodian”. Effects that may activate from previously-activated Spell and Trap Cards are not taken into account.
*   "Blast Asmodian"'s effect is a Trigger Effect. When it activates you can chain the activation of a Spell or Trap Card. After that chain resolves, "Blast Asmodian"'s effect will Trigger again, and start a new chain.

  
## BLAST HELD BY A TRIBUTE

*   When your opponent attacks with a monster that you Tribute Summoned, and your opponent took control of, you can activate "Blast Held by a Tribute".
*   Monsters like "Tyrant Dragon" cannot negate the effect of "Blast Held by a Tribute".
*   In order to inflict 1000 points of damage to your opponent, you must destroy all monsters on your opponent's side of the field first. So if you activate "Blast Held by a Tribute", and your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" or "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" so that your opponent has no monsters to destroy, then "Blast Held by a Tribute" inflicts no damage.

  
## BLAST JUGGLER

*   "Blast Juggler" targets 2 face-up monsters with 1000 or less ATK.
*   "Blast Juggler"'s effect cannot be activated if there is only 1 face-up monster (excluding "Blast Juggler") with 1000 or less ATK.

  
## BLAST MAGICIAN

*   If "Rush Recklessly" is chained to the effect of "Blast Magician", and the ATK of the target monster is now higher than 700 x the number of Spell Counters removed, the effect of "Blast Magician" disappears. You cannot remove additional Spell Counters to increase the effect.
*   This is an effect that targets.
*   You must remove at least 1 Spell Counter. You cannot activate the effect and remove zero Spell Counters.
*   You place a Spell Counter on this card when the Spell Card resolves, so if "Magic Jammer" is used to negate the Spell Card's activation then you do not place a Spell Counter on this monster. But if "Imperial Order" is chained to the Spell Card, you still place a Spell Counter on this monster because the activation of the Spell Card was not negated. If the Spell Card was a Continuous, Equip, or Field Spell Card, and “Dust Tornado” is chained to its activation and destroys it before it resolves you still place a Spell Counter because the activation of the card was not negated.
*   "Blast Magician" must have been face-up on the field when the Spell Card was activated (and when it resolves) in order to receive a Spell Counter.

  
## BLAST WITH CHAIN

*   This card targets 1 monster.
*   If you use "Emergency Provisions", it sends Spell & Trap Cards to the Graveyard, it does not destroy them, so if you send this card to the Graveyard with "Emergency Provisions", this card's effect will not be activated. The same applies to "Woodland Sprite".
*   If you equip this card to "Gearfried the Iron Knight", then this card's effect will be activated because it was destroyed by a card effect.
*   When this card is negated by "Solemn Judgment" or "7 Tools of the Bandit", this card is negated and destroyed and the effect does NOT activate.
*   You can activate this card during the Damage Step because it specifically modifies ATK.
*   You cannot target Tyrant Dragon with this card and if you attempt to, then this card is negated and destroyed, and you do NOT get the effect of this card.
*   If a monster attacks "Gearfried the Iron Knight", and you activate "Blast with Chain" during the Damage Step, "Blast With Chain" is destroyed and gets its effect, so you can destroy the attacking monster before Damage Calculation.
*   If your opponent activates "Mystical Space Typhoon" targeting your face-down "Blast with Chain", and you chain "Blast with Chain", you still get "Blast with Chain"'s effect.
*   If this card is destroyed in the middle of a resolving chain, its effect will start a new chain after current one resolves.

  
## BLASTING FUSE

*   The effect of “Blasting Fuse” also destroys itself.
*   Even if an effect is chained to “Blasting Fuse” that removes 1 of the cards in that column, the effect is still applied and all remaining cards in the column are destroyed.

  
## BLASTING THE RUINS

*   Even if you activate "Blasting the Ruins" and an effect is chained that reduces your Graveyard to less than 30 cards, "Blasting the Ruins" still resolves because the condition was correct at the time of activation.

  
## BLAZE ACCELERATOR  
> ① You can send 1 Pyro-Type monster with 500 or less ATK from your hand to the Graveyard to destroy 1 monster your opponent controls, Ⓒ but you cannot declare an attack during this turn if you do.

*   The Ⓒ Condition prevents you from attacking during the turn the ① effect was activated \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=855510)\].
    *   This applies even if the ① effect failed to destroy the target.
    *   This applies even if a card/effect is chained to the ① effect that destroys "Blaze Accelerator".
    *   This applies to monster unaffected by Spell Cards / Effects (ex: "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6").

  
## BLAZEWING BUTTERFLY  
> Ⓤ This card is treated as a Normal Monster while face-up on the field or in the Graveyard. Ⓒ While this card is face-up on the field, you can Normal Summon it to have it be treated as an Effect Monster with this effect:  
● ① You can Tribute this card to Special Summon 1 Gemini monster from your Graveyard, except "Blazewing Butterfly". A Gemini monster Special Summoned by this effect is treated as an Effect Monster, and gains its effect.

*   The Ⓤ Unclassified Effect applies on the field and in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect can be negated while "Blazewing Butterfly" is face-up on the field, causing it to be treated as an effect monster.
*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated. This is not an effect.
*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect targets a Gemini monster in your Graveyard. It will be negated by "Necrovalley".

  
## BLAZING HIITA

*   If a monster Special Summoned by this card’s effect is flipped face-down, it will not be destroyed when this card is destroyed.

  
## BLIND DESTRUCTION

*   Rolling a die is not optional, you must roll one each of your Standby Phases. If you have two copies of "Blind Destruction" active on the field you roll two dice each of your Standby Phases.

  
## BLINDLY LOYAL GOBLIN

*   If your opponent takes control of your "Blindly Loyal Goblin" with "Change of Heart" and flips it face-up, control of the monster does not return to you.
*   If you Special Summon your opponent's "Blindly Loyal Goblin" with "Monster Reborn", and "Remove Brainwashing" is activated, control of "Blindly Loyal Goblin" does not return to your opponent.
*   Your opponent cannot use "Change of Heart", "Snatch Steal", or "Brain Control" on your face-up "Blindly Loyal Goblin".
*   Neither player can activate "Creature Swap" if the only monster you control is "Blindly Loyal Goblin". If you control "Blindly Loyal Goblin" and 1 other monster when "Creature Swap" is activated, you must select the other monster.
*   If your opponent tries to use "Change of Heart" on your face-down "Blindly Loyal Goblin", and you chain "Ceasefire" to flip it face-up, the effect of "Change of Heart" is negated.
*   Your opponent cannot target your "Blindly Loyal Goblin" with the effect of "Relinquished" or "Thousand-Eyes Restrict".

  
## BLOCKMAN

*   If "Blue Thunder T-45" is destroyed by a card effect after damage calculation, its effect still activates.
*   Even while "Skill Drain" is active, the "Thunder Option Token" cannot be Tributed for a Tribute Summon.

  
## BONDING - H2O

*   Tributing 2 “Hydrogeddon” and 1 “Oxygeddon” is a cost to activate “Bonding H2O”. You can Tribute face-down monsters for this cost.
*   You can use “Bonding – H20” to Special Summon a “Water Dragon” from your Graveyard, even if it was not properly Summoned previously.

  
## BONE TEMPLE BLOCK

*   Discarding a card is part of the resolution of “Bone Temple Block.”
*   The effects of “Bone Temple Block” happen in sequence, so if you discard “Archfiend of Gilfer,” it will miss the timing on and not activate its effect.
*   "Born Temple Block" targets the Monster Cards selected by each player.
*   The turn player selects a monster first. If you activate “Bone Temple Block” during your opponent’s turn, your opponent selects first.
*   If your opponent is under the effects of “Scapegoat” and cannot Special Summon, you can still activate “Bone Temple Block.” In this case, only you would Special Summon a monster.
*   You cannot activate “Bone Temple Block” if there are no monsters in either Graveyard to Special Summon.

  
## BOOK OF ECLIPSE

*   Flipping your opponent's face-down monsters face-up does not start a Chain.
*   If your opponent has face-down monsters that were not flipped face-down by "Book of Eclipse", they are also flipped face-up.

  
## BOOK OF LIFE  
> Special Summon 1 Zombie-Type monster from your Graveyard and remove from play 1 monster from your opponent's Graveyard.

*   This targets 1 Zombie-Type monster in your Graveyard and 1 monster in your opponent's Graveyard.
    *   This effect resolves both parts simultaneously.
    *   If the targeted Zombie-type monster leaves your Graveyard, the target in your opponent's graveyard is still removed from play \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=507776), [REF2](http://web.archive.org/web/20071206033331/http:/entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/847687.aspx)\].
    *   If the targeted monster leaves in your opponent's Graveyard, or if you cannot remove it from play, you still Special Summon the targeted Zombie-type monster in your Graveyard \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=2736), [REF2](http://web.archive.org/web/20071205210551/http:/entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/844031.aspx)\].
    *   If the target in your Graveyard is no longer a Zombie-Type monster, it is not Special Summoned, but the target in your opponent's Graveyard is still removed from play.
*   You cannot activate this card unless both Graveyards have 1+ legal targets.
*   You cannot activate this card if your opponent controls "Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer" / "Imperial Iron Wall".

  
## BOOK OF MOON  
> Flip 1 face-up monster on the field into face-down Defense Position.

*   This effect targets 1 face-up monster.
*   A monster flipped face-down remembers:
    *   if its Battle Position was changed this turn.
    *   that it declared an attack this turn.
    *   that it was Normal / Flip / Tribute / Ritual / Fusion / Synchro / Special Summoned.
    *   on what turn it was Summoned.
    *   which Synchro / Fusion / Ritual Material Monsters were used for its Summon.
*   A monster flipped face-down forgets:
    *   the properties of cards used for its Summon (name, Attribute, Type, etc.).
    *   what method / effect Summoned it (ex: "Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord").
    *   where it was Summoned from.
    *   lingering effects that previously applies to it (like "Limited Removal").
    *   if it used its "once per turn" effect(s) earlier this turn (read about exceptions [HERE](https://www.edisonformat.com/home/basic-strategy-flip-flop-fundamentals)).
    *   if it was Normal Summoned again (in the case of Gemini Monsters).
    *   if it had been Flip Summoned.
*   You cannot flip a Monster Token face-down because Monster Tokens are always face-up.
*   You cannot activate "Book of Moon" while "Light of Intervention" is active.
*   This card cannot be activated during the Damage Step.

  
## BOOK OF TAIYOU  
> Flip 1 face-down monster on the field into face-up Attack Position.

*   This effect targets 1 face-down monster on the field.
*   This effect DOES NOT perform a Flip Summon (a manual player action).
*   Flip Effect will still activate.

  
## BOSS RUSH

*   You cannot activate “Boss Rush” if you have already Normal Summoned or Set a monster this turn.
*   “Boss Rush” must be face-up on the field when the “B.E.S.” or “Big Core” monster is destroyed for you to use its effect. If the monster is destroyed, and then afterwards you activate “Boss Rush”, you do not get to Special Summon for that monster’s destruction.
*   You can use the effect of “Boss Rush” during your opponent’s turn, as long as it was already face-up on the field and an appropriate monster was destroyed during that turn.
*   If more than 1 appropriate monster is destroyed during the turn, you can still only Special Summon 1 monster during the End Phase for “Boss Rush”. If you have 2 copies of “Boss Rush” on the field, then you can Special Summon 1 monster for each copy of “Boss Rush”.
*   Activating the effect of “Boss Rush” during an End Phase is an effect that can be chained to.

  
## BOTANICAL LION  
> ① This card gains 300 ATK for each face-up Plant-Type monster you control. ② Control of this face-up card cannot switch.

*   The ① Continuous Effect constantly re-calculates the ATK gain. This effect does not activate.
    *   This effect stops re-calculating if a non-continuous effect (ex: "Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind") changes the ATK value of "Botanical Lion".
*   The ② Continuous Effect prevents any attempt to change control of this face-up card.
    *   This effect prevents "Botanical Lion" from becoming an Equip Spell by the effect of "Relinquished".
    *   A face-down "Botanical Lion" can still change control (by "Mind Control" / "Creature Swap").
    *   A face-down "Botanical Lion" stolen by "Mind Control" and flipped face-up DOES NOT return to its owner's side of the field during the End Phase.
    *   This effect DOES NOT prevent "Goyo Guardian" from Special Summoning a "Botanical Lion".

  
## BOTTOMLESS SHIFTING SAND

*   If there are multiple monsters tied for the highest ATK, they are all destroyed.
*   If "Bottomless Shifting Sand" is active and "Tyrant Dragon" is the monster with the highest ATK, "Tyrant Dragon" is destroyed because "Bottomless Shifting Sand" does not target a monster.

  
## BOTTOMLESS TRAP HOLE  
> Activate only when your opponent Summons a monster(s) with 1500 or more ATK. Destroy and remove from play the monster(s).

*   This card can only respond to a Normal / Flip / Special Summon of a monster with 1500(+) ATK.
    *   Only monsters whose current ATK (including ATK changes) is 1500(+) are destroyed.
    *   If a monster(s) is flipped face-down, its ATK cannot be verified and so it is not destroyed.
    *   A destroyed monster(s) is removed from play, it is never sent to the Graveyard \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=930293)\].
    *   This effect does not target. It can remove from play multiple monsters Summoned simultaneously.
    *   Monsters Summoned simultaneously (by "Return from the Different Dimension") with less than 1500 ATK (or that were Special Summoned face-down) are not destroyed / removed from play.
    *   If the opponent activates "Monster Reborn" and chains "Call of the Haunted", "Bottomless Trap Hole" can activate after that Chain resolves, destroying the monster Summoned in Chain Link 1.
*   You cannot activate this card during the Damage Step.
*   You cannot activate this card after "Jinzo" is Summoned.
*   You cannot activate this card if a monster(s) is Normal / Special Summoned as Chain Link 2+.

  
## BOUNTIFUL ARTEMIS  
> ① Draw 1 card from your Deck each time a Counter Trap Card is activated.

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not start a chain.
*   "Bountiful Artemis" must be face-up on the field in order to apply this effect.
*   This effect will not apply for any Counter Trap Cards which might [negate the Summon](https://www.edisonformat.com/summons.html) of Artemis.
*   You will draw 1 card immediately after a Counter Trap’s effects have resolved.
*   This effect will activate even if your opponent is the one who resolved the effect of a Counter Trap.
*   If “Seven Tools of the Bandit” negates the activation of another Counter Trap Card (ex: “Magic Jammer”), you do not draw a card for “Magic Jammer” since its activation was negated.

  
## BOWGANIAN

*   You can use "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Bowganian"'s effect.
*   "Bowganian"'s effect is a Trigger Effect.

  
## BRAIN CONTROL  
> Pay 800 LifePoints. Select 1 face-up monster your opponent controls. Take control of it until the End Phase.

*   Paying 800 Life Points is a cost. This effect targets a face-up monster.
    *   The targeted monster must remain face-up in order for control to be changed.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down (by "Book of Moon"), "Brain Control" resolves without effect.
*   A monster affected by "Brain Control" that is flipped face-down later (by "Book of Moon") in the turn is still returned during the End Phase.
*   If you control your opponent’s monster with "Brain Control" and remove it from play with "Dimensionhole", during your following Standby Phase when the monster is returned to your side of the field it immediately returns to your opponent’s control.
*   You cannot activate "Brain Control" if your Monster Card Zones are all occupied.

  
## BRAIN GOLEM  
> ① Effects of face-up LIGHT monsters are negated. ② If this card destroys a LIGHT monster by battle, it can attack once again in a row.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies so long as "Brain Golem" is face-up on the field.
    *   This effect only affects LIGHT monsters while they are face-up.
    *   The effect of “Sphere of Chaos” is negated if “Brain Golem” is on the field, so “Sphere of Chaos” is not treated as a LIGHT monster.
    *   If “Brain Golem” becomes a LIGHT monster, its effect is negated but all other LIGHT monsters are applied normally.
    *   “Brain Golem” only negates the effects of face-up LIGHT monsters on the field. If a monster is no longer face-up on the field, its effect is not negated by “Brain Golem.”
*   The ② Trigger Effect activates in Substep 7 of the [Damage Step](https://www.edisonformat.com/battle-phase.html) (End of the Damage Step) when monsters marked for destruction by battle are sent to the Graveyard.
    *   If “Brain Golem” destroys a monster that was LIGHT on the field but is no longer LIGHT in the Graveyard (because of “Scroll of Bewitchment” or “DNA Transplant”) it can still attack once again.

  
## BRAIN JACKER

*   If this monster is attacked while face-down, and is destroyed as a result of battle, its effect does not activate. (Unlike “Kiseitai” because “Kiseitai” has an effect preventing damage calculation.)
*   The effect of “Brain Jacker” that increases Life Points can be chained to.

  
## BRAIN RESEARCH LAB  
> ① Once per turn, you can Normal Summon 1 Psychic-Type monster in addition to your Normal Summon or Set. ② If successful, place 1 Psychic Counter on this card. ③ You can also place 1 Psychic Counter on this card instead of paying Life Points to activate any Psychic-Type monster's effect that you control. ④ When this card is removed from the field, the controller of this card takes 1000 damage for each Psychic Counter on it.

*   None of the effects of “Brain Research Lab” start a Chain.
    *   The ①, ②, ③, and ④ effects are all Continuous-like.
    *   Each effect is separate from the rest.
*   The ① Continuous-like Effect may be used before you perform your standard Normal Summon / Set.
    *   This effect can be used to gain either a Normal Summon or a Normal Tribute Summon.
    *   This effect cannot be used to gain an additional Set of a Psychic-Type monster.
    *   This effect can only be used once per turn, even if you play a second copy of “Brain Research Lab.”
    *   You can still use this effect to Normal Summon a Psychic-Type monster after gaining an additional Summon by “Double Summon” / “Ultimate Offering”.
    *   You still Tribute when using this effect to Summon Level 5 or higher Psychic-Type monster.
*   The ② Continuous-like Effect does not start a chain.
*   The ③ Continuous-like Effect only applies for the activated effects of Psychic-Type monsters.
    *   A monster whose Type is Psychic (by “DNA Surgery”) can activate its effects that require a Life Point payment by placing 1 Psychic Counter on this card.
    *   You cannot place a Psychic Counter on this card to activate an effect that you would not have enough Life Points to activate otherwise.
    *   You cannot place a Psychic Counter on this card to activate the effect of a card like “Psychic Commander.”
    *   You cannot place a Psychic Counter to use the effect of “Telekinetic Shocker” or other such effects that are not an effect activation that start a Chain.
*   The ④ Continous-like Effect is mandatory, though it does not start a chain.
    *   You take damage for each Psychic Counter even if this card was returned to your hand / Deck, .
    *   If “Brain Research Lab's” effects are negated by "Spell Canceller", remove all Psychic Counters.

  
## BRANCH!

*   The effect of “Branch!” can be chained to.
*   All of the Fusion Material Monsters do not need to be in the Graveyard in order to use the effect of “Branch!”. As long as 1 of the monsters used for the Fusion Summon is in the Graveyard, it can be Special Summoned.
*   The Fusion Material Monster can still be Special Summoned with “Branch!” even if it has been Special Summoned by another effect and then sent back to the Graveyard, or even if it was removed from play and returned to the Graveyard.
*   If a fusion substitute monster, such as “King of the Swamp”, can be Special Summoned with “Branch!” if it was used in a Fusion Summon.

  
## BREAK! DRAW!

*   The effect to draw 1 card starts a Chain. Destroying “Break! Draw!” during your 3rd End Phase is not an effect and can’t be negated.
*   The effect to draw happens at the end of the Damage Step after the opponent’s monster is sent to the Graveyard.

  
## BREAKER THE MAGICAL WARRIOR

*   Placing a Spell Counter on "Breaker, the Magical Warrior" is a chain that begins after it is Summoned. If your opponent chains "Trap Hole" or "Ring of Destruction" to the placement of a Spell Counter on "Breaker, the Magical Warrior", "Trap Hole" / "Ring of Destruction" resolves before the Spell Counter is placed on "Breaker, the Magical Warrior", so you cannot chain "Breaker, the Magical Warrior"'s effect.
*   "Breaker, the Magical Warrior"'s effect is Spell Speed 1 so you cannot chain it to the activation of a Spell Card.
*   You can use "Breaker, the Magical Warrior"'s effect multiple times in the same turn as long as you can keep re-supplying him with Spell Counters (using "Pitch-Black Power Stone", etc.).
*   Removing a Spell Counter is a cost; if you remove a Spell Counter from "Breaker, the Magical Warrior" and your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction", the Spell Counter has already been removed so "Ring of Destruction" deals 1600 damage to each player; "Breaker, the Magical Warrior"'s effect that destroys a card is still applied even though "Breaker, the Magical Warrior" himself has been destroyed at that point.
*   If I chain "Ring of Destruction" to the placement of a Spell Counter on "Breaker, the Magical Warrior", "Ring of Destruction" does 1600 damage to each player because the action of placing the Spell Counter has not resolved.

  
## BREAKTHROUGH!

*   This card's effect is only applied to “Great Shogun Shien” and “Six Samurai” monsters that are face-up on your side of the field when this card resolves.

  
## BRIONAC, DRAGON OF THE ICE BARRIER  
> ① You can discard and number of cards to the Graveyard to return the same number of cards from the field to the hand.

*   The ① Ignition Effect and can be activated multiple times per turn.
*   This effect targets cards equal to the number of cards discarded to the Graveyard.
*   Discarding a card(s) to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   This effect CANNOT be activated while "Macro Cosmos" is active.
*   If this effect targets multiple copies of "Machina Fortress" your opponent controls, when you go to resolve the effect of Brionac: first resolve the Continuous Effects of each targeted "Machina Fortress", then resolve Brionac’s effect and return those copies of “Machina Fortress” to the hand.

  
## BROKEN BLOCKER

*   Refer to the destroyed monster's ATK and DEF while it was on the field, including any gain/losses to its ATK and DEF.

  
## BROWW, HUNTSMAN OF DARK WORLD  
Also see rulings for “Dark World Monsters”.

*   If this card is discarded from your hand by the opponent’s card effect, you draw both cards at the same time. If you had “Solemn Wishes” on the field, you would only gain 500 Life Points.

  
## BUBBLE CRASH

*   This card can be activated when EITHER player has 6 cards or more combined in hand and on the field.
*   All selected cards on both players’ side of the field are sent to their respective Graveyards simultaneously.
*   Monster Tokens count towards these 6 cards, and can be selected by this card’s effect (but they will be taken off the field instead of being sent to the Graveyard.
*   Once activated, "Bubble Crash" itself does not count towards the 6 cards.
*   If "Premature Burial" is equipped to a monster on the field, you can select "Premature Burial" to be sent to the Graveyard and the previously equipped monster will remain on the field, since "Premature Burial" was not destroyed.
*   If you select "Toon World" to be sent to the Graveyard, your Toon Monsters are not destroyed because "Toon World" was not destroyed.
*   If you send "Call of the Haunted" to the Graveyard, the monster Special Summoned by its effect is destroyed.
*   If "Witch of the Black Forest" or "Sangan" is sent to the Graveyard, their effects do activate.

  
## BUBBLE SHUFFLE

*   “Bubble Shuffle” is an effect that targets 2 monsters.
*   If either target of “Bubble Shuffle” is changed to Defense Position or removed from the field before “Bubble Shuffle” resolves, the entire effect of “Bubble Shuffle” disappears.
*   You can target the opponent’s “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” with “Soul Exchange” and Tribute it for “Bubble Shuffle”.
*   If there is no monster in your hand with “Elemental Hero” in the card name, you cannot activate “Bubble Shuffle”.
*   You need a face-up Attack Position “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” on the field to activate “Bubble Shuffle”. If he’s in Defense Position you cannot activate it.

  
## BURIAL FROM A DIFFERENT DIMENSION

*   You may select cards from either players Removed Zone. They will be returned to their respective owner's Graveyards.

  
## BURNING ALGAE

*   "Burning Algae"'s effect activates when sent to the Graveyard from the field, your hand, or your Deck.
*   "Burning Algae"'s effect activates in the Graveyard, so when a face-down "Burning Algae" is sent to the Graveyard, or "Burning Algae" in your opponent's hand is sent to your Graveyard, the effect is activated.
*   "Burning Algae"'s effect cannot be negated by "Skill Drain".
*   When you Tribute "Burning Algae" to Tribute Summon "Dark Magician of Chaos", "Burning Algae"'s effect is Step 1 of a chain and "Dark Magician of Chaos"' effect is Step 2.

  
## BURNING BEAST  
> ① Once per turn, during your Main Phase, if you control this monster on the field, you can equip it to your "Freezing Beast" as an Equip Card, OR unequip the Union equipment and Special Summon this card in face-up Attack Position. ② While equipped to a monster by this card's effect, each time the equipped monster inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent, destroy 1 face-up Spell or Trap Card on the field. Ⓒ (1 monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the equipped monster is destroyed as a result of battle, destroy this card instead.)

*   You may use the effect of "Burning Beast" to destroy a Spell or Trap Card on your side of the field.
*   If a monster equipped with "Burning Beast" attacks your opponent's Life Points directly, and "Robbin' Goblin" is the only face-up Spell or Trap Card on the field, the turn player chooses whether to resolve "Robbin' Goblin"'s effect first or resolve "Burning Beast"'s effect first. If the effect of "Burning Beast" is resolved first and destroys "Robbin' Goblin", then "Robbin' Goblin"'s effect is not applied because it is a Continuous Trap Card that is no longer in play.

  
## BURST STREAM OF DESTRUCTION

*   If you activate "Burst Stream of Destruction", and the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" is removed from the field with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" or "Compulsory Evacuation Device", or flipped face-down with "Book of Moon", or destroyed by "Ring of Destruction", "Burst Stream of Destruction"'s effect still resolves.
*   You can activate "Burst Stream of Destruction" when you cannot have a Battle Phase because of "Frozen Soul", "D. D. Border Line", "Soul Exchange", or "Great Long Nose".
*   It is an effect of "Burst Stream of Destruction" that "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" cannot attack, so if "Non-Spellcasting Area" is on the field, "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" CAN attack. If "Imperial Order" is activated later, "Burst Stream of Destruction"'s effect is negated and "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" CAN attack.
*   If "Burst Stream of Destruction"'s activation is negated by "Magic Jammer", then "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" can attack.
*   NO copies of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" can attack the turn that "Burst Stream of Destruction"'s effect is applied, even if they are Summoned after "Burst Stream of Destruction" is played.

  
## BUSTER RANCHER

*   If the equipped monster’s ATK is raised above 1000 points, by any effect other than "Buster Rancher"’s own effect, "Buster Rancher" is destroyed.
*   You can equip 2 copies of "Buster Rancher" to the same monster but because of "Buster Rancher"’s effect, when you increase the ATK by 1 "Buster Rancher" effect, the other "Buster Rancher" is destroyed.
*   If "Injection Fairy Lily" is equipped with "Buster Rancher", and you use her effect to increase her ATK, "Buster Rancher" is destroyed. If "Injection Fairy Lily" battles a monster equipped with "Buster Rancher", and her effect is used to increase her ATK, then "Buster Rancher"’s effect activates and increases the ATK of the other monster.

  
## BUTTERFLY DAGGER - ELMA

*   Missing the Timing: Because the effect of “Butterfly Dagger – Elma” is an optional “when… you can” Trigger Effect, "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" being sent to the Graveyard has to be the very last thing that happened in order for you to activate its effect. So if it is destroyed in the middle of a chain, you cannot return it to your hand. Example: If the turn player activates "Pot of Greed", and the opponent chains "Mystical Space Typhoon" to destroy "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" during the chain, it cannot return to the owner's hand.
*   If the monster that "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" is equipped to is destroyed as a result of battle, or by a card effect like "Sakuretsu Armor" or "Fissure", then "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" cannot return to your hand because it is no longer equipped to a monster. However, if the monster and the "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" are destroyed simultaneously by a card like "Final Destiny", then you can return it to your hand.
*   While "Imperial Order" is active, if "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, it can return to your hand.
*   When you activate "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" and your opponent chains "Mystical Space Typhoon", it cannot return to your hand.
*   When "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" is "sent to the Graveyard" without being "destroyed", such as with "Woodland Sprite", it cannot return to your hand.
*   If "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" is negated and destroyed by "Ryu Senshi" or "Freed the Matchless General", it cannot return to your hand.
*   While "Morale Boost" is active, if you equip "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" to "Gearfried the Iron Knight", 1) Increase your Life Points for "Morale Boost", 2) destroy "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" with "Gearfried the Iron Knight"'s effect, 3) inflict damage for "Morale Boost" when "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" is sent to the Graveyard, 4) the owner of "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" can return it to his/her hand.
*   If "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" is destroyed during the Damage Step, such as by the effect of "Cliff the Trap Remover", you cannot activate the effect that returns "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" to the hand.

  
## BY ORDER OF THE EMPEROR

*   The effect of "By Order of the Emperor" is chained to the effect of the Normal Summoned Effect Monster.
*   The effect of "By Order of the Emperor" can be chained to negate "King Tiger Wanghu"'s effect.
*   If you have 2 face-up copies of "By Order of the Emperor", you can only chain the effect of 1 of them, not both.

  
## BYSER SHOCK

*   You can chain against the effect of "Byser Shock".
*   A Trap Card like "Ceasefire" that is chained to the activation of "Byser Shock"’s effect is not returned to the hand.

  
## CAIUS THE SHADOW MONARCH  
> ① When this card is Tribute Summoned, remove from play 1 card on the field. If it was a DARK Monster Card, inflict 1000 damage to your opponent.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates when Caius is successfully Tribute Summoned.
*   If the target is a DARK Monster Card when banished, inflict 1000 Points of damage.
    *   Your opponent CAN use "Gorz, the Emissary of Darkness"'s effect in response to the Effect Damage which was inflicted AFTER their only card (a DARK monster) was banished.  
    *   DO NOT inflict damage if the monster is not DARK when banished by this effect.  
        *   Examples include Token Monsters, Trap Monster, Monsters who are only DARK while face-up on the field (ex: "Light and Darkness Dragon").  
            
    *   DO NOT inflict damage if the DARK Monster is banished by a Condition instead.  
        *   Examples include "Battle Fader", and "Plaguespreader Zombie".  
            
    *   DO inflict damage when a DARK Monster equipped to "Relinquished" is removed from play.  
    *   The target must remain on the field in order to be removed from play by this effect.
*   You CAN Tribute Summon Caius while "Imperial iron Wall" is active.
    *   This effect STILL activates while "Imperial Iron Wall" is active (starting a chain). A target it declared, but no cards can be removed from play while "Imperial Iron Wall"'s effect applies.
*   "[Monarch](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Monarch)"'s Trigger Effects are Spell Speed 1 and activate at the time they are successfully Tribute Summoned. If the opponent wants to activate a card like "[Bottomless Trap Hole](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Bottomless_Trap_Hole)", it will be placed onto the chain after the "[Monarch](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Monarch)"'s effect. But "[Monarchs](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Monarch)" don't need to remain on the field to resolve their effects, so destroying them with "[Bottomless Trap Hole](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Bottomless_Trap_Hole)" will not negate their effect.

  
## CALL OF THE HAUNTED  
> Select 1 monster from your Graveyard and Special Summon it in face-up Attack Position. When this card is removed from the field, destroy that monster. When that monster is destroyed, destroy this card.

*   This effect targets a monster in the Graveyard, and continues to target it while it is face-up on the field.
*   If the monster Special Summoned with "Call of the Haunted" is returned to its owner's hand by an effect, "Call of the Haunted" remains on the field meaninglessly.
*   If an effect is chained that removes this card from the field, the target is not Special Summoned.  
    
*   If "Royal Decree" is activated after "Call of the Haunted" has resolved, and later "Royal Decree" is destroyed, "Call of the Haunted" continues to target the Special Summoned monster.

  
## CALL OF THE MUMMY

*   When you activate the effect of "Call of the Mummy", you can Special Summon a high-level monster from your hand like "Giant Axe Mummy" or "Vampire Lord", but not a Special Summon-only monster like "Fushioh Richie".
*   You can only activate "Call of the Mummy"’s effect during your Main Phase.
*   You select a monster from your hand when you resolve "Call of the Mummy"’s effect, not when you activate the effect.
*   If you have multiple copies of "Call of the Mummy" in play, you can only Special Summon 1 Zombie because when you try to activate the second "Call of the Mummy", you now have a monster on your side of the field so its effect does not apply.

  
## CALL OF THE REAPER

*   You cannot activate this card during the Damage Step. It targets either “Supay” or “Fire Ant Ascator.”

  
## CALMING MAGIC

*   While “Calming Magic” is active, if an effect like “Giant Germ” triggers, you inflict damage but do not Special Summon.

  
## CARD BLOCKER

*   The effect to increase the DEF of “Card Blocker” can be activated when the attack target is changed by “Card Blocker’s” own effect. The effect to change the attack target does not target. If you have multiple copies of “Card Blocker” on the field, you can only activate 1 of their effects to change the attack target when your opponent’s monster attacks. Sending up to 3 cards to the Graveyard is a cost.

  
## CARD DESTRUCTION

*   Discarding your hand is not a cost for either player.
*   "Card Destruction" can be activated if either player has at least 1 card in his/her hand (not including "Card Destruction"). If your opponent has 1 or more cards in his/her hand and you only have "Card Destruction" in your hand, you can activate "Card Destruction". If your opponent has no cards in his/her hand and you have "Card Destruction" and 1 other card in your hand, you can activate "Card Destruction". If your opponent has no cards in his/her hand and you only have "Card Destruction" in your hand, you cannot activate "Card Destruction".

  
## CARD GUARD  
> ① When this card is Normal or Special Summoned, place 1 "Guard Counter" on it. ② This card gains 300 ATK for each Guard Counter it has. ③ Once per turn, you can remove 1 "Guard Counter" from this card and place it on 1 other face-up card you control.

    *   It does not prevent cards from being destroyed by unpaid maintenance costs (ex: "Mirror Wall").
    *   It does not prevent cards from destorying themselves by Continuous / Continuous-like Effects (ex: "Giant Kozaky", "Different Dimension Capsule", "Call of the Haunted").
    *   This Condition applies even if "Card Guard" leaves the field.
    *   "Guard Counters" disappear if the monster is flipped face-down / leaves the field.

## CARD OF SAFE RETURN

*   If the Special Summon is negated with "Horn of Heaven" or "Solemn Judgment" you do not get to draw a card.
*   Drawing a card for this card’s effect is optional, so if you use "Call of the Haunted" when you have no cards left in your Deck you do not lose the Duel.

  
## CARD OF SANCTITY

*   Removing all cards in your hand and your side of the field from play is a cost to activate “Card of Sanctity”. If you have no other cards except for “Card of Sanctity”, you cannot activate it. You must have at least 1 other card on your side of the field or in your hand.
*   You can chain “Null and Void” to “Card of Sanctity”.

## CARD TROOPER  
> ① Once per turn, you can send up to 3 cards from the top of your Deck to the Graveyard. This card gains 500 ATK for each card sent to the Graveyard until the End Phase. ② When this card you control is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, draw 1 card.The ② mandatory Trigger Effect only activates if "Card Trooper" is destroyed while on your side of the field.

*   The ① Ignition Effect sends up to 3 cards from the top of your Deck to the Graveyard AS COST.
    *   This effect CANNOT be activated if "Dimension Fortress Weapon" is face-up on the field.
    *   This effect CANNOT be activated while "Dimensional Fissure" / "Macro Cosmos" is active.
    *   The ATK gained by this effect disappears if "Card Trooper" ceases to be face-up or has its effect negated (by "Skill Drain").
*   If "Card Trooper"'s first effect is activated, and it is flipped face-down then face-up again, the increase in ATK is no longer applied. The effect can be activated again.
*   If "Skill Drain" is activated after "Card Trooper"'s first effect has been activated, the increase in ATK will be negated. Even if "Skill Drain" leaves play, the increase in ATK will not return.
*   The ② Trigger Effect activates in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect activates even if "Card Trooper" was treated as an Equip Card on your side of the field.

## CARDS OF CONSONANCE

*   Discarding is a cost to activate “Cards of Consonance.”

  
## CASTLE GATE

*   If you use "Shield & Sword" to switch the original ATK and DEF of a monster and then Tribute it with "Castle Gate", the damage inflicted will be equal to the monster's unaltered original ATK. For example, if you use "Shield & Sword" to switch the original ATK and DEF of "Mystic Tomato" and then Tribute it with "Castle Gate", you will inflict 1400 damage to your opponent's Life Points.
*   You can Tribute a monster whose Level is reduced to 5 or less by a card effect.
*   If you Normal Summon "Fusilier Dragon, the Dual-Mode Beast" without Tributes and reduce its Level to 5 or less with a card effect, when you Tribute it with "Castle Gate" you will inflict 2800 damage to your opponent's Life Points ("Fusilier Dragon, the Dual-Mode Beast"'s original ATK).
*   When you Tribute a monster with a printed ATK value of "?", no damage is inflicted to your opponent's Life Points.

  
## CASTLE WALLS

*   You choose the monster to receive the DEF increase when you activate this card. This card targets.
*   If you activate two "Castle Walls" on the same monster, its DEF increases by 1000.

  
## CATAPULT TURTLE  
> ① You can Tribute 1 monster to inflict damage equal to half of its ATK to your opponent.

*   Tributing 1 monster is cost for this Ignition Effect.
*   If a face-up monster is tributed, inflict damage equal to half its ATK while face-up on the field.
    *   Example: "Millennium Shield" (ATK 0/DEF 3000) has its ATK and DEF switched by "Shield & Sword". When "Catapult Turtle" Tributes "Millennium Shield" (ATK 3000/DEF 0), it inflicts 1500 damage.
*   If a face-down monster is tributed, inflict damage equal to half its original (printed) ATK in the Graveyard.

  
## CATNIPPED KITTY

*   The first effect of “Catnipped Kitty” is a Continuous Effect and the second is an Ignition Effect.
*   You cannot target a face-down monster with the effect of “Catnipped Kitty”.
*   If you control 2 copies of “Catnipped Kitty” on the field, and no other monsters, your opponent cannot attack, except with monsters that have an effect which allows them to attack directly.

  
## CATOBLEPAS AND THE WITCH OF FATE

*   You cannot activate this effect during the Damage Step.
*   Removing from play 1 monster with ? is a cost.
*   This effect does not target.
*   If multiple monsters are Special Summoned at the same time, including "Catoblepas and the Witch of Fate", you can activate its effect to destroy all your opponent's monsters that were Special Summoned at the same time.
*   If you activate "The Shallow Grave" while you control "Catoblepas and the Witch of Fate" you can activate its effect to destroy the monster your opponent Special Summons.

  
## CAVE DRAGON

*   If you have 2 copies of "Cave Dragon" on the field, they can both attack.
*   You can still Set, Flip Summon, and Special Summon "Cave Dragon" if there is another monster on your side of the field.

  
## CEASEFIRE

*   "Ceasefire" can be activated if there is at least 1 face-down Defense Position monster and/or at least 1 face-up Effect Monster.
*   Monsters flipped by "Ceasefire" are not Flip Summoned, so the effect of "Mysterious Puppeteer" does not activate.
*   If you chain "Ceasefire" to the Flip Effect of a monster, the Flip Effect is not negated.
*   If "Jinzo" is flipped by "Ceasefire", the damage from "Ceasefire"'s effect is still inflicted.
*   Monster Tokens and monsters being treated as Equip Cards are not counted as Effect Monsters.

  
## CELESTIA, LIGHTSWORN ANGEL  
> ① When you Tribute Summon this card by Tributing a "Lightsworn" monster, you can send the top 4 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard to destroy up to 2 cards your opponent controls.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect only activates if the Tribute Material is a "Lightsworn" monster.
    *   This effect activates even if the Tributed "Lightsworn" monster was face-down.
*   Sending the top 4 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   This effect cannot be activated while "Macro Cosmos", etc. is active.
*   This effect targets. You must choose 1 or 2 of your opponent's cards to destroy.
    *   If only 1 card is targeted, your opponent CANNOT chain "Starlight Road" in response.
    *   If 2 cards are targeted, your opponent CAN chain "Starlight Road" in response.

  
## CELESTIAL TRANSFORMATION

*   If the monster Special Summoned with “Celestial Transformation” is flipped face-down, then it is not destroyed during the End Phase.
*   You can activate “Torrential Tribute” after a monster is Special Summoned with the effect of “Celestial Transformation”.
*   You can activate “Inferno Reckless Summon” if the Fairy Special Summoned by the effect of “Celestial Transformation” has 1500 ATK or less after it is halved.
*   If you Special Summon “The Agent of Force – Mars”, its ATK will still be halved and it will be destroyed during the End Phase. It is affected because it was not yet on the field when “Celestial Transformation” resolved.

  
## CEMETERY BOMB

*   The damage inflicted by "Cemetery Bomb" is based on the number of cards in the Graveyard when "Cemetery Bomb" resolves, not when it activates.

  
## CENTRIFUGAL FIELD

*   Only the owner of the Fusion Monster that was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by a card effect can Special Summon a Fusion Material Monster written on the Fusion Monster Card. However, this effect can be used by both players (when their Fusion Monsters are destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by a card effect).
*   If both players have Fusion Monsters destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by card effects at the same time, each of them can Special Summon a Fusion Material Monster. However, when multiple Fusion Monsters controlled by the same player are destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by a card effect, that player can only select and Special Summon 1 Fusion Material Monster.
*   Unlike “De-Fusion”, the Fusion Material Monsters Special Summoned with “Centrifugal Field” do not have to have been used to Fusion Summon the Fusion Monster. In fact, that Fusion Monster does not have to have been properly Fusion Summoned at all (it could have been Special Summoned with “Magical Scientist” or “Summoner of Illusions” instead).
*   Substitute Fusion Material Monsters like “King of the Swamp” cannot be Special Summoned with “Centrifugal Field” because they are not written on the Fusion Monster Card. However, if they were used as substitutes to Fusion Summon the Fusion Monster, you can still use “Centrifugal Field” to Special Summon the other Fusion Material monster from the Fusion Summon.
*   You can chain to the activation of the effect of “Centrifugal Field”.

  
## CESTUS OF DAGLA

*   When "Airknight Parshath" equipped with "Cestus of Dagla" inflicts damage to your opponent's Life Points, the simultaneous effects go on a chain, so the controller decides which effect is resolved first.
*   If you have multiple copies of "Cestus of Dagla" equipped to your monster, the effects accumulate.
*   When your opponent takes control of your Fairy-Type monster equipped with your "Cestus of Dagla", and your opponent uses the monster to damage your Life Points, neither player increases their Life Points. This is because the controller of "Cestus of Dagla" is still you, and "Cestus of Dagla"'s effect only activates when the equipped monster inflicts damage to your opponent's Life Points. Likewise, if you equip "Cestus of Dagla" to your opponent's Fairy-Type monster, neither player will gain any Life Points from "Cestus of Dagla".

  
## CHAIN DESTRUCTION

*   You can activate "Chain Destruction" when you or your opponent Summons the monster.
*   If you activate "Chain Destruction" when a Fusion Monster is Summoned, monsters in the Extra Deck with the same name as the Summoned monster are destroyed.
*   "Chain Destruction" targets the Summoned monster.
*   If an effect is chained that increases the Summoned monster's ATK above 2000 or removes it from the field, "Chain Destruction"'s effect is still applied.

  
## CHAIN DISAPPEARANCE  
> You can only activate this card when a monster(s) with an ATK of 1000 or less is Normal Summoned, Flip Summoned or Special Summoned. Remove from play those Summoned monster(s), and your opponent removes from play all cards of the same name in their hand and Deck. Their Deck is then shuffled.

*   This card activates in the Summon response timing (like "Trap Hole").
    *   This card cannot be activated if a monster was Normal / Special Summoned as Chain Link 2+.
    *   You can activate "Chain Disappearance" in response to your own Summon of a monster. In which case, your opponent still removes all cards with that name from their hand and Deck.
    *   A Flip Summon that triggers a Flip / Trigger Effect will be Chain Link 1, this card be Chain Link 2.
    *   This effect does not target. It can remove multiple monsters Summoned simultaneously.
        *   Example: "Chain Disappearance" will remove all 4 "Sheep Tokens" Summoned by "Scapegoat".
    *   If "Chain Disappearance" is unable to remove from play the monster(s) because it was flipped face-down / removed from the field, your opponent does not banish any cards from their hand / Deck.
    *   If a Fusion / Synchro Monster is removed from play, remove from play any copies in the Extra Deck.
*   If this card destroys a Monster, your must briefly reveal their Deck to verify that all copies of the Monster Card within the Deck have been removed from play \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=822229), [REF2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=960621)\].
    *   This cannot take place when using online duel simulators, as viewing your opponent's would allow an opportunity for foul play (via screen captures).

  
## CHAIN ENERGY

*   "Chain Energy" applies only to cards played or Set from your hand, not cards that are activated when already Set on the field, or to cards placed onto the field by effects like "Cyber Jar"’s Flip Effect.

  
## CHAIN MATERIAL  
\[EFFECT\] _Any time you Fusion Summon a monster this turn, you can remove from play, from your side of the field, Deck, hand or Graveyard, Fusion Material Monsters that are listed on the Fusion Monster Card, and use them as Fusion Material Monsters._ \[CONDITION\] _You cannot attack during the turn this card is activated._ \[CONDITION\] _If you used this effect for a Fusion Summon, the Summoned Fusion Monster(s) is destroyed during the End Phase._  
  

*   When you Fusion Summon after activating "Chain Material", you do not have to use its effect.
*   You cannot use "Chain Material"'s effect when resolving "Instant Fusion" or "Future Fusion".
*   You can use "Chain Material"'s effect when resolving "Super Polymerization", but you can only remove from play cards that you control.
*   The effect of "Chain Material" can be used for every Fusion Summon performed during the turn it is activated.
*   You cannot choose to remove 1 Fusion Material Monster from play while sending the other Fusion Material Monsters to the Graveyard.
*   Both \[CONDITION\] apply if this card's effect is negated (by "Trap Stun"), but not if this card's activation is negated (by "Dark Bribe").

  
## CHAIN STRIKE

*   You can activate a second “Chain Strike” if 1 “Chain Strike” is already on that chain. However, no further “Chain Strikes” can be activated in that same chain after that.

  
## CHAIN SUMMONING

*   If "Chain Summoning" and "Double Summon" are activated during the same turn, you still can only Normal Summon or Set up to 3 times.
*   Normal Summoning or Setting a monster with "Ultimate Offering" does not use one of the three Normal Summons or Sets allowed by "Chain Summoning".

  
## CHAIN THRASHER

*   When this card makes an additional attack, the opponent can activate “Disappear” to remove the other “Chain Thrasher” from the Graveyard, and the attack stops. Do not proceed to the Damage Step.
*   If you have 1 “Chain Thrasher” in the Graveyard and 1 on the field equipped with “Twin Swords of Flashing Light – Tryce”, its still only gets 2 attacks.

  
## CHAINSAW INSECT

*   This card’s effect is a Trigger Effect that activates at the end of the Damage Step.
*   If “Chainsaw Insect” battles, your opponent draws 1 card even if “Chainsaw Insect” is destroyed as a result of the battle, or is removed from the field before the end of the Damage Step (for example, by the effect of “Man-Eater Bug” or “Begone, Knave!”).
*   If the opponent controls your “Chainsaw Insect” and it is destroyed as a result of battle, it will be sent to your Graveyard before the end of the Damage Step and its effect will activate there. So when its effect activates, since it is in your Graveyard, your opponent (who controlled it during the battle) will draw the 1 card.
*   If your face-down “Chainsaw Insect” is attacked, its effect will still activate.
*   If your Defense Position “Chainsaw Insect” is attacked by “Drillroid”, damage calculation is not conducted, so “Chainsaw Insect” did not “battle” and its effect will not activate.
*   If “Skill Drain” is active, your opponent will not get to draw, unless “Chainsaw Insect” is destroyed in the battle, then its effect will activate in the Graveyard and your opponent will draw 1 card.

  
## CHANGE OF HEART

*   You gain control of the targeted monster in the same Battle Position that it was in on your opponent’s side of the field. If it is face-down you may Flip Summon it and any Flip Effect is activated. During your End Phase it is returned to your opponent’s side of the field in the same Battle Position as you last had it in. So if you attacked with the monster and it remained in Attack Position, it will return to your opponent in Attack Position.
*   You can use the monster you control through the effect of "Change of Heart" as a Tribute for a Tribute Summon, or for an effect like "Cannon Soldier’s".

  
## CHANGING DESTINY

*   This targets the opponent’s attacking monster.
*   If you can’t change your opponent’s monster to Defense Position, you can’t apply the rest of the effect.
*   If “Total Defense Shogun” attacks while in Defense Position, you can activate “Changing Destiny.”
    *   The attack will be negated, but the rest of the effect will not be applied. Changing the monster to Defense Position and gaining Life Points or inflicting damage do not happen at the same time.
*   Your opponent chooses which effect to apply after their monster is changed to Defense Position.

  
## CHAOS COMMAND MAGICIAN

*   "Chaos Command Magician" must be face-up to negate a monster effect; if face-down then "Chaos Command Magician" will not negate any effects.
*   When "Chaos Command Magician" is targeted by a card that doesn't select only 1 target, the effect of "Chaos Command Magician" is NOT applied and the effect resolves as normal.
*   When "Penguin Soldier" targets 2 monsters, including "Chaos Command Magician", this is an effect targets, but not one that select "1 target". So "Chaos Command Magician" will not negate the effect of "Penguin Soldier". However, if "Penguin Soldier" only targets "Chaos Command Magician", then it is an effect that selects "1 target" so "Chaos Command Magician" WILL negate the effect of "Penguin Soldier".
*   Vs. "Dark Cat With White Tail", that effect selects 3 targets so "Chaos Command Magician" will not negate "Dark Cat With White Tail"'s effect.
*   If "Chaos Command Magician" is targeted by "Dark Necrofear", that effect selects 1 target so the effect of "Dark Necrofear" is negated and it is not equipped to "Chaos Command Magician".
*   When "Chaos Command Magician" battles "D. D. Warrior Lady", her effect is NOT negated because it does not target.
*   You can activate the effect of "Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite" and target "Chaos Command Magician", but "Chaos Command Magician" will negate the effect and "Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite" will remain on the field as a monster.

  
## CHAOS EMPEROR DRAGON - ENVOY OF THE END

*   "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End" sends itself to the Graveyard as part of its effect, and counts itself for determining how much damage it inflicts.
*   The damage that "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End" inflicts is equal to the number of cards BOTH players send to the Graveyard times 300 points.
*   "Barrel Behind the Door" and "Trap of Board Eraser" can be chained to "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End"'s effect. "Barrel Behind the Door" is, itself, sent to the Graveyard by "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End"'s effect and counts for an additional 300 points as a result.
*   If "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End" is destroyed or removed from play by an effect chained to its own effect, its effect still resolves.
*   Tokens will be removed from the field by "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End"'s effect, but will not add to the damage total because they are not sent to the Graveyard.
*   It is the controller, not the owner, of "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End" that can activate its effect and that inflicts damage to his/her opponent.
*   If you control your opponent's "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End" and you pay the 1000 Life Points, the effect inflicts damage to your opponent even though the monster returns to your opponent's Graveyard.
*   If "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End" is Special Summoned, and the controller immediately activates its effect, and the opponent chains "Torrential Tribute" as Step 2 of a chain, "Torrential Tribute" destroys all monsters on the field and sends them to the Graveyard, then "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End"'s effect resolves, sends all Spell & Trap Cards on the field to the Graveyard, and inflicts 300 points of damage to the opponent for each Spell & Trap Card sent to the Graveyard by its effect. (Monster Cards do not count toward the damage because they were destroyed and sent to the Graveyard in the middle of the chain by "Torrential Tribute".)
*   If "Waboku" is chained to the effect of "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End", it will not prevent the damage because "Waboku" only applies to Battle Damage. Also, "Waboku" will still be on the field when "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End"'s effect is applied, so it will still count for 300 points of damage to the opponent.
*   When "Minar" and "Electric Snake" are sent to the Graveyard by "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End", their effects are not activated because the modified text on those cards says when they are "discarded to the Graveyard from the hand".

  
## CHAOS NECROMANCER

*   If you equip "Chaos Necromancer" with "Axe of Despair" and have 5 monsters in your Graveyard, the ATK of "Chaos Necromancer" is 2500 (1500 + 1000).
*   If "Chaos Necromancer" is equipped with "Megamorph", its ATK is zero, but if "Megamorph" leaves play, recalculate the ATK of "Chaos Necromancer" using his effect.
*   If "Shield & Sword" is activated, it reverses the original ATK & DEF of "Chaos Necromancer", which are both zero, then "Chaos Necromancer"'s effect is applied and his ATK will be 300 x the number of monsters in your Graveyard, and DEF zero.

  
## CHAOS SORCERER  
> This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set. Ⓢ This card can only be Special Summoned by removing from play 1 LIGHT and 1 DARK monster in your Graveyard. ① Once per turn, during your Main Phase, you can remove from play 1 face-up monster on the field.

## CHAOSRIDER GUSTAPH

*   You can only activate "Chaosrider Gustaph"'s effect during your Main Phase 1 or 2.
*   "Chaosrider Gustaph"'s effect does not target.

  
## CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE  
> Send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard. Add 1 Level 4 or lower "Lightsworn" monster from your Deck to your hand.

*   Sending 3 cards from the top of your Deck to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   Charge cannot be activated while "Dimensional Fissure" / "Macro Cosmos" is active.
*   If the last Level 4 or lower "Lightsworn" in your Deck is sent to the Graveyard as cost, briefly show your Deck to your opponent to verify that no Level 4 or lower "Lightsworn" monsters remain in your Deck.
*   You cannot activate this card if you have 3 or less cards in your Deck.
*   Charge does not target the "Lightsworn" in Deck, it can activate with "[Aurkus, Lightsworn Druid](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Aurkus,_Lightsworn_Druid)" face-up.

  
## CHARM OF SHABTI

*   You can activate the effect of "Charm of Shabti" during the Damage Step.
*   "Charm of Shabti" is like a reverse-"Kuriboh": you take damage from the attack as normal, but your monster is unharmed.

  
## CHECKMATE

*   "Checkmate" targets 1 "Terrorking Archfiend" on your side of the field as a target when it is activated.

  
## CHIMERA THE FLYING MYTHICAL BEAST

*   If “Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast” is destroyed by “Cyber Jar” you will miss the timing to activate its effect.
*   If more copies of “Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast” are destroyed while in your Extra Deck by “Chain Destruction” you can activate their effects and Summon “Berfomet” or “Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts.”
*   If “Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast” is destroyed by “Dark Ruler Ha Des” or another Fiend-Type monster you control while “Dark Ruler Ha Des” is on the field, its effect to Special Summon is negated.
*   If “Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast” is destroyed while equipped to “Relinquished” you can activate its effect.
*   You can activate the effect if “Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast” is destroyed by a card effect or by battle.
*   If your opponent controls your “Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast” and it is destroyed, you get to activate the effect.

  
## CHIMERATECH FORTRESS DRAGON  
> “Cyber Dragon” + 1 or more Machine-Type monsters_  
_Ⓒ This monster cannot be used as a Fusion Material monster. Ⓢ You can only Special Summon this card from your Extra Deck by sending the above cards from either side of the field to the Graveyard. (You do not use “Polymerization”.) ① The original ATK of this card is equal to 1000 x the number of Fusion Material Monsters used to Special Summon it.

*   The Ⓒ Condition is not an effect. It cannot be negated by "Skill Drain".
*   This Ⓢ Special Summon does not start a chain.
    *   Once properly Special Summoned, this card can be Special Summoned by "Call of the Haunted".
    *   This card CANNOT be Special Summoned while "Vanity’s Fiend"'s effect applies, even if "Vanity's Fiend" is a Machine-Type (by "DNA Surgery").
    *   This card CANNOT be Special Summoned while "Dimensional Fissure" prevents monsters from being sent to the Graveyard.
    *   This card CAN be Special Summoned by sending face-down Fusion Material Monsters you control.
    *   This card CAN be Special Summoned by sending to the Graveyard a face-up "Cyber Dragon" that is equipped to "Relinquished" (since its name is specifically listed).
    *   This card CANNOT be Special Summoned by sending to the Graveyard a Machine-Type monster(s) equipped to "Relinquished" (since monsters being treated as Equip Spell Cards do not have Types).
*   The ① Continuous Effect determines this card's ATK.
    *   If "Skill Drain" is active, this card's ATK becomes "0" (even if "Skill Drain" is negated / destroyed).
    *   If this card is flipped face-down / leaves the field, its ATK becomes 0 when it is face-up again.

  
## CHIMERATECH OVERDRAGON

*   When you Fusion Summon this card you can use a substitute, such as “King of the Swamp”, for the “Cyber Dragon”, but not for the Machine-Type monsters. That means you can use a maximum of 1 substitute monster in the Fusion Summon.
*   The effect that sends all your other cards to the Graveyard is a Trigger Effect and it can be chained to.
*   “Chimeratech Overdragon” can attack the same monster more than once if the attack target is not destroyed, such as an Attack Position “Spirit Reaper”.
*   If “Chimeratech Overdragon” attacks directly, and then the opponent Special Summons a monster during the same Battle Phase it cannot attack it.
*   You can activate “De-Fusion” and target “Chimeratech Overdragon”, but you can only Special Summon the Fusion Material Monsters if you have enough vacant Monster Card Zones for ALL of the Fusion Material Monsters you used.
*   If this card is Special Summoned by the effect of "Future Fusion" while you have "Cyber Phoenix" in Attack Position, when this card's effect sends all other cards you control to the Graveyard "Future Fusion" is still being negated, so the "Chimeratech Overdragon" will not be destroyed and remains on the field.

  
## CHIRON THE MAGE

*   Discarding 1 Spell Card is a cost to activate this effect.
*   If you activate the effect of “Chiron the Mage”, then flip it face-down, then flip it face-up all in the same turn, you can activate its effect again.
*   The restriction that you can only activate this effect once per turn is a condition, not an effect. So if “Skill Drain” is on the field, you can pay the cost once per turn (for no effect), but not pay the cost continuously in the same turn.

  
## CHOPMAN THE DESPERATE OUTLAW

*   You choose an Equip Spell Card when "Chopman the Desperate Outlaw"'s effect activates, so your opponent can chain "Disappear" and remove it from play, and "Chopman the Desperate Outlaw"'s effect will disappear.
*   You cannot select an inappropriate Equip Spell Card with "Chopman the Desperate Outlaw''s effect, like "Fuhma Shuriken".
*   If you equip "Chopman the Desperate Outlaw" with an inappropriate Equip Spell Card and later notice it is inappropriate, destroy the Equip Spell Card.
*   You cannot choose "Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite" with "Chopman the Desperate Outlaw"'s effect.
*   "Curse of Darkness" does not apply when you use "Chopman the Desperate Outlaw"'s effect because the Equip Spell Card is not being activated.

  
## CHOSEN ONE

*   You may not select a monster that can only be Special Summoned by a specific effect for this card’s effect, such as a Ritual Monster, "Chaos Emperor Dragon – Envoy of the End" or "Spirit of the Pharaoh". If the only Monster Card in your hand is a monster such as these, then you cannot activate "Chosen One".
*   If you activate "Chosen One" and your opponent chains "Lightforce Sword" to remove 1 of the 3 chosen cards from your hand, the effect of "Chosen One" cannot resolve and disappears.

  
## CHRYSALIS DOLPHIN

*   If you activate this effect and find that you do not have “Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin” in your hand or Deck your opponent can check both to verify.
*   If you Tribute “Chrysalis Dolphin” and your opponent chains an effect to destroy “Neo Space”, then the effect of “Chrysalis Dolphin” does not resolve.

  
## CHTHONIAN ALLIANCE

*   The monster equipped with this card does not count towards the bonus. So if you have 2 “Dark Magicians” on the field, and 1 is equipped with “Chthonian Alliance”, it has +800 ATK.
*   Monsters on the opponent’s side of the field are counted for “Chthonian Alliance”.
*   Monsters that are treated as having the same name, like “Cyber Harpie Lady” and “Harpie Lady 3”, both count as “Harpie Lady” for purposes of “Chthonian Alliance”.

  
## CHTHONIAN BLAST

*   This effect does not target.
*   This card can be activated during the Damage Step if a monster is destroyed as a result of battle. However, it cannot be activated if a monster is destroyed by an effect during the Damage Step.
*   You cannot activate this card if your face-up monster is destroyed in the middle of a chain.
*   You can activate 2 copies of “Chthonian Blast” when 1 of your face-up monsters is destroyed, and since it does not target, the 2nd one will resolve and destroy the monster with the lowest ATK and inflict damage, and then the 1st one will resolve and destroy the monster with the next lowest ATK and inflict damage.
*   You can chain “Barrel Behind the Door” to “Chthonian Blast”.

  
## CHTHONIAN POLYMER

*   Tributing 1 monster is a cost to activate “Chthonian Polymer”.
*   You can only activate this card when the opponent Fusion Summons a monster, including with a Special Summon that is treated as a Fusion Summon, like “Miracle Fusion” or “Power Bond”. You cannot activate it when they Special Summon a Fusion Monster with a card effect, like “Metamorphosis” or “Cyber-Stein”.
*   You gain control of the Fusion Monster for as long as it remains on the field.

  
## CHTHONIAN SOLDIER

*   The damage dealt by this card’s effect is Effect Damage, not Battle Damage.
*   This card’s effect is a Trigger Effect. It activates in the Graveyard.
*   If the opponent takes control of your “Chthonian Soldier” with “Snatch Steal” and you attack it next turn, its effect will not activate because when it is sent to your Graveyard, it was not your opponent’s monster that attacked it.

  
## CLEAR VICE DRAGON  
> ① You are unaffected by the effects of "Clear World". ② If this card attacks an opponent's monster, the ATK of this card becomes twice the ATK of the attack target, during damage calculation only. ③ If this card would be destroyed by an opponent's card effect, you can discard 1 card instead.

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   VS. "[Clear World"](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Card_Rulings:Clear_World): If you control "Clear Vice Dragon" and any EARTH, FIRE, or WATER monsters, the effect of "Clear World" will start a Chain but it will resolve without effect.
*   The ② Continuous Effect begins to apply during Substep 1 - Start of the Damage Step.
    *   If an opponent activates the effect of “Honest” when “Clear Vice Dragon” battles their LIGHT monster, “Clear Vice Dragon’s” ATK will become twice the boosted ATK of the opponent’s monster.
    *   If this card attacks “The Wicked Avatar” its ATK will become double that of “The Wicked Avatar” then “The Wicked Avatar” would become this card’s ATK plus 100. No further change will occur.
*   The ③ Continuous Effect applies while resolving an opponent's effect that would destroy this card.
    *   Discarding a card is an effect, not a cost (this can trigger the effects of “Dark World” monsters).
    *   You choose which card you want to discard to prevent this card’s destruction.
    *   This effect only substitutes this card's destruction. It does not negate the opponent's card effect.
    *   If your opponent's Monster’s effect would destroy this card and you Chain an effect to take control of that monster, you can still discard 1 card to prevent this card's destruction.

  
## CLEAR WORLD

*   If you control a monster with an effect that treats it as having multiple Attributes, all the relevant effects of “Clear World” will apply to you.
*   Even if “Field Barrier” is active, if you don’t pay the cost of “Clear World” during the End Phase it will be destroyed.
*   You still have to pay 500 Life Points to activate Spell Cards if you control a WIND monster, even if you also control “Spell Economics.” The WIND effect of “Clear World” only applies to activating Spell Cards. You do not pay Life Points when you activate the effect of a Spell Card that is already face-up on the field.
*   If you control “Clear Vice Dragon” and any EARTH, FIRE, or WATER monsters, the effect of “Clear World” will still start a Chain but it will resolve without effect.
*   The EARTH, FIRE, and WATER effects of “Clear World” each start their own Chain. You do not form a single Chain with all 3 effects.
*   The LIGHT, DARK, and WIND effects of “Clear World” do not start a Chain.

  
## CLIFF THE TRAP REMOVER

*   You cannot choose an effect that cannot be performed (such as choosing to destroy a Spell or Trap Card when there are none on the field).

  
## CLOAK AND DAGGER

*   You declare a monster card name when “Cloak and Dagger” resolves.
*   This card’s removal effect starts a Chain.
*   You cannot activate this card during the Damage Step.
*   If this card was already activated and face-up when the declared monster is flipped face-up or Summoned during the Damage Step, this card’s effect will activate at the same time as a Flip Effect (after Damage Calculation).
*   This card must be face-up and active on the field before the declared monster is Summoned or flipped face-up. If you Chain this card’s activation to the effect of a monster that activates when that monster is Summoned or flipped face-up and declare that monster’s name, it will not be removed from play.
*   If “Cloak and Dagger” is face-up and active, and the declared monster is Summoned or flipped face-up during resolution of a Chain, it will be removed from play after resolving all effects on that Chain.
*   If multiple copies of the declared monster are Summoned at the same time, they will all be removed from play.
*   If “Ring of Destruction”, etc. is Chained to the effect of “Cloak and Dagger” to destroy the monster that was Summoned or flipped face-up, “Cloak and Dagger” will still remove itself from play.
*   If multiple copies of the declared monster are Summoned by effects on different Links of the same Chain, only the first one Summoned (the one Summoned at the highest Chain Link) will be removed from play. For example, if 2 copies of “Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World” are discarded at the same time, only 1 is removed from play.
*   If your opponent already controls a copy of the declared monster, then Summons another copy, only the newly Summoned monster will be removed from play.
*   If you Special Summon the monster declared by “Cloak and Dagger”, you can Chain “Inferno Reckless Summon” to the effect of “Cloak and Dagger”. Only the first monster Summoned (the one that triggered the effect of “Cloak and Dagger”) will be removed from play.

  
## CLOCK TOWER PRISON

*   Putting a Clock Counter on “Clock Tower Prison” can be chained to. The effect to Special Summon “Destiny Hero – Dreadmaster” can also be chained to. Even though this effect can be chained to, it cannot be chained to with an effect that negates the activation of a Spell Card, such as “Magic Jammer” or “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8” because the “Clock Tower Prison” card has already resolved.
*   The effect that stops Battle Damage is a Continuous Effect that cannot be chained to.
*   If “Clock Tower Prison” with 4 or more Clock Counters is destroyed because a new Field Spell Card is activated, “Clock Tower Prison’s” effect will activate.
*   If “Spell Canceller” is Summoned or “Imperial Order” is activated, all the Clock Counters will be removed from “Clock Tower Prison”.

  
## CLOUDIAN - ACID CLOUD

*   If “Cloudian – Acid Cloud” is attacked while in face-down Defense Position and it is flipped face-up by the attack, it is destroyed by its effect after damage calculation.

  
## CLOUDIAN - ALTUS

*   If “Cloudian – Altus” is attacked while in face-down Defense Position and it is flipped face-up by the attack, it is destroyed by its effect after damage calculation.

  
## CLOUDIAN - CIRROSTRATUS

*   If “Cloudian – Cirrostratus” is attacked while in face-down Defense Position and it is flipped face-up by the attack, it is destroyed by its effect after damage calculation.

  
## CLOUDIAN - EYE OF THE TYPHOON

*   If “Cloudian – Eye of the Typhoon” is attacked while in face-down Defense Position and it is flipped face-up by the attack, it is destroyed by its effect after damage calculation.

  
## CLOUDIAN - GHOST FOG

*   This effect does not target. You determine how many Fog Counters to place (based on the Level of the monster that destroyed “Cloudian – Ghost Fog” in battle) and you choose which monsters to place the Fog Counters onto when the effect is resolved.
*   If “Skill Drain” is activated while a monster has Fog Counter(s), the Fog Counter(s) remain on the monster.

  
## CLOUDIAN - NIMBUSMAN

*   If “Cloudian – Nimbusman” is attacked while in face-down Defense Position and it is flipped face-up by the attack, it is destroyed by its effect after damage calculation.
*   If you Tribute “Unshaven Angler” to Tribute Summon “Cloudian – Nimbusman”, it will only count as 1 monster so you will only place 1 Fog Counter for Tributing it.
*   If “Cloudian – Nimbusman’s” Level is reduced to 4 or less by another card effect (“A Legendary Ocean”, “Level Conversion Lab,” etc.), you will not be able to Tribute any monsters when it is Normal Summoned because you do not offer Tributes to Normal Summon a Level 4 or lower monster.
*   The effect that allows you to Tribute any number of WATER monsters when Tribute Summoning “Cloudian – Nimbusman” cannot be used when you Tribute to Set “Cloudian – Nimbusman”.
*   If “Cloudian – Nimbusman” is selected for “Rain Storm”, recalculate its ATK after applying the reduction selected for “Rain Storm”. For example, if there are 2 Fog Counters on the field, “Cloudian – Nimbusman” would have 2000 ATK. If you select it with “Rain Storm” and decide to reduce its ATK by 2000, “Cloudian – Nimbusman” would have a total of 0 ATK.
*   If you Tribute a non-WATER monster to Tribute Summon “Cloudian – Nimbusman”, it is not possible to Tribute additional WATER monsters. Tributing additional WATER monsters is only possible when you are only Tributing WATER monsters.

  
## CLOUDIAN - POISON CLOUD

*   “Cloudian – Poison Cloud’s” effect will only inflict 800 damage if its effect successfully destroys the monster that destroyed it in battle. For example, “Vennominaga, the Deity of Poisonous Snakes” is unaffected by other Monster Effects and thus could not be destroyed, so “Cloudian – Poison Cloud” would not inflict damage in this case.

  
## CLOUDIAN - TURBULENCE

*   If “Cloudian – Turbulence” is attacked while in face-down Defense Position and it is flipped face-up by the attack, it is destroyed by its effect after damage calculation.
*   You cannot activate the effect of “Cloudian – Turbulence” that Special Summons “Cloudian – Smoke Ball” if “Cloudian – Smoke Ball” is not in your Deck or in either player’s Graveyard.
*   If you activate “Cloudian – Turbulence’s” effect and an effect is chained that removes all 3 copies of “Cloudian – Smoke Ball” from play, you do not have to show your Deck to your opponent to verify because all 3 copies of “Cloudian – Smoke Ball” are accounted for.

  
## CLOUDIAN SQUALL

*   “Cloudian Squall’s” effect activates during each of your Standby Phases, even if there are no face-up monsters on the field. This effect begins a Chain.

  
## COACH GOBLIN

*   You have to show your opponent the card that you return to the bottom of your Deck.

  
## COBRA JAR

*   When the "Poisonous Snake Token" is destroyed as a result of battle, it is the opponent of "Cobra Jar"'s controller that takes the damage; so even if the opponent had taken control of the "Poisonous Snake Token" with "Change of Heart", he/she still takes the damage when it is destroyed.

  
## COCOON OF EVOLUTION

*   If "Cocoon of Evolution" is Summoned or Set it is treated as a monster, if played as an Equip Spell Card it is treated as an Equip Spell Card as long as it remains on the field and could be destroyed with "Mystical Space Typhoon". Once on the field it cannot be switched from monster to Spell Card or vice versa. "Cocoon of Evolution" is NOT a Union Monster.

  
## COCOON PARTY

*   You cannot activate this card if you have no "Neo-Spacian" monsters in your Graveyard and/or no "Chrysalis" monsters in your Deck.
*   You cannot activate this card if there are fewer "Chrysalis" monsters in your Deck than there are "Neo-Spacian" monsters with different names in your Graveyard.
*   You cannot activate this card if you have fewer open Monster Card Zones than the number of "Neo-Spacian" monsters with different names in your Graveyard.
*   "Neo-Spacian Marine Dolphin" counts as 2 "Neo-Spacian" monsters with different names for this card's effect. If you have 1 "Neo-Spacian Marine Dolphin" in your Graveyard, you can Special Summon 2 "Chrysalis" monsters from your Deck.

  
## COCOON REBIRTH

*   This card's effect is used like an Ignition Effect, and can be activated multiple times.
*   You can Tribute a "Neo-Spacian Dark Panther" that is copying the name and effect of a "Chrysalis" monster for "Cocoon Reborn", but you cannot Special Summon a monster with the effect.

  
## COCOON VEIL

*   You cannot activate this card if you cannot Special Summon a monster due to the effect of "Scapegoat", etc.
*   Tributing a "Chrysalis" monster is part of this card's effect, not a cost.
*   There is no specific activation timing for this card. Any effect damage done to a player after this card resolves is reduced to 0.
*   The damage reduction and Special Summon effects of this card are indepentant of each other. You Special Summon as part of this card's resolution, not the first time damage is reduced to 0 by its effect.
*   You cannot activate this card if a "Neo-Spacian" monster written in the text of a "Chrysalis" monster you can Tribute for its effect is not in your hand, Deck or either Graveyard.

  
## CODARUS  
> ① You can send 1 face-up "Umi" you control to the Graveyard to select up to 2 cards your opponent controls and send them to the Graveyard.

*   The ① Ignition Effect targets.
*   If you gain control of one of the cards targeted by the effect of “Codarus” before it resolves, that card is not sent to the Graveyard. The other one is.
*   If one of the cards targeted by the effect of “Codarus” is no longer on the field when the effect resolves, the other one is still sent to the Graveyard.
*   Sending “Umi” to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   If you control “A Legendary Ocean” and “Forgotten Temple of the Deep” you only need to send 1 of them to the Graveyard to activate this effect.

  
## CODE "A" ANCIENT RUINS  
> ① Each time a face-up "Alien" monster(s) is destroyed, place 1 A-Counter on this card. ② Once per turn, you can remove 2 A-Counters from anywhere on the field to Special Summon 1 "Alien" monster from your Graveyard.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect does not start a chain.
    *   No A-Counter is placed on this card if an "Alien" monster face-down when an attack is declared.
*   The ② Ignition-llike Effect targets an "Alien" monster in your Graveyard.
    *   Removing 2 A-Counters from this card is a cost.
    *   This card must remain face-up on the field in order to resolve this effect.

  
## COFFIN SELLER

*   "Coffin Seller" applies its effect when monster(s) are sent from the hand, Deck, or the field to the Graveyard.
*   If multiple monsters are sent to the Graveyard at the same time (due to "Dark Hole", etc.) then inflict 300 damage only because it is considered as 1 time.
*   Multiple copies of "Coffin Seller" are cumulative.

  
## COLD WAVE  
> This card can only be activated at the start of Main Phase 1. Until your next turn, you and your opponent cannot play or Set and Spell or Trap Cards.

*   While this effect applies \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=10997322&postcount=3)\], players CANNOT:
    *   Set Spell / Trap / Monster (ex: "[Toy Magician](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Toy_Magician)") cards in the Spell / Trap Card Zone;
    *   activate (play face-up) Spell / Trap Cards;
    *   activate the effect of a Normal Spell sent to the Graveyard by "[Destiny Hero Diamond Dude](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Destiny_HERO_-_Diamond_Dude)" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=888786)\];
    *   activate Ignition-like Effects (ex: "[Blaze Accelerator](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Blaze_Accelerator)", "[Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Valhalla,_Hall_of_the_Fallen)");
    *   activate Trigger-like Effects (ex: "[Black Garden](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Black_Garden)", "[Geartown](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Geartown)", "[Dark Coffin](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dark_Coffin)");
    *   nor activate Quick-like Effects (ex: "[Royal Oppression](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Royal_Oppression)", "[Skull Lair](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Skull_Lair)", "[Skill Successor](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Skill_Successor)").
*   Continuous-like Effects are unaffected and will still apply (ex: "[Zombie World](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Zombie_World)", "[Rivalry of Warlords](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Rivalry_of_Warlords)").

  
## COLLECTED POWER

*   If "Kisetai" is moved by the effect of "Collected Power" it is destroyed.
*   Monster Cards equipped to "Sword Hunter" can be moved to another "Sword Hunter", but if they are moved to any other monster they are destroyed.
*   Monster Cards equipped to "Relinquished" or "Thousand-Eyes Restrict" can be moved to another "Relinquished or "Thousand-Eyes Restrict" but if either of these monsters is already equipped with a Monster Card, the new one is destroyed. If these moved to any other monster, the cards are destroyed.
*   You can move "Snatch Steal" with this card’s effect, and it will affect the newly equipped monster (the controller of "Snatch Steal" gains control of it, and loses control of the previously equipped monster).
*   If a "Premature Burial" already equipped to a monster is moved to a new monster by the effect of "Collected Power", both "Premature Burial" and the original monster it was equipped to are destroyed. If you chain "Collected Power" to "Premature Burial", the monster in the Graveyard that was targeted never leaves the Graveyard and "Premature Burial" is destroyed.
*   If multiple Union Monsters are going to be equipped to 1 legal target monster by "Collected Power", you select 1 of them and equip it to the target monster, and the other Union Monster Cards are destroyed.

  
## COLOSSAL FIGHTER  
> ① This card gains 100 ATK for every Warrior-Type monster in any Graveyard. ② When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, you can Special Summon 1 Warrior-Type monster from either player's Graveyard.

*   The ① Continuous Effect re-calculates as the total of Warrior-Type monsters in the Graveyards changes.
    *   This process does not start a chain, even in instances where the ATK gain changes.
    *   VS. "Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind"'s effect is used to halve the ATK of "Collossal Fighter" while he was +400, the ① Continuous Effect ceases to change the ATK and its value becomes locked at the new value (2800 + 400 = 3200; once halved by Gale = 1600 ATK) so long as "Colossal Fighter" remains face-up.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step when "Colossal Fighter" is destroyed by battle and finally sent to the Graveyard.
    *   This is actually an optional effect, the change being clarified in the DL09 print \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?p=13618243#post13618243)\].
    *   This effect targets a Warrior-Type monster in the Graveyard and will be negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   This effect can be used to Special Summon the same "Colossal Fighter" that was destroyed, even if he is the only Warrior-Type monster in the Graveyard(s).
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect WILL NOT ACTIVATE IF:
    *   "Colossal Fighter" was removed from play After Damage Calculation by "D.D. Warrior Lady’s" effect.
    *   "Colossal Fighter" was destroyed After Damage Calculation by the Flip Effect of "Man-Eater Bug".
    *   A Defense Position "Colossal Fighter" was shuffled into the Deck by "Ehren, Lightsworn Monk".

  
## COLOSSEUM - CAGE OF THE GLADIATOR BEASTS

*   The effect that places 1 Counter onto “Colosseum – Cage of the Gladiator Beasts” whenever a monster is Special Summoned from a player’s Deck begins a Chain.
*   Discarding 1 card to prevent “Colosseum – Cage of the Gladiator Beasts” from being destroyed by a card effect does not use the Chain. You discard the 1 card when resolving the effect that should destroy “Colosseum – Cage of the Gladiator Beasts”.

  
## COMBINATION ATTACK

*   This card targets.
*   Both the equipped monster and the Union Monster can attack after "Combination Attack" is used, assuming the Union Monster was Special Summoned in face-up Attack Position.
*   "Combination Attack" can only be used against a monster that reached the Damage Step; if a monster attacks and a replay occurs, then it is not considered to have attacked for purposes of "Combination Attack".
*   You can use this effect on an equipped monster on your opponent's side of the field that has attacked. Your opponent's monster can then attack again as per "Combination Attack"'s effect.
*   You can attack with a Union Monster, use "Formation Union" to equip it to a monster, attack with the equipped monster, activate "Combination Attack" to detach the Union Monster, and attack again with the previously-equipped monster and with the Union Monster.
*   If "Dark Blade", equipped with "Kiryu" and "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce", attacks twice using "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce"'s effect, then you use "Combination Attack" to detach "Kiryu" from "Dark Blade", both monsters can attack again once each. "Dark Blade" cannot attack another 2 times because it has already attacked twice.
*   If the player who would control the Union Monster already has 5 monsters on the field, "Combination Attack" cannot be activated.

  
## COMBO FIGHTER

*   “Combo Fighter” must be face-up on the field when the chain occurs in order to be able to attack twice. If a chain occurs, and then this monster is flipped face-down and then face-up again, it cannot attack twice. (Unless a new chain occured after it was flipped face-up.)
*   If a chain occurred, then “Skill Drain” was activated, but then “Skill Drain” was destroyed, this monster can attack twice. (This monster’s perception that a chain occurred is not reset.)

  
## COMBO MASTER

*   “Combo Master” must be face-up on the field when the chain occurs in order to be able to attack twice. If a chain occurs, and then this monster is flipped face-down and then face-up again, it cannot attack twice. (Unless a new chain occured after it was flipped face-up.)
*   If a chain occurred, then “Skill Drain” was activated, but then “Skill Drain” was destroyed, this monster can attack twice. (This monster’s perception that a chain occurred is not reset.)

  
## COMMAND KNIGHT

*   If you control a "Command Knight" equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", and another monster, your opponent can and must select "Command Knight" as an attack target if he chooses to attack.
*   If you control 2 face-up "Command Knights", and no other monsters, and 1 of them is equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", your opponent cannot attack because the 2 "Command Knights" are preventing an attack from being declared. "Ring of Magnetism"’s effect forcefully leads the attack to the equipped monster only when the opponent declares an attack, which is impossible for your opponent to do.
*   If "Umi" is active and you have "The Legendary Fisherman" on the field, your opponent can attack directly. But if you have "Legendary Fisherman" and "Command Knight", and no other monsters, your opponent cannot attack directly because of "Command Knight", and cannot attack "Command Knight" because of his effect, and cannot attack "The Legendary Fisherman", so he cannot declare an attack (but can enter the Battle Phase to activate card effects).
*   If you control "Patrician of Darkness" and "Command Knight", and your opponent attacks, you cannot choose the "Command Knight" as the attack target.
*   If you control "Command Knight" equipped with "Raregold Armor", your opponent can attack "Command Knight".
*   If you control a "Command Knight" and another monster, and your opponent attacks the other monster, you can use "Shift" to select "Command Knight" as the new attack target.
*   You can choose your own "Command Knight" as the attack target when your opponent attacks your "Dreamsprite".
*   "Command Knight"’s effect increases its own ATK by 400 points, in addition to your other Warrior-Type monsters.
*   If you control multiple "Command Knights", their effects are cumulative so each will increase all of your Warrior-Type monsters' ATK by 400 points.
*   If "Command Knight" is Normal Summoned, Flip summoned, or Special Summoned, its ATK is at least 1600 so your opponent can activate "Bottomless Trap Hole".
*   If "King Tiger Wanghu" is on the field face-up, and "Command Knight" is Summoned, the effect of "Command Knight" is applied immediately because it is a Continuous Effect, so first change "Command Knight"’s ATK to 1600. After that, "King Tiger Wanghu"’s effect cannot activate because "Command Knight"’s ATK is not 1400 or lower.
*   If "Physical Double" creates a Mirage Token of a Warrior-Type monster while "Command Knight" is on the field, take the current ATK (including "Command Knight" Bonus), then apply all bonuses again if appropriate. So a Mirage Token of a 1600 ATK Warrior-Type monster would be ATK 2000 (it copies the 1600 ATK and then gains "Command Knight"’s +400 ATK bonus).

  
## COMPULSORY EVACUATION DEVICE

*   "Compulsory Evacuation Device" targets 1 monster.

  
## CONFUSION CHAFF

*   This card does not target.
*   When "Confusion Chaff" resolves, the battle caused by "Confusion Chaff" proceeds directly to the Damage Step.
*   This card cannot be activated when a single monster like “Hayabusa Knight”, etc., makes its second direct attack in the same Battle Phase.
*   If the first monster that attacked directly is face-down when “Confusion Chaff” resolves, it is flipped face-up and damage calculation is conducted normally.
*   If a monster’s attack becomes a direct attack due to a replay, it is still considered to be the first monster that attacked directly for “Confusion Chaff”.
*   If a monster declares a direct attack, but that attack is negated, it will not be considered the first monster that attacked directly that turn.
*   If your “Amazoness Swords Woman” declares the second direct attack during a Battle Phase, and “Confusion Chaff” is activated, your opponent will take any battle damage from that battle.

  
## CONSCRIPTION

*   Both players get to see the card picked up for “Conscription”.
*   If your Monster Card Zones are full, you can activate “Conscription”, and if you pick up a monster you can Normal Summon, it is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.
*   If you pick up a Spirit Monster, it cannot be Special Summoned so it is added to your opponent’s hand.
*   If you pick up “Rare Metal Dragon” for “Conscription”, it is added to your opponent’s hand.
*   If you cannot Summon because you activated “Scapegoat” or “Stray Lambs” that turn, you cannot activate “Conscription”.
*   You can use “Royal Oppression" to negate the Special Summon of “Conscription”.

  
## CONSECRATED LIGHT

*   You can Summon “Light and Darkness Dragon” while “Consecrated Light” is on the field. Once it is on the field, it will be unable to attack.

  
## CONTACT OUT

*   If you control a “Neos” Fusion Monster that is owned by your opponent and you select it with “Contact Out”, the “Neos” Fusion Monster is returned to its owner’s Extra Deck (your opponent). You will still Special Summon the Fusion Material Monsters from your Deck.
*   “Contact Out” can still be activated when the Fusion Material Monsters written in the text of the “Neos” Fusion Monster are not present in the Deck of the controller of the “Neos” Fusion Monster. In this case the “Neos” Fusion Monster is returned to its owner’s Extra Deck, but no monsters will be Special Summoned.

  
## CONTINUOUS DESTRUCTION PUNCH

*   "Continuous Destruction Punch" is like "Destruction Punch" except it's a Continuous Spell Card that you activate during your Main Phase.
*   A monster destroyed because of "Continuous Destruction Punch" is destroyed by "Continuous Destruction Punch"'s effect, not "as a result of battle".
*   The determination of whether a monster is destroyed by "Continuous Destruction Punch"'s effect happens at Damage Calculation, so Flip Effects, etc., are resolved AFTER "Continuous Destruction Punch"'s effect destroys a monster (but does not yet send it to the Graveyard). Then, after applying Flip Effects, send a monster destroyed by this card (or by Damage Calculation) to the Graveyard.

  
## CONTRACT WITH EXODIA

*   When you activate "Contract with Exodia", and your opponent chains "Disappear" to remove a piece of Exodia from your Graveyard, you still Special Summon "Exodia Necross", but "Exodia Necross" is then destroyed because of its effect.

  
## CONTRACT WITH THE ABYSS

*   "Contract with the Abyss" is used as a generic substitute for Ritual Spell Cards like "Black Illusion Ritual" and "Contract with the Dark Master". You cannot use "Contract with the Abyss" to Ritual Summon a non-Ritual Monster like "Dark Magician".
*   "Cost Down" will not reduce the number of Level Stars needed to perform a Ritual Summon, even if used with "Contract with the Abyss".
*   If you Ritual Summon a Ritual Monster using "Contract with the Abyss", it is considered properly Summoned, so you can use "Monster Reborn" on it afterwards.

  
## CONVERT CONTACT

*   You cannot activate this card if there are no "Neo-Spacian" monsters in your hand or Deck.
*   If an effect chained to this card causes you to have no "Neo-Spacian" cards in your hand or Deck, this card's effect ("Draw 2 cards.") does not resolve.
*   You cannot activate this card if there are 2 or fewer cards in your Deck.

  
## CONVULSION OF NATURE

*   When this card’s effect is active, both Decks are flipped upside down, and now the face of the top card of the Deck is showing.
*   If a card effect requires a player to shuffle their Deck, it is shuffled and cut face-down so the cards are not seen, and then placed face-up in the Deck Zone.
*   If a "Parasite Paracide" is face-up in your Deck before this card is activated, it will become face-down once this card is active. Its effect will still activate when it is drawn.
*   If 2 copies of "Convulsion of Nature" are active, the Decks are still upside-down (they do not revert to normal).

  
## COPY PLANT

*   "Copy Plant"'s effect targets 1 face-up Plant-Type monster on the field.
*   "Copy Plant"'s effect copies the current Level of the targeted monster when "Copy Plant"'s effect resolves. If the targeted monster's Level changes after "Copy Plant"'s effect has resolved, "Copy Plant" keeps the level it copied when its effect resolved.
*   If "Copy Plant" is equipped with "Demotion", when "Copy Plant" uses its effect to copy the Level of a Plant-Type monster, the copied value is reduced by 2 for "Demotion".
*   "Copy Plant"'s effect can target a Plant-Type monster of equal Level, and it can target another "Copy Plant".

  
## CORE BLAST

*   This effect does not target.
*   You can destroy any cards your opponent controls, not just monsters.
*   If you do not control a face-up “Koa’ki Meiru” monster when the effect of “Core Blast” resolves, you can still destroy your opponent’s cards.
*   You can activate the effect of “Core Blast” in the same Chain that you flip the card face-up.

  
## CORE BLASTER

*   Both effects of this card start a Chain.
*   If the equipped monster is removed from the field in the middle of a resolving Chain, you will miss the timing to activate the effect to return this card to your hand.

  
## CORE COMPRESSION

*   Revealing “Iron Core of Koa’ki Meiru” and discarding 1 “Koa’ki Meiru” monster are both costs.
*   If your hand is being revealed by the effect of “Respect Play” or “Ceremonial Bell” you cannot activate this card.

  
## CORE REINFORCEMENT

*   This card targets 1 “Koa’ki Meiru” monster in your Graveyard. The effect of “Core Reinforcement” that deals damage to its controller starts a Chain.
*   If your face-up “Core Reinforcement” is destroyed during the End Phase by “Mystical Space Typhoon,” you will not take damage equal to the Summoned monster’s ATK.
*   If “Imperial Custom” is face-up on the field and the monster Summoned by “Core Reinforcement” is destroyed, “Core Reinforcement” will remain face-up on the field but the controller will still take damage. If “Core Reinforcement” and the monster it has Summoned are destroyed at the same time, such as by “Icarus Attack,” the effect to inflict damage will still be applied.

  
## CORRUPTION CELL 'A'

*   If an effect is chained to this card that shifts the target monster from your opponent’s side of the field to your side of the field, the targeting specifications are no longer met, so the effect will disappear.

  
## COSMIC FORTRESS GOL’GAR  
> ① Once per turn, you can select any number of face-up Spell or Trap Cards. Return those cards to their owners' hands, and distribute new A-Counters among monsters on the field equal to the number of cards returned. ② Once per turn, you can remove 2 A-Counters from anywhere on the field to destroy 1 card your opponent controls.

*   The ① Ignition Effect targets a number of face-up Spell / Trap Cards on the field.
    *   The targeted cards are returned to the hand when the effect resolves. This is not a cost.
    *   If a chained effect destroys a Spell/Trap Card targeted by “Cosmic Fortress Gol’gar” before it is returned to the hand, no A-Counter is distributed for that particular Spell/Trap Card.
    *   The number of A-Counters distributed is based on the number of Spell/Trap Cards actually returned to the hand.
*   The ② Ignition Effect targets 1 card your opponent controls.
    *   Removing 2 A-Counters (from anywhere on the field) is a cost.

  
## COSMIC HORROR GANGI'EL

*   If you activate “Soul Exchange” and target 1 of your opponent’s monsters, “Cosmic Horror Gangi’el” cannot be Tribute Summoned by Tributing just that 1 monster. That monster is still on your opponent’s side of the field, so it does not satisfy the requirement.

  
## COST DOWN

*   The Level of a monster which is Summoned using "Cost Down" is still decreased by 2 after Summoning. The 2 Level reduction lasts until the End Phase.
*   When you Ritual Summon while "Cost Down" is active, the Level Stars that you need is not changed, even if you are using "Contract with the Abyss" or "Earth Chant".
*   You can use multiple "Cost Downs" in the same turn and their effects accumulate, so 3 "Cost Downs" lowers the level by 6 Stars.
*   While "A Legendary Ocean" and 1 "Cost Down" are active, your WATER monsters are reduced by 3 Stars.

  
## CREATURE SEIZURE

*   If, due to an effect chained to “Creature Seizure” you control no face-up Normal Monsters when it resolves, no monsters switch control.

  
## CREATURE SWAP

*   "Creature Swap" does not target. The monsters are chosen when its effect resolves, not when "Creature Swap" is activated.
*   The opponent cannot chain "Fairy’s Hand Mirror", "Riryoku Field", or "Shift" to "Creature Swap" because it does not target. For the same reason, "Lord of D." does not prevent Dragon-Type monsters from being selected, and "Freed the Matchless General" will not negate the effect of "Creature Swap".
*   Both players must have at least 1 eligible monster on the field for "Creature Swap" to be activated. If the opponent chains a card (such as "Ring of Destruction") to destroy the only monster on one side of the field, the effect of "Creature Swap" disappears.
*   Monsters affected by "Creature Swap" do not return to their owner’s control at the end of the turn, they stay under the opponent’s control until removed from the field or a card effect such as "Remove Brainwashing" says otherwise.
*   The battle position of monsters affected by "Creature Swap" may be changed by card effects the turn "Creature Swap" was activated.
*   A player may select a monster that had its battle position changed earlier in the turn (manually or by card effect).
*   A player may select a Monster Token.
*   A player may select a monster Special Summoned by "Call of the Haunted" or "Premature Burial". If the "Call of the Haunted" or "Premature Burial", still on the opponent’s side of the field, is destroyed, the monster targeted by those cards is destroyed also.
*   A player may select a monster that is equipped with "Snatch Steal". The original owner of the creature, who now controls the creature again, will still gain 1000 Life Points each turn from the opponent’s "Snatch Steal" card as long as it remains on the field.
*   A player may activate "Change of Heart" to gain control of an opponent’s monster, and then activate "Creature Swap" and select that monster to return to the opponent. At the end of the turn, the monster targeted by "Change of Heart" does not switch sides again since it is already on the owner’s side of the field.

  
## CREEPING DOOM MANTA

*   The effect of this monster prevents the activation of Trap Cards that can be activated when a monster is Normal Summoned, such as "Trap Hole" and "Torrential Tribute".
*   You can activate Trap Cards later in the turn.
*   You can negate the Normal Summon of this monsters with "Horn of Heaven" or "Solemn Judgment". (In which case the Normal Summon failed and the effect of the monster is not applied.)
*   The effect of this monster is applied to both players (so you cannot activate "Pineapple Blast" in response to your Normal Summon of this monster).
*   This is a Continuous Effect that you cannot chain to.

  
## CRIMSON FIRE

*   If the opponent activates a card that inflicts damage to both players, such as "Tremendous Fire", and you respond with “Crimson Fire,” you take no damage and your opponent takes 2500 damage (the 500 normal, plus double the 1000 damage you would have taken).
*   If you control “Red Dragon Archfiend/Assault Mode” but not “Red Dragon Archfiend,” you cannot activate “Crimson Fire.”

  
## CRIMSON SENTRY

*   "Crimson Sentry"'s effect can be activated before or after your monster(s) are destroyed in battle, similar to "Last Will".

  
## CRIOSPHINX

*   The effect of “Criosphinx” is a Trigger Effect, and can be chained to. You can activate “Divine Wrath” against it. If a monster is returned to the hand in the middle of a chain, the effect of “Criosphinx” activates as a new chain after the previous chain has finished resolving.
*   If multiple copies of “Criosphinx” are in play and a monster is returned to the hand, all copies will activate. It forms a chain, with the turn player’s “Criosphinx” as chain link 1.
*   If multiple monsters are sent to the hand simultaneously (such as with “Guardian Sphinx”), the effect of “Criosphinx” only activates once, so only 1 card is sent to the Graveyard.

  
## CROSS COUNTER

*   You activate "Cross Counter" before damage calculation but after flipping the attacked monster face-up. The "Cross Counter" card is sent to the Graveyard after resolving its effect and destroying the attacking monster.
*   The effect of "Cross Counter" only applies to the one attack and does not continue for the rest of the turn.
*   If your opponent’s "Amazoness Swords Woman" attacks your Defense Position "Mystical Elf", and you activate "Cross Counter", you (the controller of "Cross Counter" and "Mystical Elf") take 1000 points of damage due to the effect of "Amazoness Swords Woman", and then "Cross Counter" destroys "Amazoness Swords Woman".
*   "Cross Counter" is not an effect that targets.
*   The effect of "Cross Counter" that destroys a monster does not start a chain.
*   If your "Stone Statue of the Aztecs" is defending and you activate "Cross Counter" the Battle Damage your opponent takes is only doubled once (by either the effect of "Cross Counter" or "Stone Statue of the Aztecs").

  
## CROSS PORTER  
> ① You can send 1 monster you control to the Graveyard and Special Summon 1 “Neo-Spacian” monster from your hand. ② When this card is sent to the Graveyard, you can add 1 “Neo-Spacian” monster from your Deck to your hand.

*   The ① Ignition Effect targets 1 monster you control.
    *   The target is sent to the Graveyard when the effect resolves.
    *   If "Cross Porter" targets itself and is flipped face-down (by "Book of Moon"), the effect still resolves.
    *   If another monster targeted by this effect is flipped face-down / removed from the field, this effect will resolve without effect. This is also applies if "Cross Porter" targets itself and leaves the field.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect follows a "When... you can" structure and can miss the timing
    *   If "Cross Porter" targets itself with its first effect, its second effect CANNOT be activated.

  
## CRUSADER OF ENDYMION

*   The effect to increase this card’s ATK is resolved only if you place a Spell Counter.
*   This effect targets the card you place a Spell Counter on.
*   You cannot place a Spell Counter on this card. If “Skill Drain” is activated, this card loses any ATK gained from its own effect.
*   If a card like “Breaker the Magical Warrior” is having its effect negated, you cannot place a Spell Counter on it with this effect.
*   If the target of this effect is face-down when the effect resolves, no Spell Counter is placed and no ATK is gained.

  
## CRY HAVOC!

*   You can activate (flip face-up) "Cry Havoc!" during any Game Phase, but you can only activate its effect during your Main Phase.
*   Removing 1 monster in your Graveyard from play is a cost to activate the effect of "Cry Havoc!".
*   If you Set a Normal Monster with the effect of "Cry Havoc!", you do not have to reveal it to your opponent.
*   If you activate "Double Summon" during your Main Phase and activate the effect of "Cry Havoc!", the Normal Summon or Set with "Cry Havoc!" does not use one of the 2 Normal Summons or Sets allowed with "Double Summon".

  
## CRYSTAL ABUNDANCE

*   Sending 4 "Crystal Beast" Monster Cards from your Spell & Trap Card Zone to the Graveyard is a cost to activate this card.
*   You can activate this card when there are no cards on your opponent’s side of the field. However, you cannot Special Summon any “Crystal Beast” monsters from your Graveyard if you do.
*   You cannot activate this card while "Macro Cosmos" is active.
*   You can activate this card while "Dimensional Fissure" is active. The "Crystal Beast" Monster Cards sent to pay the cost are sent to the Graveyard, not removed from play.

## CRYSTAL BEACON

*   You must have at least 2 “Crystal Beast” monsters in your Spell & Trap Card Zone when you activate this card and when it resolves. If the number of “Crystal Beast” monsters in your Spell & Trap Card Zone becomes less than 2 due to an effect chained to this card, then you cannot Special Summon.

  
## CRYSTAL BEAST AMBER MAMMOTH

*   You cannot activate this effect when “Crystal Beast Amber Mammoth” itself is selected as the attack target.
*   You can activate this effect when a replay is triggered and a “Crystal Beast” monster you control is selected as an attack target.
*   If you control multiple copies of “Crystal Beast Amber Mammoth,” you can activate each of their effects, using the Chain. The “Crystal Beast Amber Mammoth” whose effect resolves last (Chain Link 1) will become the new attack target.

*   If a "Crystal Beast" battles with a monster such as "Dark Magician of Chaos" or "D.D. Warrior" it will be removed from play by that monster's effect, you cannot activate your "Crystal Beast"'s effect.

*   You can use a "Crystal Beast" that is being treated as a Continuous Spell Card for the cost to Special Summon "Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder" or "Anteatereatingant".

  
## CRYSTAL BLESSING

*   You cannot target more “Crystal Beast” monsters in your Graveyard than you have empty Spell & Trap Card Zones when you activate this card.
*   If you have no empty Spell & Trap Card Zones when this card resolves due to an effect chained to this card, you cannot place any “Crystal Beast” monsters in your Spell & Trap Card Zones.
*   If you target 2 “Crystal Beast” monsters in your Graveyard, but the number of your empty Spell & Trap Card Zones is reduced to 1 by an effect chained to this card, you can choose which of those 2 cards to place in your Spell & Trap Card Zones when this card resolves.
*   If an effect like "D.D. Crow" is chained to "Crystal Blessing" to remove one of the targeted "Crystal Beast" monsters from your Graveyard, the remaining target is still placed in your Spell & Trap Card Zone.

  
## CRYSTAL COUNTER

*   You cannot activate "Crystal Counter" when there are no "Crystal Beast" monsters in your Graveyard.
*   You cannot activate "Crystal Counter" if it is the only card in your Spell and Trap Card Zone.

  
## CRYSTAL PAIR

*   If you cannot place a "Crystal Beast" monster into your Spell and Trap Card Zone, the effect to prevent Battle Damage is not applied.
*   You cannot activate "Crystal Pair" if you do not have any open Spell or Trap Card Zone spaces.

  
## CRYSTAL SEER

*   If you have 1 or fewer cards in your Deck when this card’s effect resolved, the effect disappears, and you cannot pick up any cards from your Deck.
*   If your opponent's "Parasite Paracide" is among the card's you pick up with the effect of "Crystal Seer", you can add that card to your hand.

  
## CRYSTAL TREE

*   "Crystal Tree"'s effect cannot be activated if you do not have enough "Crystal Beast" monsters remaining in your Deck. Example: If you have 4 Crystal Counters on "Crystal Tree" but only 3 "Crystal Beast" monsters remaining in your Deck, you cannot activate "Crystal Tree"'s effect.
*   "Crystal Tree"'s effect cannot be activated if you do not have enough open Spell and Trap Card Zone spaces for the "Crystal Beast" monsters that would be placed into your Spell and Trap Card Zone with "Crystal Tree"'s effect. Example: If you have 4 Crystal Counters on "Crystal Tree" but only 2 open Spell and Trap Card Zone spaces, you cannot activate "Crystal Tree"'s effect.
*   When a "Crystal Beast" monster is equipped to "Relinquished" with its effect, a Crystal Counter is placed onto "Crystal Tree".

  
## CÚ CHULAINN THE AWAKENED

*   This is an Ignition Effect.
*   Removing from play a monster from your Graveyard is part of the effect, it is not a cost.
*   This effect targets 1 Normal Monster in your Graveyard.

  
## CUNNING OF THE SIX SAMURAI

*   The face-up “Six Samurai” monster sent from the field to the Graveyard is a cost to activate “Cunning of the Six Samurai”.
*   You can Special Summon the same “Six Samurai” monster that was sent to the Graveyard to pay the activation cost of “Cunning of the Six Samurai”.
*   You cannot activate "Cunning of the Six Samurai" if there are no "Six Samurai" monsters in the Graveyard.

  
## CUP OF ACE

*   You cannot activate "Cup of Ace" if you or your opponent has 1 or fewer cards remaining in the Deck.
*   Tossing a coin is not a cost. The coin is tossed when "Cup of Ace" resolves.

  
## CURSE OF AGING

*   You cannot decrease ATK/DEF by 1000 points by discarding 2 cards; you can only discard 1 card.
*   Discarding a card is a cost.
*   The effect of "Curse of Aging" is not applied to face-down monsters. It is only applied to the face-up monsters on the field when "Curse of Aging" resolves. It is not applied to monsters Summoned after "Curse of Aging" resolves, either. (Similar to "Limiter Removal"). This means that even if face-down monsters are flipped face-up in the same turn, their ATK or DEF are not changed by the effect of "Curse of Aging", even if they were on the field (face-down) when "Curse of Aging" resolved.

  
## CURSE OF ANUBIS

*   "Curse of Anubis" does not apply to monsters that are Summoned after "Curse of Anubis"' effect is applied.
*   If "Book of Moon" is chained to "Curse of Anubis" to flip a monster face-down, the effect of "Curse of Anubis" is not applied to the monster that was flipped face-down.

  
## CURSE OF DARKNESS

*   "Curse of Darkness" inflicts 1000 damage right after the Spell Card is activated, not when it resolves. If the Spell Card's activation is negated however, such as with "Magic Jammer", then no damage is inflicted because the activation was negated.
*   "Curse of Darkness" does not form a new chain and cannot be chained to. You can chain to the Spell Card itself, after "Curse of Darkness" inflicts its 1000 damage.
*   Even if your opponent targets your face-up "Curse of Darkness" with "Mystical Space Typhoon", he/she takes 1000 damage before "Mystical Space Typhoon" resolves and destroys "Curse of Darkness".
*   When "Curse of Darkness" is active, and you activate "Double Spell", you take 1000 damage for activating "Double Spell" but not for the target of "Double Spell", because it is not considered "activated".
*   If you send "Curse of Darkness" to the Graveyard as part of the cost of "Emergency Provisions", then "Curse of Darkness" is no longer on the field immediately after activation of "Emergency Provisions", and "Curse of Darkness'" effect is not activated.

  
## CURSE OF FIEND  
> Changes the battle positions of all Attack Position monsters on the field to Defense Position and vice-versa. These positions cannot be changed during the turn this card is activated except by the effect of a Spell, Trap or Effect Monster Card. You can activate this card only during your Standby Phase.

*   This card must be Set in order to be activated during your Standby Phase. During your Standby Phase you flip up the face-down "Curse of Fiend" to activate its effect.
*   Face-down monsters changed to Attack Position will have their Flip Effects (and "_when this card is flipped face-up_" Trigger Effects) activated \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=282964)\]. This is NOT a Flip Summon, and will not cause "Swarm of Scarabs" to activate its Trigger Effect.
*   VS. "Final Attack Order": While "Final Attack Orders" is active, you can change the Battle Positions of monsters with "Curse of Fiend" or "Little-Winguard", but the Battle Positions are immediately changed back to Attack Position by "Final Attack Orders".
*   VS. "Destiny Hero Diamond Dude": You cannot activate the effect of "Curse of Fiend", because it can only be activated during the Standby Phase.

  
## CURSE OF ROYAL

*   You can only activate "Curse of Royal" as a chain to a Spell or Trap Card that would destroy 1 (and ONLY 1) Spell or Trap Card.
*   You can use Curse of Royal against cards like "Magic Jammer", "Seven Tools of the Bandit", "Solemn Judgment", "Curse of Royal", "Mystical Space Typhoon", "Dust Tornado", "Magic Drain", "Riryoku Field", "Judgment of Anubis", etc.
*   You cannot use "Curse of Royal" against "Heavy Storm" or "Harpie’s Feather Duster".

  
## CURSED SEAL OF THE FORBIDDEN SPELL

*   "Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell" only negates the activation of Spell Cards. It does not prevent the use of Continuous Spell Cards already active, like "Archfiend's Oath".
*   If you activate a Spell Card and chain "Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell", then your opponent cannot activate Spell Cards of the same name, even though your opponent didn't activate the Spell Card in the first place.
*   When you negate and destroy "Black Pendant" with "Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell", and afterwards a Set "Black Pendant" is destroyed, the effect of "Black Pendant" will not be activated (neither the "Black Pendant" that was negated nor the Set "Black Pendant" destroyed later will inflict 500 damage).

  
## CYBER ARCHFIEND

*   If this card is face-down during the End Phase, it is not destroyed by its effect.
*   If you have multiple “Cyber Archfiends” on the field during the Draw Phase, their effects form a chain.

  
## CYBER BARRIER DRAGON

*   Even if there are 2 or more “Cyber Barrier Dragon” on your side of the field in Attack Position, only the first attack is negated.
*   If you negate the first attack of “Mataza the Zapper”, it can still attack a 2nd time. “Asura Priest” could also attack again, as long as it attacks a different monster.
*   You must use the effect of “Cyber Barrier Dragon”. You cannot save it for later or choose to allow your opponent’s first attack to go through.
*   If you activate “Attack Reflector Unit” to Tribute a monster and Summon “Cyber Barrier Dragon” during the Battle Step, a replay occurs. If your opponent continues to attack with the same monster, the attack has already been declared, so the effect of “Cyber Barrier Dragon” will not stop it. However, if your opponent attacks again after that, or chooses to attack with a different monster, “Cyber Barrier Dragon” will use its effect to negate that attack.
*   If you Special Summon "Cyber Barrier Dragon" during the Battle Phase after your opponent has already made one attack, you must use its effect to negate the next attack they make that Battle Phase.
*   If you activate “Attack Reflector Unit” to Tribute a monster and Summon “Cyber Barrier Dragon” during the Battle Step, a replay occurs. If your opponent continues to attack with the same monster, the attack has already been declared, so the effect of “Cyber Barrier Dragon” will not stop it. However, if your opponent attacks again after that, or chooses to attack with a different monster, “Cyber Barrier Dragon” will use its effect to negate that attack.

  
## CYBER BLADER

*   “Cyber Blader” only has 1 of her 3 effects at any one time. For example, if the opponent has 3 monsters, only her third effect applies, not the first or second effects.
*   When applying the effect to double this card’s ATK, double the total amount. So if you equip “Cyber Blader” with “Axe of Despair”, her ATK will become 6200. (2100 + 1000) x 2 = 6200.
*   When the opponent has exactly 3 monsters, “Cyber Blader”’s effect only negates the effects of Spell, Trap, and Effect Monster Cards that activate or are active on the field. It will not negate the effect of “Sangan” or “D.D. Survivor”.
*   The effect of “Cyber Blader” changes immediately when the number of monsters the opponent controls changes.
*   Example 1: The opponent controls “Gemini Elf” and “Dark Magician”. The opponent attacks with their “Dark Magician”, attacking “Cyber Blader”, whose ATK is currently doubled. The opponent activates “Mystik Wok” and Tributes their “Gemini Elf” to gain 1900 Life Points. “Cyber Blader” now has 2100 ATK points, so it does not destroy “Dark Magician”, but since the opponent has only 1 monster now, “Cyber Blader” is not destroyed as a result of battle, either.
*   Example 2: The opponent has 3 monsters on the field, 1 of them is “Exiled Force”. The opponent Tributes “Exiled Force” to activate its effect and destroy “Cyber Blader”. Now they only have 2 monsters on the field, so the effect of “Exiled Force” is not negated and “Cyber Blader” is destroyed.

  
## CYBER DINOSAUR  
> ① When your opponent Special Summons a monster from their hand, you can Special Summon this card from your hand.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect can miss its activation timing.
    *   You can activate this effect if the last thing to happen was your opponent Special Summoning of a monster from their hand.
    *   This effect cannot be activated during the Damage Step.
    *   If you have 2 "Cyber Dinosaurs" in your hand when your opponent Special Summons a monster from their hand, you can only activate the effect of 1 of the "Cyber Dinosaurs".
    *   If your opponent Special Summons a monster from their hand while "Stumbling" is active, you can chain "Cyber Dinosaur"'s effect (Chain Link 2) to the effect of "Stumbling" (Chain Link 1).
*   If "Gorz the Emissary of Darkness" is Special Summoned from your opponent's hand with its effect when you inflict damage to their life points with a card effect, you can chain "Cyber Dinosaur"'s effect to "Gorz the Emissary of Darkness'" damage inflicting effect.

  
## CYBER DRAGON

*   You can only use the effect of “Cyber Dragon” to Special Summon itself during your Main Phase.
*   The effect of “Cyber Dragon” does not start a chain.
*   You can negate the Special Summon of “Cyber Dragon” with “Royal Oppression”, “Solemn Judgment”, or “Horn of Heaven”.

  
## CYBER DRAGON ZWEI

*   Revealing a Spell Card is a cost.
*   If you activate “Inferno Reckless Summon” when “Proto-Cyber Dragon” is Summoned while you have 1 “Cyber Dragon” in your Deck and 3 “Cyber Dragon Zwei” in your Graveyard and only 3 Monster Card Zones open, you choose which monsters you want to Special Summon. Any monster that you cannot Special Summon is sent to the Graveyard.
*   When “Cyber Dragon Zwei” attacks, it gains 300 ATK at the start of the Damage Step and keeps it until the end of the Damage Step.
*   If “Cyber Dragon Zwei” is being treated as “Cyber Dragon” by its own effect and “Skill Drain” is activated, the name is still treated as “Cyber Dragon.”

  
## CYBER ELTANIN  
> Ⓒ This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set. Ⓢ This card cannot be Special Summoned except by removing from play all face-up LIGHT Machine-Type monsters from your side of the field and your Graveyard. ① This card's ATK and DEF are equal to the number of monsters removed from play for its Special Summon x 500. ② When this card is Special Summoned, send all other face-up monsters on the field to the Graveyard.

*   The Ⓢ Special Summon Effect is the only way to Special Summon this card.
    *   This Summon does not start a chain.
    *   This card CANNOT be Special Summoned from the Graveyard / removed from play area.
    *   Only LIGHT-Attribute Machine-Type monsters (and Tokens) are removed from play as a cost.

    *   The ATK/DEF become "0" if it is flipped face-down, leaves the field, or "Skill Drain" negates its effects.
    *   The Original ATK of "Cyber Eltanin" is treated as 0 while it is on the field. If "Megamorph" is equipped, it will have 0 ATK. When the effect of "Megamorph" is no longer applied, its ATK returns to 500x the number of monsters removed from play to Special Summon "Cyber Eltanin".
*   The ② Mandatory Trigger Effect activates in the Summon response timing.
    *   This effect does not affect face-down monsters.
    *   This effect 'sends' monster cards to the Graveyard; it does not 'destroy' them.

## CYBER ESPER

*   You can use this effect during the Damage Step.

  
## CYBER GYMNAST

*   This effect targets 1 face-up Attack Position monster. If an effect is chained to change the target to anything other than face-up Attack Position, then the targeting conditions are no longer correct and it will not be destroyed.

  
## CYBER JAR

*   Spirit Monsters, Toon Monsters, Ritual Monsters, etc. are sent to your hand as they cannot be Special Summoned or must be Special Summoned is a specific way.
*   Both players reveal all 5 cards to each other, and then the turn player may Special Summon his monsters, then the opponent. After revealing the cards, you may shuffle them around so you can Special Summon monsters face-down without the opponent knowing which monster is which.
*   If "Sangan" or "Witch of the Black Forest" was destroyed by "Cyber Jar"’s effect, Special Summon monsters first and then complete "Sangan"’s effect.
*   If you attacked your opponent’s face-down "Cyber Jar", after its effect resolves you can then attack with any monsters you Special Summoned in Attack Position before you enter your Main Phase 2.
*   "Torrential Tribute" can be used on monsters Summoned by "Cyber Jar" but not if "Cyber Jar" was flipped face-up in the Damage Step, since "Torrential Tribute" cannot be activated during the Damage Step.
*   If a player has less than 5 cards in their Deck, they do not lose (since you are picking-up cards, not drawing), they pick up however many cards they have and continue with "Cyber Jar"’s effect.

  
## CYBER KIRIN

*   “Cyber Kirin’s” effect is an Ignition Effect, so you can only activate it during your own Main Phases.

  
## CYBER LASER DRAGON

*   This card’s effect targets. You can destroy “Cyber Laser Dragon” with its own effect.
*   The ATK or DEF of the targeted monster must be greater than (or equal to) the ATK of “Cyber Laser Dragon” when the effect resolves in order for it to be destroyed. Example: You target “Jinzo” with this card’s effect. The opponent chains “Rush Recklessly” to raise “Cyber Laser Dragon’s” ATK to 3100. “Jinzo” is not destroyed.
*   If “Book of Moon” is chained to “Cyber Laser Dragon’s” effect to turn either the targeted monster or “Cyber Laser Dragon” face-down, its effect will not resolve because both monsters’ ATK / DEF values can no longer be compared.

  
## CYBER OUROBOROS

*   This effect is a Trigger Effect. Sending 1 card from your hand to the Graveyard is a cost.
*   You can activate "Cyber Ouroboros'" effect during the Damage Step.

  
## CYBER PHOENIX  
> ① While this card is in face-up Attack Position, negate the effects of any Spell or Trap Card that targets 1 Machine-Type monster you control. ② When this face-up card attacks or is attacked, and it is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, you can draw 1 card.

*   The ① Continuous Effect only applies while this card is in face-up Attack Position.
    *   Your Machine-Type monster Summoned by "Call of the Haunted" is not destroyed when "Call of the Haunted" leaves the field. This also applies to “D.D.R. - Different Dimension Reincarnation”.
    *   Union Monsters can equip to Machine-Type monsters you control, but all their effects are negated.
    *   This does not negate effects that target 2(+) cards (like "Icarus Attack").

*   The ② optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.

## CYBER SHADOW GARDNA

*   A Field Spell Card or similar effect will adjust the ATK/DEF of “Cyber Shadow Gardna” accordingly after it copies the ATK & DEF of another monster.
*   You cannot chain to the effect of “Cyber Shadow Gardna” that copies another monster’s ATK & DEF.
*   “Light of Intervention” only stops you from Setting monsters. Since the final effect of “Cyber Shadow Gardna” Sets it as a Trap Card, this effect will still happen even if “Light of Intervention” is active.
*   If you use “Limiter Removal” on your “Cyber Shadow Gardna”, both effects (destroy it because of “Limiter Removal”, and change it back into a Trap Card by its own effect) happen during the End Phase in the order of the controller’s preference.

  
## CYBER TUTU

*   “Cyber Tutu” cannot attack directly if the opponent controls any face-down monsters.
*   If “Cyber Tutu” uses her effect to attack directly, you can activate “Rush Recklessly” during the DAMAGE STEP, and even if it raises her ATK higher than the ATK of an opponent’s monster a replay will not occur. But if you activate “Rush Recklessly” during the BATTLE STEP, a replay will occur.

## CYBERNETIC MAGICIAN

*   The effect of “Cybernetic Magician” is an Ignition Effect that targets a monster.
*   Since “Cybernetic Magician” makes the ATK “become” 2000, that is the new value. Even if the monster was equipped with an Equip Spell Card, the ATK is 2000 and is not adjusted, even if the Equip Spell Card is destroyed. (However, if equipped after the effect of “Cybernetic Magician” resolves, the ATK will be adjusted from the new level of 2000 points.)
*   If a monster is getting an ATK adjustment because of a Field Spell Card, and you use the effect of “Cybernetic Magician” on it, then its ATK becomes 2000 and is not adjusted by the Field Spell Card until the effect of “Cybernetic Magician” expires. (However, if a new Field Spell Card is activated that changes the ATK, it will adjust it from the new 2000 ATK level.)
*   You cannot target a monster with “Cybernetic Magician” if its ATK is already 2000 (like “Vampire Lord”). This includes monsters that have 2000 ATK because of the effect of “Cybernetic Magician”.

*   The effect of this card only applies to the "Gradius" that it is equipped to.

  
## CYCLONE BOOMERANG

*   When a monster equipped with “Cyclone Boomerang” is destroyed by a card effect, its effect starts a chain. “Barrel Behind the Door” can be activated in response.


## D - FORMATION

*   Placing 1 D Counter onto "D - Formation" does not start a Chain.
*   The second effect of "D - Formation" starts a Chain. It does not target.
*   You cannot activate "D-Formation"'s second effect when you Special Summon a monster face-down.
*   If an effect is chained that flips the Normal or Special Summoned monster face-down, "D-Formation"'s effect disappears.
*   If you have 2 or more "D-Formations" with 2 D Counters when you Normal or Special Summon a monster, you can activate the second effect of each "D-Formation".
*   If a card’s effect Special Summons multiple monsters during your Main Phase, you can activate the second effect of "D-Formation". In this case you will select which monster you will apply towards the effect when "D-Formation"'s effect resolves.

  
## D - TIME

*   If you have “A Legendary Ocean” on the field and “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” is destroyed, you can activate “D – Time” and add a Level 4 or lower monster to your hand. If “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” is returned to the hand, then you can only add a Level 3 or lower monster to your hand because the effect of “A Legendary Ocean” still applies to “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” while he’s in your hand.

  
## D. D. CRAZY BEAST

*   "D.D. Crazy Beast"'s effect is applied at the end of the Damage Step, removing the destroyed monster from play instead of sending it to the Graveyard.
*   If "D.D. Crazy Beast" attacks an Attack Position monster with the same ATK and both monsters are destroyed, "D.D. Crazy Beast"'s effect is not applied.

  
## D. D. DESIGNATOR

*   You can't activate "D. D. Designator" if you have no cards in your hand, or if "D. D. Designator" is the only card in your hand.

*   If you activate "D. D. Designator" and your opponent has 2 copies of the same card in hand, you (the player who activated "D. D. Designator") select which of the 2 cards is removed from play (this can be important if your opponent holds your card because of "Exchange").

  
## D. D. DYNAMITE

*   Count the number of cards removed from play when “D. D. Dynamite” resolves, not when it is activated.

  
## D.D. SCOUT PLANE

*   "D. D. Scout Plane"'s effect can only activate once during the same End Phase, so if a combo of "Banisher of the Light" and "King Tiger Wanghu" is set up, "D. D. Scout Plane" will only be Special Summoned once.
*   It is the OWNER of "D. D. Scout Plane" that Special Summons it. Even if your opponent controls your "D. D. Scout Plane", if it is removed from play, you get to Special Summon it.
*   If you don't have a vacant Monster Card Zone when "D. D. Scout Plane" would be Special Summoned, "D. D. Scout Plane" is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.
*   "D. D. Scout Plane"'s effect activates whether it is removed from your hand, Deck, Graveyard, or the field.
*   If "D. D. Scout Plane" is removed from play and is face-down while out of play, such as with "Lightforce Sword" or "Different Dimension Capsule", "D. D. Scout Plane"'s effect does not activate. But if "D. D. Scout Plane" was face-down on the field, and was removed by "Nobleman of Crossout", it is placed face-up while out of play and its effect does activate.
*   If "D. D. Scout Plane" is face-down on the field while "Banisher of the Light" is in play, and "D. D. Scout Plane" is destroyed by "Raigeki Break", it is removed from play and its effect activates because it is placed face-up out of play.
*   If "D. D. Scout Plane" is destroyed by "Dark Ruler Ha Des" and then removed from play to Special Summon "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End", "D. D. Scout Plane"'s effect activates and it will be Special Summoned.
*   If "D. D. Scout Plane" is destroyed by "Lesser Fiend", "D. D. Scout Plane"'s effect activates and it is Special Summoned even if "Dark Ruler Ha Des" was also in play when it was destroyed.
*   If "D. D. Scout Plane" is removed during an End Phase, it is Special Summoned with its effect during that same End Phase.
*   If "D. D. Scout Plane" is removed from play and then returned to the Graveyard with "Miracle Dig" the same turn, its effect is reset and it remains in the Graveyard and is not Special Summoned.
*   If "Prohibition" was used and "D. D. Scout Plane" is prohibited, "D. D. Scout Plane" cannot be Special Summoned and remains removed from play.
*   If "D. D. Scout Plane" is removed from play with "Different Dimension Gate", "D. D. Scout Plane"'s effect activates and "D. D. Scout Plane" is Special Summoned. If "Different Dimension Gate" is later destroyed, the other removed monster is returned to the field at that time.

## DARK CALLING  
> Remove from play, from your hand or your Graveyard, the Fusion Material Monsters listed on a Fusion Monster Card that can only be Special Summoned with "Dark Fusion", and Special Summon that monster from your Fusion Deck. (This Special Summon is treated as a Fusion Summon with "Dark Fusion".)

*   You can remove from play monsters both in your hand or Graveyard, so you can remove from play only monsters in your Graveyard, only monsters in your hand, or monsters in your hand and Graveyard.

*   When you Special Summon a Fiend-Type Fusion Monster with “Dark Fusion” and during the same turn control of the Fiend-Type Fusion Monster is shifted to your opponent (with “Creature Swap”, etc.), your opponent still cannot target that Fiend-Type Fusion Monster with the effects of Spell, Trap, or Monster Cards until the end of the turn, even though they now control the Fiend-Type Fusion Monster.
*   If the Fiend-Type Fusion Monster Fusion Summoned by “Dark Fusion” is sent to the Graveyard, the effect that prevents it from being targeted by the opponent’s Spell, Trap, and Monster Card effects is no longer applied.
*   If the Fiend-Type Fusion Monster Fusion Summoned by “Dark Fusion” is flipped face-down, the effect that prevents it from being targeted by the opponent’s Spell, Trap, and Monster Card effects is no longer applied.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates AFTER a Spell Card's activation resolved (starting a new chain).

    *   This effect WILL NOT trigger in response to the effect of face-up Spell Card (ex: "Black Garden").
    *   This effect WILL NOT trigger if "Dark Horus" is flipped face-down before it can activate its effect.
    *   This effect WILL NOT resolve if "Dark Horus" is flipped face-down before resolving its effect.

  
## DARK HUNTER

*   If you activate "Dark Hunter"'s "5 or more" effect and an effect is chained that reduces the number of DARK monsters in your Graveyard to 4 or less, "Dark Hunter"'s effect still resolves.
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, all of "Dark Hunter"'s effects are negated because the primary effect, "This card's effect changes depending on the number of DARK monsters in your Graveyard", is negated.

  
## DARK ILLUSION

*   "Dark Illusion" does not target.

  
## DARK JEROID

*   If the monster selected by "Dark Jeroid" is removed from the field by "Dimensionhole", or flipped face-down, or returned to the hand or Deck, or sent to the Graveyard, etc., the effect of "Dark Jeroid" is reset and the selected monster no longer has a lowered ATK.
*   If "Dark Jeroid" is the only monster on the field when it is Summoned, it reduces its own ATK.
*   The ATK cannot go below zero.

  
## DARK LUCIUS LV6

*   If “Dark Lucius LV6” destroys a monster with an Ignition Effect, like “Exiled Force”, or a monster with a Trigger Effect that wouldn’t activate, like “Mysterious Puppeteer”, then “Dark Lucius LV6” did not negate their effects. So you cannot Special Summon “Dark Lucius LV8”.
*   If “Dark Lucius LV6” destroys “Sangan” while “Macro Cosmos” or “Grave Protector” is active, the effect of “Sangan” cannot activate, so it is not negated. So you cannot Special Summon “Dark Lucius LV8”.
*   If “Dark Lucius LV6” negates an opponent’s monster effect, but is then flipped face-down, you cannot Special Summon “Dark Lucius LV8”. However, if “Dark Lucius LV6” negates a monster effect, and is then temporarily removed from play with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, when it returns to play you can Special Summon “Dark Lucius LV8”.

  
## DARK LUCIUS LV8

*   “Dark Lucius LV8” must be on the field in order to negate a monster’s effect and remove it from play. If “Dark Lucius LV8” is returned to the hand because of “Begone, Knave!”, it does not negate effects or remove monsters from play.
*   If “Dark Lucius LV8” destroys “D.D. Scout Plane”, it will still be Special Summoned because you cannot negate the effect of a monster that is activated while removed from play.

  
## DARK MAGIC ATTACK

*   If you activate "Dark Magic Attack", and the "Dark Magician" is removed from the field with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" or "Compulsory Evacuation Device", or flipped face-down with "Book of Moon", or destroyed by "Ring of Destruction", "Dark Magic Attack"'s effect still resolves.

  
## DARK MAGIC CURTAIN

*   Paying half of your Life Points is a cost to activate “Dark Magic Curtain”.
*   If you Normal Summon, Flip Summon, or Special Summon a monster during a turn, you cannot activate “Dark Magic Curtain” during the same turn. For example, if you Normal Summon a monster during your Main Phase 1 you would not be able to activate “Dark Magic Curtain” during your Main Phase 2.
*   You can Set a monster before or after activating “Dark Magic Curtain”. However, it is not possible to Special Summon monsters face-down, using cards like “The Shallow Grave”, after activating “Dark Magic Curtain”.
*   If the effect of “Cyber Jar” activates during the same turn you activated “Dark Magic Curtain”, you will not be able to Special Summon the Level 4 or lower monsters that you pick up from “Cyber Jar’s” effect. The Level 4 or lower monsters that you pick up will be sent to the Graveyard instead of being Special Summoned.
*   If you Normal Summon, Flip Summon, or Special Summon a monster and the monster’s Summon is negated (by “Horn of Heaven”, “Solemn Judgment”, etc.), you still cannot activate “Dark Magic Curtain” during the same turn.
*   If you activate “Dark Magic Curtain” to Special Summon “Dark Magician” and later in the turn another effect would cause you to Special Summon a monster, you will not be able to Special Summon the monster. For example, your “Insect Queen” would not be able to Special Summon an “Insect Monster Token” during your End Phase.
*   When you activate “Dark Magic Curtain”, you cannot chain cards like “Call of the Haunted” or “Ultimate Offering” because you cannot Normal Summon or Special Summon during the same turn. Also, you cannot activate cards like “Premature Burial” or “Monster Reborn” after activating “Dark Magic Curtain”.
*   You do not have to pay any Life Points to activate “Dark Magic Curtain” while you have “Spell Economics” face-up on your side of the field.
*   If you Chain “Serial Spell” to “Dark Magic Curtain”, the effect that prevents you from Normal Summoning, Flip Summoning, or Special Summoning for the remainder of the turn is still applied. When “Serial Spell” resolves it will Special Summon 1 “Dark Magician” from your Deck and it will apply the Summon-restriction, so when “Dark Magic Curtain’s” effect tries to resolve its effect will disappear because you cannot Special Summon a monster.

  
## DARK MAGICIAN OF CHAOS

*   Missing the Timing: If “Dark Magician of Chaos” is Special Summoned in the middle of a chain (if it is not the last effect in the chain to resolve), the timing will not be correct for its Optional Trigger Effect, so you do NOT return a Spell Card from your Graveyard to your hand.
*   "Dark Magician of Chaos" is NOT removed from play if it is destroyed in your hand or Deck.
*   You can Special Summon "Dark Magician of Chaos" with "Monster Reborn", and then return the "Monster Reborn" to your hand with "Dark Magician of Chaos"' effect.
*   If you Special Summon "Dark Magician of Chaos" face-down with "The Shallow Grave", its effect does not activate.
*   When "Dark Magician of Chaos" is Special Summoned with "Reasoning", his effect activates.
*   When multiple "Dark Magicians of Chaos" are Special Summoned simultaneously, all of their effects activate; the controller starts putting their effects on a chain.
*   When you Tribute Summon "Dark Magician of Chaos" with "Sangan" or "Burning Algae", those cards effects are Step 1 of the chain, and "Dark Magician of Chaos"' effect is Step 2.
*   When you Special Summon "Dark Magician of Chaos" with "Last Turn", you can activate "Dark Magician of Chaos"' effect.
*   "Dark Magician of Chaos"' effect targets 1 Spell Card in the Graveyard, so it will be negated by "Necrovalley" or "The End of Anubis".
*   The Spell Card is chosen at activation of "Dark Magician of Chaos"'s effect, so your opponent could chain "Disappear" or "Graverobber" to deny you that Spell Card.
*   If "Dark Magician of Chaos" attacks a face-down "Fiber Jar" or "Cyber Jar", the Jar is removed from play but its effect is activated.
*   If "Dark Magician of Chaos" attacks a monster with equal ATK, both monsters are removed from play.
*   When "Dark Magician of Chaos" is sent to your hand by "Penguin Soldier", it is removed from play instead.
*   When "Fiber Jar" resolves, a "Dark Magician of Chaos" on the field is removed from play instead of returning to the Deck.
*   When "Dark Magician of Chaos" is removed from play by "Interdimensional Matter Transporter", it is not returned to the field in the End Phase.
*   When a face-down "Dark Magician of Chaos" is destroyed, it is NOT removed from play.
*   If "Dark Magician of Chaos" is equipped to "Relinquished", and is destroyed, then "Dark Magician of Chaos" is removed from play. While "Dark Magician of Chaos" is equipped to "Relinquished", you cannot select "Dark Magician of Chaos" as a card to send to the Graveyard for the effect of "Emergency Provisions".
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, the first and second effects of "Dark Magician of Chaos" are negated, but the 3rd effect is not negated.

  
## DARK MASTER - ZORC

*   Because "Dark Master - Zorc"'s effect is a Ignition Effect, you roll the die during Main Phase 1 or 2 of your turn only.
*   If you roll a 6, "Dark Master - Zorc" is also destroyed.

  
## DARK MIMIC LV3

*   If you take control of your opponent’s "Dark Mimic LV1" with "Snatch Steal", you can send it to the Graveyard during your Standby Phase to Special Summon your "Dark Mimic LV3".
*   You can use "Level Up!" to send "Dark Mimic LV3" to the Graveyard in order to Special Summon "Dark Mimic LV1" because it is mentioned in "Dark Mimic LV3"’s card text.
*   If you use "Level Up!" and send "Dark Mimic LV1" to the Graveyard to Special Summon "Dark Mimic LV3", then "Dark Mimic LV3" was Special Summoned by the effect of "Level Up!", not by the effect of "Dark Mimic LV1". So you only draw 1 card when "Dark Mimic LV3" is sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle.
*   If "Dark Mimic LV3" is Special Summoned by the effect of "Dark Mimic LV1", and is then sent to the Graveyard and revived with "Monster Reborn", you cannot draw 2 cards for "Dark Mimic LV3" because it was Special Summoned by the effect of "Monster Reborn", not by the effect of "Dark Mimic LV1".
*   If "Dark Mimic LV3" is Special Summoned by the effect of "Dark Mimic LV1" and the opponent Summons "Tsukuyomi" to flip "Dark Mimic LV3" face-down and then attacks it, you will only draw 1 card because its effect was reset when it was flipped face-down.
*   The activation timing of "Dark Mimic LV3"’s effect when it is sent to the Graveyard (as a result of battle).
*   If your opponent takes control of your "Dark Mimic LV3" and it is sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle, the owner draws a card because its effect activates in the Graveyard.

  
## DARK MIRROR FORCE

*   "Dark Mirror Force" doesn't stop the attack.
*   Both face-up and face-down Defense Position monsters are removed from play.
*   You can't activate "Dark Mirror Force" if your opponent doesn't have any Defense Position monsters.

  
## DARK NECROFEAR

*   You only remove the 3 Fiend-Type monsters in your Graveyard from play when you Special Summon "Dark Necrofear" from your hand. If you successfully Special Summon it using this method, and then wish to use "Monster Reborn" to Special Summon it from the Graveyard, you do not have to remove 3 more Fiend-Type monsters from the Graveyard.
*   If "Banisher of the Light" is on the field when "Dark Necrofear" is destroyed, the "Dark Necrofear" is removed from play and does not return as an Equip Spell Card.
*   If "Imperial Order" is active when "Dark Necrofear" is destroyed while a Monster Card, it must still be equipped to your opponent’s monster, but you will not gain control of it because its effect is negated by "Imperial Order".
*   If all 5 of your Spell / Trap Card Zones are full during your End Phase of the turn "Dark Necrofear" was destroyed while a Monster Card, you cannot activate its effect, and the effect disappears.
*   If "Dark Necrofear" is destroyed, you can Special Summon it from your Graveyard with "Monster Reborn", "Premature Burial", etc. before your End Phase, and its effect will be reset.
*   If this card was discarded from your hand by an opponent’s card effect, such as "Confiscation" it does not become an Equip Spell Card during the End Phase, since it was not destroyed.
*   If the Special Summoning of "Dark Necrofear" is negated and "Dark Necrofear" is destroyed by the effect of "Solemn Judgment" or "Horn of Heaven", it will become an Equip Spell Card during the End Phase.
*   "Tailor of the Fickle" or "Collected Power" can be used to move "Dark Necrofear" from one monster to another after it is an Equip Spell Card. "Fairy’s Hand Mirror" or "Shift" cannot be used when "Dark Necrofear" first becomes an Equip Spell Card and is equipped to your opponent’s monster.
*   If it is destroyed by your opponent’s "Harpie’s Feather Duster", "Dust Tornado", etc. while it is an Equip Spell Card, "Dark Necrofear" will NOT return during the End Phase since it was NOT destroyed while a Monster Card.
*   If your "Dark Necrofear" is destroyed on your opponent’s side of the field, by either player’s card effect, it will not activate during the End Phase. It must be on your side of the field and sent to your Graveyard when it is destroyed for its effect to activate.

  
## DARK NEPHTHYS

*   "Dark Nephthys'" first effect is an Ignition Effect. Removing DARK monsters from play is a cost.
*   You can activate "Dark Nephthys'" first effect while "Banisher of the Light" or "Macro Cosmos" is face-up, but "Dark Nephthys" will be removed from play.
*   "Dark Nephthys" effect to Special Summon itself starts a Chain.
*   The owner of "Dark Nephthys" Special Summons it, even if their opponent activated its first effect.
*   "Dark Nephthys'" third effect activates whenever it is Special Summoned, including by another card's effect. It is not optional.

  
## DARK PALADIN

*   "Dark Paladin" cannot be Special Summoned, EXCEPT by Fusion Summon. So you cannot Special Summon "Dark Paladin" using "Monster Reborn", etc., even if he was properly Summoned before. You cannot Special Summon "Dark Paladin" using "Magical Scientist", etc.
*   You can use "substitute" Fusion Material Monsters such as "Goddess With the Third Eye", etc. to Fusion Summon "Dark Paladin".
*   "Dark Paladin"'s Spell-negating effect is a Quick Effect, so it can be activated during your opponent's turn.
*   You can activate "Dark Paladin"'s Spell-negating effect multiple times in the same chain.
*   "Dark Paladin"'s Spell-negating effect can be chained to.
*   If you activate "Dark Paladin"'s Spell-negating effect, and your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to destroy "Dark Paladin", the Spell Card is still negated even though "Dark Paladin" is destroyed.
*   If you activate "Dark Paladin"'s Spell-negating effect, and your opponent chains "Book of Moon" to flip "Dark Paladin" face-down, the Spell Card is still negated even though "Dark Paladin" is face-down.
*   "Dark Paladin"'s +500 ATK effect is a Continuous Effect. While "Skill Drain" is active, the effects of "Dark Paladin" are negated.

  
## DARK ROOM OF NIGHTMARE

*   A cost is not damage so this card’s effect does not apply against "Chain Energy", or costs for "Imperial Order", etc.

  
## DARK RULER HA DES  
> Ⓒ This card cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard. ① Negate the effects of Effect Monsters destroyed by battle with Fiend-Type monsters you control.

*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated.
    *   "Dark Ruler Ha Des" cannot be Special Summoned face-down by "The Shallow Grave".
    *   "Dark Ruler Ha Des" can be Special Summoned by "Return from the Different Dimension".
*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate. It also applies to Ha Des.
    *   This effect CANNOT be negated by "Divine Wrath", but CAN be negated by "Skill Drain".
    *   This effect does not apply if "Zombie World" changes to your Fiend-Types into Zombie-Types.
*   Monster destroyed by battle are marked for destruction at the end of Damage Calculation.
    *   Effects that activate in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation are negated.
    *   Effects that activate in Substep 6 - Resolve Effects are negated (ex: "Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter" and "D.D. Warrior Lady").
    *   Effects that activate in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step are negated (ex: "Mystic Tomato").
    *   Effects that activate in the Graveyard are negated; such as "Treeborn Frog", "Plaguespreader Zombie", "Sinister Serpent". The negation is reset if these cards are removed from the Graveyard.
    *   This effect does not affect monsters destroyed as substitutes such as "Six Samurai" monsters, or if "Relinquished" would be destroyed by battle while equipped with "Sangan".
*   If your "Dark Ruler Ha Des" or other Fiend-Type monster destroys "Tyrant Dragon" as a result of battle, a Dragon-Type monster must still be Tributed when "Tyrant Dragon" is Special Summoned from the Graveyard. This is because Tributing a Dragon-Type monster is a condition on the Summoning of the card; it is not part of the effect. For the same reason, if a Spirit Monster is destroyed by a Fiend-Type monster when "Dark Ruler Ha Des" is on the field, it still cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard. Also if two "Dark Ruler Ha Des" destroy each other in battle, neither can be Special Summoned from the Graveyard.

  
## DARK SCORPION - MEANAE THE THORN

*   You can use "Meanae the Thorn"'s effect to add a Monster, Spell, or Trap Card to your hand that includes "Dark Scorpion" in its name, including "Mustering of the Dark Scorpions" and "Dark Scorpion Combination".

  
## DARK SCORPION COMBINATION

*   Dark Scorpions that are Summoned after "Dark Scorpion Combination" resolves cannot attack directly using its effect.
*   When you activate "Dark Scorpion Combination", all the Dark Scorpion cards listed on the text must be face-up on the field.
*   If your opponent has a monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", you must attack that monster if you attack, even if using "Dark Scorpion Combination".
*   "Waboku" will prevent your Dark Scorpions from inflicting Battle Damage, even if you use "Dark Scorpion Combination".

  
## DARK SIMORGH  
> ① While this card is face-up on the field its Attribute is also treated as WIND. ② You can remove from play 1 DARK monster and 1 WIND monster from your Graveyard to Special Summon this card from your hand. ③ You can remove from play 1 DARK monster and 1 WIND monster from your hand to Special Summon this card from your Graveyard. ④ Your opponent cannot Set any cards on the field.

*   You can Normal Summon “Dark Simorgh.”
*   The ① Continuous Effect applies only while "Dark Simorgh" is face-up.
    *   This effect does not apply in the Graveyard.
    *   “Ally of Justice Catastor” will destroy “Dark Simorgh”, as "Dark Simorgh" is also treated as WIND.
    *   This effect will cause "Dark Simorgh" to be sent to the Graveyard while "Gozen Match" applies.
*   The ② Ignition Effect activates & resolves in the hand.
    *   Removing from play 1 DARK monster + 1 WIND monster in your Graveyard is a cost.
*   The ③ Ignition Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   Removing from play 1 DARK monster + 1 WIND monster in your hand is a cost.
    *   If this card is not in your Graveyard when this effect resolves, it is not Special Summoned.
*   The ④ Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   Your opponent cannot Set cards by manual player action (ex: place a Spell face-down) \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=830504)\].
    *   Your opponent cannot Special Summoning monsters face-down (ex: "The Shallow Grave") \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=520413)\].
    *   Your opponent cannot Set cards by card effect (ex: “Book of Moon”, "Scrap Iron Scarecrow") \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=830504)\].
    *   If your opponent activates “Scrap-Iron Scarecrow” when you attack with “Dark Simorgh” the attack will be negated, but “Scrap-Iron Scarecrow” will go to the Graveyard because it cannot be Set.
    *   If “Call of the Haunted” is Chained to the activation of “The Shallow Grave” and “Dark Simorgh” is Special Summoned as a result, the controller of “Dark Simorgh” will Special Summon a monster with “The Shallow Grave” but the opponent will not.

  
## DARK SNAKE SYNDROME

*   If you have multiple copies of "Dark Snake Syndrome", the effects are cumulative.
*   Both players take damage during the Standby Phase of the controller of the "Dark Snake Syndrome".
*   If "Imperial Order" is active, you still increase the damage from turn to turn for "Dark Snake Syndrome" even though no damage is dealt.

  
## DARK SPIDER

*   This effect targets.

  
## DARK SPIRIT ART - GREED

*   Tributing 1 DARK Monster is a cost to activate "Dark Spirit Art -Greed". You can Tribute a face-down DARK Monster.
*   The opponent reveals the Spell Card from their hand when "Dark Spirit Art - Greed" is resolved, if they want to negate its effect.

  
## DARK SPIRIT OF THE SILENT

*   If your opponent has only 1 monster on the field you cannot activate this card.
*   If a monster that has already attacked, or a monster targeted with the effect of "Spellbinding Circle" or "Nightmare Wheel" is targeted with the effect of "Dark Spirit of the Silent" that monster still attacks.
*   If "Zombyra the Dark" is selected with "Dark Spirit of the Silent" and you have no monsters, "Zombyra the Dark" may attack directly.
*   If "Hayabusa Knight" or "Mataza the Zapper" is selected with "Dark Spirit of the Silent" it only attacks once, but it may then attack twice per its own effect during the same Battle Phase.
*   Monsters that have a cost to attack such as "Dark Elf" that are selected with "Dark Spirit of the Silent" do not need to have their costs paid to attack.
*   If "Dark Spirit of the Silent" selects a face-up Defense Position "Crass Clown" as a target, the effect of "Crass Clown" activates when it is changed to Attack Position.

  
## DARK STRIKE FIGHTER

*   Compute damage based on the monster’s Level while it was on the field, not its level in the Graveyard or removed zone.
    *   This means you can Tribute “Embodiment of Apophis” or “Zoma the Spirit” to do 800 damage.
*   If you Tribute a face-down monster, compute damage based on the monster’s original Level printed on the card. Tributing a monster is a cost.

  
## DARK TINKER  
> ① When this card you control is sent to the Graveyard, look at the top card of your Deck. Return that card to either the top or the bottom of the Deck.

*   The ① Trigger Effect is mandatory.
    *   This effect only activates when it is sent from your side of the field to your Graveyard.
    *   This effect does not activate if “Dark Tinker” is sent to your Graveyard under your opponent's control.

  
## DARK VALKYRIA

*   While "Dark Valkyria" is an Effect Monster, you can place Spell Counters onto it with other card effects, like "Pitch-Black Power Stone" and "Apprentice Magician."
*   If "Dark Valkyria" is treated as an Effect Monster due to the effect of “Superalloy Beast Raptinus” and has a Spell Counter when "Superalloy Beast Raptinus" is removed from the field, the Spell Counter is removed because "Dark Valkyria" is changed to a Normal Monster. If "Dark Valkyria" becomes an Effect Monster again afterwards, its effect can be used once more.

  
## DARK VERGER

*   This is a Trigger Effect that activates in the Graveyard. You can Special Summon multiple “Dark Vergers” at the same time in response to 1 Normal Summon of a Plant-Type Tuner.

  
## DARK WORLD GRIMOIRE

*   "Dark World Grimoire"'s effect starts a Chain. It targets the discarded Monster Card that is selected.

  
## DARK WORLD LIGHTNING

*   The card targeted by “Dark World Lightning” must be face-down when “Dark World Lightning” resolves in order to be destroyed. If you target a face-down Spell or Trap Card, and the opponent activates it in a chain, then it will not be destroyed by “Dark World Lightning”. If you target a face-down monster, and it is flipped up in a chain by a card effect before “Dark World Lighting” resolves, the monster is not destroyed.
*   If you do not destroy the targeted face-down card with the effect of “Dark World Lightning” (such as if it is face-up as resolution, or if it is destroyed by another effect first), you do NOT discard 1 card from your hand.
*   You cannot activate this card if you have no other cards in your hand. If an effect is chained to “Dark World Lightning” that makes you discard all the cards in your hand, then the face-down target of “Dark World Lightning” will still be destroyed, even though you cannot discard 1 card.
*   Discarding 1 card is part of the effect of “Dark World Lightning”, it is not a cost. (So you can use it to activate the effects of “Dark World” monsters, for example.)

  
## "DARK WORLD" monsters (“Beiige, Vanguard of Dark World”, “Broww, Huntsman of Dark World”, “Sillva, Warlord of Dark World” and “Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World”).  
> ① If this card is discarded from the hand to the Graveyard by a card effect, \[perform action 1\]. ① If this card is discarded from the hand to the Graveyard by an opponent’s card effect, \[perform action 2\].

*   These effects will not miss timing, they are mandatory effects.
    *   If discarded by a card effect in the middle of a chain, or in the middle of a card effect like “Dragged Down into the Grave”, these effects will activate after the current chain resolves.
*   "Dark World" monsters only meet their trigger condition when they are '_discarded_' to the Graveyard.
*   These effects activate in the Graveyard, so “Skill Drain” will not negate their effects.
*   These effects can activate in the Damage Step, if discarded by the effect “Don Zaloog”.
*   "Dark World" monsters DO NOT activate when:
    *   discarded as a cost. They only activate when discarded by \[resolving a\] card effect.
    *   they are removed from play instead of going to the Graveyard (by "Dimensional Fissure").
    *   they are '_sent_' (as opposed to '_discarded_') to the Graveyard by a card effect.
*   The ① Trigger Effect of a "Dark World" monster discarded by your card effect produces a single Chain Link which would \[perform action 1\].
*   If the ① Trigger Effect is activated when discarded by the effect of an opponent’s card, both parts of the effect resolves in a single chain link.
    *   If “Divine Wrath” is chained to these effects, it will negate both parts.

  
## DARKBISHOP ARCHFIEND

*   When you have another Archfiend that can roll a die and "Darkbishop Archfiend", and the other Archfiend is targeted, you get to roll both dice, and you can choose which one to roll first.

  
## DARKBLAZE DRAGON

*   "Darkblaze Dragon"'s effect doubles its original ATK and DEF to create a new current ATK and DEF.
*   "Darkblaze Dragon"'s effect that doubles it original ATK and DEF to create a new current ATK and DEF disappears when "Darkblaze Dragon" is removed from the field or flipped face-down.
*   If "Skill Drain" is face-up on the field when "Darkblaze Dragon" is Special Summoned from the Graveyard, or if "Skill Drain" is activated after "Darkblaze Dragon" is Special Summoned from the Graveyard, "Skill Drain" will negate "Darkblaze Dragon"'s effect that doubles its original ATK and DEF to create a new current ATK and DEF. If "Skill Drain" is later negated or removed from the field, the original ATK and DEF are not doubled again.
*   If "Darkblaze Dragon" has its original ATK and DEF doubled to create a new current ATK and DEF and "Shrink" is used on the “Darkblaze Dragon”, the current ATK of "Darkblaze Dragon" becomes half of its original ATK. (its ATK would be 600 and its DEF would be 2000)

  
## DARK-EYES ILLUSIONIST

*   You can select a face-down monster.
*   When a face-down "Dark-Eyes Illusionist" is attacked and destroyed, its effect does not activate.
*   If "Royal Command" is actived after "Dark-Eyes Illusionist"'s effect resolves, "Dark-Eyes Illusionist"'s effect is negated.

  
## DARKLORD NURSE REFICULE (original name: Nurse Reficule the Fallen One)  
> ① Any effect that would cause your opponent to gain Life Points instead inflicts the same amount of damage to your opponent.

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate, it applies when the effect resolves.
    *   This deals Effect Damage, and is not the same as losing Life Points (ex: "Immortal of Thunder").
    *   This effect will not apply while "Skill Drain" negates this card's effect.
    *   "Nurse Reficule" must be face-up on the field to apply this effect.
    *   This effect does not stack. Two copies of "Nurse Reficule" will NOT cause "Upstart Goblin" to inflict 2000 points of Damage, it only converts the 1000 Life Point gain into 1000 points of damage \[[REF](http://web.archive.org/web/20080131140306/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/COMMUNITY/forums/thread/1005905.aspx)\].
*   VS. "Prime Material Dragon": if both "Nurse Reficule" and "Prime Material Dragon" are on the field when Player A's "Upstart Goblin" resolves, Player B will gain 1000 Life Points (gains / damage happen normally) \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=808154)\].
    *   These rules apply similarly to "Bad Reaction to Simochi".

  
## DARKNESS APPROACHES  
> ① Discard 2 cards from your hand. Select 1 face-up monster and flip it face-down, but do not change its battle position.

*   Discarding 2 cards is a cost. A monster is targeted at activation.
*   If an Attack Position monster is targeted, it is flipped into face-down Attack Position.
    *   A face-down Attack Position monster can be Flip Summoned in face-up Attack Position.
    *   If a face-down Attack Position monster is attacked, it is flipped into face-up Attack Position.
    *   A face-down Attack Position monster cannot declare an attack.

  
## DARKSEA FLOAT

*   This effect will activate even if this card is destroyed by a card effect while face-down.  
      
    

## DARKSEA RESCUE

*   If the Synchro Summon is negated, you do not draw 1 card.

  
## DAWNBREAK GARDNA

*   If "Dawnbreak Gardna" gains DEF from "The Reliable Guardian", etc. and then is Normal Summoned again, the DEF increase is recalculated after applying its new original DEF.

  
## DEBRIS DRAGON  
> ① When this card is Normal Summoned, you can Special Summon 1 monster with 500 or less ATK from your Graveyard in Attack Position. That monster’s effect(s) is negated. Ⓒ This card cannot be used as a Synchro Material Monster, except for the Synchro Summon of a Dragon-Type Synchro Monster. Ⓒ The other Synchro Material Monster(s) cannot be Level 4.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect follows a "When... you can" structure and can miss the timing.
    *   This effect targets the monster in the Graveyard, and will be negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   The Summoned monster can still activate its effect(s) to pay costs (ex: "Lonefire Blossom"), but it will resolve without effect.
*   This card has two Ⓒ Conditions ([Rule Effects](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Condition)) which CANNOT be negated.

  
## DECAYED COMMANDER

*   "Decayed Commander"'s card-discarding effect only activates when "Decayed Commander" attacks directly AND deals 1 or more points of Battle Damage to the opponent, so if the opponent uses "Kuriboh" or "Waboku" then "Decayed Commander"'s effect does not activate.
*   "Decayed Commander" does not activate its card-discarding effect if destroyed with "Ring of Destruction", or if it attacks a face-down monster while equipped with "Fairy Meteor Crush", or due to reflect damage from "Relinquished", etc.

  
## DECK DEVASTATION VIRUS  
> Tribute 1 DARK monster with an ATK of 2000 points or more on your side of the field. ① Check all monsters on your opponent's side of the field, your opponent's hand, and all cards he/she draws (until the end of your opponent's 3rd turn after this card's activation), and destroy all monsters with an ATK of 1500 or less.

*   This card's cost requires that the monster have 2000 or more ATK while on the field.
    *   You can Tribute a face-down DARK monster with 2000 ATK (ex: "[Fusilier Dragon, the Dual-Mode Beast](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fusilier_Dragon,_the_Dual-Mode_Beast)" is Set without Tribute).
    *   An opponent's face-down monster targeted by "[Soul Exchange](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Soul_Exchange)" cannot be Tributed.
*   The ① Effect applies a Lingering Effect to the Duel. The lingering effect does not start a chain.
    *   You only check the cards on the field and in the hand when "Deck Devastation Virus" is resolved.
    *   If you draw a Monster Card(s) with 1500 ATK or less (ex: "D.D. Crow") in your Draw Phase, it is destroyed immediately and cannot chain its effect (because this does not start a Chain).
    *   If you draw a Monster Card(s) by card effect (ex: "Allure of Darkness"), resolve that effect first, then destroy any monsters with 1500 ATK or less drawn.
    *   Monsters in the hand / face-down with "?" ATK are treated as having 0 ATK for this effect \[[1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=752404), [2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=864787)\].
    *   If "Night Assailant" in your hand is destroyed by this effect, its effect will activate.
    *   Only cards drawn are checked until the end of your opponent's third End Phase.
    *   If "Deck Devastation Virus" is activated on your turn, the "first turn" lasts until the end of your opponent’s next turn.
*   After "Deck Devastation Virus" has resolved, it will NOT destroy monsters with <1500 ATK that:
    *   are Summoned (ex: "Mist Archfiend", "Stronghold the Moving Fortress", "Goat Tokens" Special Summoned by "Scapegoat").
    *   are added to the hand (by "Reinforcement of the Army", "Monster Reincarnation").
    *   you gain control of from your opponent (by "Brain Control", "Creature Swap").
*   VS. "[Exodia the Forbidden One](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Exodia_the_Forbidden_One)":
    *   If you use two "Backup Soldier" to return all 4 limbs to your hand (they will not be destroyed since they were not drawn), and on your next turn you draw "Exodia the Forbidden One", you win the game before "Exodia the Forbidden One" is destroyed by "Deck Devastation Virus".
*   VS. "[Starlight Road](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Starlight_Road)":
    *   You CAN activate this card if at least two face-up monsters would be destroyed.
    *   You CANNOT activate this card if your two monsters that would be destroyed are face-down.
*   VS. "[My Body as a Shield](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/My_Body_as_a_Shield)":
    *   You CAN activate this card if at least one face-up monster you control would be destroyed.
    *   You CANNOT activate this card if your monster(s) that would be destroyed is face-down.

  
## DECK LOCKDOWN

*   Destroying "Deck Lockdown" during the Standby Phase does not start a Chain.
*   Monsters can be Special Summoned from the Extra Deck while “Deck Lockdown” is active.
*   "Reinforcement of the Army", the effect of "Green Gadget", etc. cannot be activated while "Deck Lockdown" is active.
*   If "Sangan" is sent from the field to the Graveyard while "Deck Lockdown" is active, its effect will start a Chain but its effect will disappear when it resolves.
*   "Crystal Seer"'s effect can activate while "Deck Lockdown" is active, but the card you would add to your hand is sent to the Graveyard instead.

  
## DECOY DRAGON

*   "Decoy Dragon"'s effect is activated during the Battle Step when it is selected as the target for your opponent's attacking monster.
*   "Decoy Dragon"'s effect does not cause a replay.
*   "Decoy Dragon" must be face-up at the time it is declared as the target of your opponent's attacking monster or its effect will not activate.
*   If you have a "Decoy Dragon" equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" and your opponent's monster declares an attack against it, the effect of "Decoy Dragon" is still activated and your opponent's attacking monster must still battle with the Level 7 or higher Dragon-Type monster that you Special Summon from your Graveyard.
*   If the Level 7 or higher Dragon-Type monster has an effect that activates when it is Special Summoned, the effect will begin a new Chain after it is Special Summoned by "Decoy Dragon". Example: If you Special Summon "Felgrand Dragon" by using "Decoy Dragon"'s effect, the effect of "Felgrand Dragon" will activate and it will be able to gain ATK.

  
## DEDICATION THROUGH LIGHT AND DARKNESS

*   "Dedication through Light and Darkness" does not target.
*   You select the "Dark Magician of Chaos" you wish to Special Summon when you resolve "Dedication through Light and Darkness", not when you activate it.
*   You can Tribute a face-down "Dark Magician" to activate "Dedication through Light and Darkness".

  
## DEEPSEA WARRIOR

*   If you take control of your opponent's face-down "Deepsea Warrior" with "Change of Heart" while "Umi" is face-up on the field, when it is flipped face-up it is immediately returned to your opponent.
*   If you Special Summon "Deepsea Warrior" with "Premature Burial", when "Premature Burial" is destroyed while "Umi" is face-up on the field "Deepsea Warrior" is not destroyed.
*   If a Spell Card is activated that would destroy a face-up "Umi" and a face-up "Deepsea Warrior" simultaneously, "Umi" is destroyed but "Deepsea Warrior" is not.
*   If your opponent has "Messenger of Peace" or "Swords of Revealing Light" face-up on their side of the field, "Deepsea Warrior" can attack if "Umi" is face-up on the field. If your opponent has "Toll", you do not pay. If your opponent has "Gravekeeper's Servant", you do not send a card from the top of your Deck to your Graveyard.
*   If "Deepsea Warrior" is equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" while "Umi" is face-up on the field, the effect of "Ring of Magnetism" is not applied.
*   If your opponent controls a monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" and another monster, you can attack the other monster with "Deepsea Warrior" if "Umi" is face-up on the field.
*   If your opponent has "The Dark Door" face-up on their side of the field, you can attack with one of your monsters and then attack with "Deepsea Warrior" if "Umi" is face-up on the field.

*   You cannot activate "Defense Draw" if there are no cards left in your Deck.
*   You cannot activate "Defense Draw" while your opponent controls a face-up "Protector of the Sanctuary".

  
## DE-FUSION

*   If you have only 1 of the Fusion Material Monsters in your Graveyard you cannot Special Summon it.
*   You may use "De-Fusion" to Special Summon "Goddess with the Third Eye" or "King of the Swamps" if it was used as a Fusion Material Monster for the Fusion Monster selected with "De-Fusion".
*   After you attack with a Fusion Monster, you may activate "De-Fusion" in the End Step of the Battle Phase to Special Summon the appropriate Fusion Material Monsters and attack with them in the same Battle Phase.
*   If you activate "De-Fusion" and select a Fusion Monster that was Special Summoned by "Magical Scientist" or "Metamorphosis" you can return the Fusion Monster to the owner’s Extra Deck, but cannot Special Summon any Fusion Material Monsters since none were used.

  
## DEKOICHI THE BATTLECHANTED LOCOMOTIVE

*   The effect of "Dekoichi the Battlechanted Locomotive" will include any of your opponent’s "Bokoichi the Freightening Car" that you control on your side of the field.
*   The number of "Bokoichi the Freightening Car" on your side of the field is counted when this card’s effect resolves. That means if it is flipped, and the opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to destroy the only "Bokoichi the Freightening Car" on your side of the field, you only draw 1 card.

  
## DELINQUENT DUO

*   This card may be activated if your opponent has only 1 card in his/her hand.

  
## DELTA ATTACKER

*   After activating "Delta Attacker", you have 3 different monsters with the same name, "Delta Attacker" still only applies to the 3 monsters of the same name you had when you activated "Delta Attacker".

*   If "Non-Spellcasting Area" is activated after "Delta Attacker", the effect of "Delta Attacker" is negated.

  
## DELTA CROW - ANTI REVERSE

*   You cannot activate “Delta Crow – Anti Reverse” from your hand if you control 4 or 5 “Blackwing” monsters.
*   If you control exactly 3 “Blackwing” monsters, you can activate “Delta Crow – Anti Reverse” from your hand during your turn or during your opponent’s turn.
*   The number of “Blackwing” monsters on the field is only an activation requirement. If the number of Blackwings is no longer correct when “Delta Crow – Anti Reverse” resolves, its effect is still applied. “Delta Crow – Anti Reverse” only destroys face-down Spell and Trap Cards. If those cards are chained in response, they are not destroyed.

  
## DEMISE OF THE LAND

*   The activated Field Spell Card does not start a Chain.

  
## DEMISE, KING OF ARMAGEDDON  
> Ⓒ This card can only be Ritual Summoned with the Ritual Spell Card, "End of the World". ① You can pay 2000 Life Points to destroy all cards on the field, except this card.

*   The Ⓒ Summoning Condition common to Ritual Monsters at the time is poorly worded.
    *   This card CAN be Ritual Summoned by "Advanced Ritual Art" or "Contract with the Abyss".
*   The ① Ignition Effect can be used many times in the same turn.
    *   This effect does not target.
    *   Paying 2000 Life Points is a cost.
    *   If "Book of Moon" is chained to flip Demise face-down, he is still not destroyed by his effect.

  
## DEMOTION

*   A monster's Level cannot go below 1. You can equip 2 "Demotions" to a monster to reduce its Level by 4.

  
## DEPTH AMULET

*   Discarding a card and negating the attack are considered to happen simultaneously.
*   Discarding 1 card is not a cost. It is part of the resolution of the effect. If your opponent’s 3rd End Phase after the activation of “Depth Amulet” is skipped for whatever reason, “Depth Amulet” will remain face-up on the field. You can only activate the effect of “Depth Amulet” once for each attack that is declared. You can flip “Depth Amulet” at any time.
*   You can only activate its effect when your opponent’s monster declares an attack.
*   You can flip “Depth Amulet” and activate its effect in the same Chain Link.
*   “Depth Amulet” targets the attacking monster.

  
## DES COUNTERBLOW

*   "Des Counterblow"'s effect does NOT target.
*   The monster is destroyed after damage calculation.

  
## DES CROAKING

*   The need for 3 “Des Frogs” is only a condition of activation. If an effect is chained that removes 1 of the 3 “Des Frogs”, the effect of “Des Croaking” still resolves normally.

  
## DES DENDLE  
> ① Once per turn, during your Main Phase, if you control this monster on the field, you can equip it to your "Vampire Orchis" as an Equip Card, OR unequip the Union equipment and Special Summon this card in face-up Attack Position. ② While equipped to a monster by this card's effect, each time the equipped monster destroys 1 of your opponent's monsters, Special Summon 1 "Wicked Plant Token" (Plant-Type/EARTH/1 Star/ATK 800/DEF 800). Ⓒ (1 monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the equipped monster is destroyed as a result of battle, destroy this card instead.)  
  
## DES FERAL IMP

*   "Des Feral Imp"'s effect targets a card in the Graveyard.

  
## DES FROG

*   The effect of “Des Frog” is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to. It activates when “Des Frog” is Tribute Summoned successfully.
*   Count the number of “T.A.D.P.O.L.E.(s)” when you resolve this effect, not when it activates.
*   If you activate the effect of “Des Frog” but have no “Des Frogs” in your hand or Deck, your opponent can check to confirm.

  
## DES KANGAROO

*   If "Hyper Hammerhead" attacks "Des Kangaroo" in Defense Position, their effects form a chain; "Hyper Hammerhead" is Step 1 because it is the turn player's effect, and "Des Kangaroo" is Step 2. "Des Kangaroo" resolves first and destroys "Hyper Hammerhead", then "Hyper Hammerhead" resolves and "Des Kangaroo" is returned to the owner's hand.

  
## DES KOALA

*   You can chain "Barrel Behind the Door" to "Des Koala"'s Flip Effect.

  
## DES WOMBAT

*   “Des Wombat” even protects you against damage from your own card effects, like “Dark Snake Syndrome” or “Ring of Destruction”.
*   “Des Wombat” even protects you against card effects where the damage is undecided at activation, like “Dice Jar”.
*   “Des Wombat” will protect you against the effect damage of “Graverobber”.
*   If your only “Des Wombat” is destroyed by “Judgment of Anubis” or “Ring of Destruction”, it is no longer on the field so it will not protect you against the damage from these card effects.

  
## DESCENDING LOST STAR

*   This card targets 1 Synchro Monster in your Graveyard. If the Synchro Monster is flipped face-down while on the field, all effects of “Descending Lost Star” are wiped. The monster’s effects are re-applied, its Level and DEF are restored, and its battle position can be changed.
*   Effects like “Chorus of Sanctuary” can increase the DEF of the monster above 0.
*   Descending Lost Star” only negates effects that apply or activate on the field.
    *   If the Synchro Monster has an effect that activates off the field, that effect is still applied.

  
## DESERT PROTECTOR

*   You can destroy 1 “Desert Protector” to save multiple Insects that would be destroyed at the same time, such as with “Nobleman-Eater Bug”.
*   You can only use 1 “Desert Protector” at a time; if 1 or more Insects are about to be destroyed, you can only destroy 1 “Desert Protector”.
*   If “Desert Protector” and your Insect(s) would be destroyed at the same time, you cannot use “Desert Protector” to save the Insect(s).

  
## DESERT SUNLIGHT

*   If you have a face-up Flip Effect monster, you can activate “Desert Sunlight”, and chain “Book of Moon”, another "Desert Sunlight", and another "Book of Moon". When the chain resolves, you will flip the monster down, then up, then down, then back up. The Flip Effect activates twice, and they wait to create a new chain after the current one resolves. For example, if the Flip Effect monster is “Morphing Jar”, its effect will activate twice in a chain, as Chain Link 1 and Chain Link 2, they resolve in reverse order, and both players will discard and draw 5 cards, then discard and draw 5 cards again.

  
## DESERT TWISTER

*   This card’s effect to destroy 1 Spell or Trap Card on the field targets.

  
## DESERTAPIR

*   You cannot select any "Desertapir" with "Desertapir"'s effect.
*   If you have "Destruction Punch" and "Desertapir" is attacked by a monster with ATK lower than "Desertapir"'s effect, and "Desertapir"'s effect flips the attacking monster face-down, the effect of "Destruction Punch" is applied and the attacking monster is destroyed.
*   If "Mystical Knight of Jackal" or "Ghost Knight of Jackal" attacks, and is flipped face-down by "Desertapir", the attacking monster is no longer face-up when "Desertapir" is sent to the Graveyard (which is when their effects activate), so their effects do not apply to "Desertapir".

  
## DESPAIR FROM THE DARK

*   "Despair from the Dark" can be Normal Summoned.
*   Only the owner of "Despair from the Dark" can use its effect, because it has to be sent from your hand to your Graveyard.
*   When you discard "Despair from the Dark" with "Painful Choice", "Despair from the Dark"'s effect does not activate because it was your own card effect that caused it.
*   If "Despair from the Dark" is sent to the Graveyard during a card effect's resolution, or during a chain, activate "Despair from the Dark"'s effect after the current effect or chain has resolved.
*   If "Despair from the Dark" is sent to the Graveyard by "Last Turn"'s effect, "Despair from the Dark" is Special Summoned to the field before the attack of "Last Turn" happens.

  
## DESROOK ARCHFIEND

*   Missing the Timing: Because "Desrook Archfiend"'s effect is optional, the "Terrorking Archfiend" being sent to the Graveyard has to be the very last thing that happened in order for you to activate "Desrook Archfiend"'s effect. You cannot activate "Desrook Archfiend"'s effect in the middle of a chain, such as if "Pot of Greed" was activated and "Ring of Destruction" was chained to destroy "Terrorking Archfiend" and send him to the Graveyard in the middle of the chain.
*   You can activate "Desrook Archfiend"'s effect when a face-down "Terrorking Archfiend" is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by a card effect.
*   "Desrook Archfiend" is a Quick Effect and can be activated during your opponent's turn, and even during the Damage Step.
*   When you control your opponent's "Terrorking Archfiend" with "Change of Heart", and it is destroyed, you can activate "Desrook Archfiend" from your hand to Special Summon the "Terrorking Archfiend" back to your side of the field.
*   While "Pandemonium" is active, and you have "Desrook Archfiend" in your hand, and your "Terrorking Archfiend" is destroyed while on the field, "Pandemonium" is Step 1 of a chain , but you can use "Desrook Archfiend" as Step 2 of the chain. Then you would get to Special Summon the "Terrorking Archfiend" and select a Level 3 or lower Archfiend from your Deck.

  
## DESTINY BOARD

*   The "proper order" in the text of "Destiny Board" means the order the Spirit Messages are placed on the field, not the order that they occupy your Spell and Trap Card Zones. So if you read your Zones from left to right as N-F-A-I-L, it is okay as long as they came on the field in the order of F-I-N-A-L.
*   If you have two copies of "Destiny Board" on the field you may place two Spirit Messages from your hand or Deck onto the field but you cannot place the fifth one until one of your two "Destiny Boards" is removed from the field.
*   If all of your Spell and Trap Card Zones are occupied during your opponent’s End Phase, you cannot use the effect of "Destiny Board" that turn.
*   If your "Destiny Board" or any of your Spirit Messages is destroyed or removed from the field, all your remaining Spirit Messages and "Destiny Boards" on the field are destroyed. If your opponent has any, they are not destroyed.
*   If "Imperial Order" is active on the field it will not stop the effect of "Destiny Board" to place Spirit Messages on the field, nor will it stop a player who completes the message from declaring victory.
*   If "Jinzo" or "Royal Decree" is on the field, "Destiny Board’s effect will be negated and you cannot place a Spirit Message on the field. Also if one of the Spirit Messages or "Destiny Board" is destroyed while "Jinzo" or "Royal Decree" is on the field, the others will NOT be destroyed. If "Jinzo" is destroyed in the End Phase you may activate "Destiny Board"’s effect afterwards.
*   "Cold Wave" will prevent the effect of "Destiny Board" to bring a Spirit Message to the field for the turn "Cold Wave" is activated.
*   The placing of a Spirit Message on the field by the effect of "Destiny Board" cannot be negated with "Magic Jammer", "Magic Drain", "Solemn Judgment", etc.
*   If you have a Spirit Message in your hand you cannot activate it, they can only be placed on the field by the effect of "Destiny Board" during your opponent’s End Phase.

## DESTINY HERO - CAPTAIN TENACIOUS

*   This effect does not activate when your “Destiny Hero” monster is destroyed. This effect activates during your Standby Phase, so “Destiny Hero - Captain Tenacious” must be face-up on your side of the field at that time to Special Summon the “Destiny Hero” monster.
*   "Destiny Hero - Captain Tenacious" must be on your side of the field when the other "Destiny Hero" monster you control is destroyed by battle, and must remain on your side of the field until your following Standby Phase.

    *   VS. "Drastic Drop Off": Your turn player priority allows Dasher's effect to be Chain Link 1. However, your opponent can chain "Drastic Drop Off" to discard the Monster Card you drew.

  
## DESTINY HERO - DEFENDER

*   "Destiny Hero - Departed"'s first effect is a Trigger Effect. It is not optional.
*   "Destiny Hero - Departed"'s effect is not activated while "King Tiger Wanghu" is face-up on the field because an infinite loop would result. If "Destiny Hero - Departed"'s ATK would become greater than 1400 when Special Summoned, because of another card's effect, it is Special Summoned.

  
## DESTINY HERO - DIAMOND DUDE  
> ① Once per turn, you can reveal the top card of your Deck. If it is a Normal Spell Card, send it to the Graveyard and you can activate its effect during the Main Phase of your next turn. If the card is not a Normal Spell Card, place it on the bottom of your Deck.

    *   General Activation requirements are bypassed (ex: controlling a face-up "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" in order to activate "Burst Stream of Destruction").
    *   Timing Activation requirements cannot be bypassed. "[Curse of Fiend](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Card_Rulings:Curse_of_Fiend#Previously_Official_Rulings)" can only be activated during the Standby Phase, and thus its effect cannot be activated by Diamond Dude. "[Cold Wave](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cold_Wave)"'s effect can be activated so long as it is the first action you take in the Main Phase 1 \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=411261)\].

*   VS. "[Gold Sarcophagus](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Gold_Sarcophagus)":You can remove from play 1 card in your Deck, but it will not be added to your hand since "Gold Sarcophagus" itself was never activated (played face-up), only its effect.
*   VS. "[Different Dimension Capsule](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Different_Dimension_Capsule)": You can remove from play face-down 1 card in your Deck, but it will not be added to your hand since "Different Dimension Capsule" did not destroy itself by its own effect.

*   "Destruction Jammer" cannot be chained to the activation of the Ignition-like effect of a Continuous Spell or Trap Card (like "Skull Lair", etc.).

*   “Diamond-Dust Cyclone” cannot be activated while there are no cards remaining in your Deck.
*   If “Diamond-Dust Cyclone” fails to destroy the selected monster (because the monster was removed from the field, etc.), you will not draw card(s) from your Deck.
*   If you select a monster with “Diamond-Dust Cyclone” and the selected monster is flipped face-down in chain, the monster will still be destroyed but you will not draw any card(s) because the Fog Counters are removed when the selected monster is flipped face-down.

*   If one player has no monsters on the field, you cannot activate "Different Dimension Gate".
*   The controller of "Different Dimension Gate" selects both monsters.
*   A monster removed with "Different Dimension Gate" doesn't take up a Monster Zone, but if there are no vacant Monster Zones when it returns to play, it is sent to the Graveyard.
*   If a face-down monster is selected for this effect, it will remain face-down while removed from play. So if a face-down “D.D. Scout Plane” is removed from play with this card, its effect will not activate.
*   When a monster removed with "Different Dimension Gate" is sent to the Graveyard with "Miracle Dig", the monster won't return to the field when "Different Dimension Gate" is destroyed, but the other monster removed with "Different Dimension Gate" will still return to the field.
*   When a Spirit Monster is removed with "Different Dimension Gate", if it returns to play after the turn it was Summoned or Flip Summoned, it doesn't go back to the owner's hand.

*   When your opponent's monster on your side of the field that you control with "Change of Heart" or "Snatch Steal" is removed with "Different Dimension Gate", it returns to your side of the field when "Different Dimension Gate" is destroyed, and then immediately returns to your opponent's side of the field.
*   You can select a Monster Token when you activate "Different Dimension Gate", but the token is taken off the field.
*   If your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to your "Different Dimension Gate", only the surviving monster is removed from play and returns when "Different Dimension Gate" is destroyed.
*   When a Fusion Monster that was Special Summoned with "Summoner of Illusions" or "Magical Scientist" is removed from play with "Different Dimension Gate", it is not destroyed or returned to the Extra Deck when it returns to the field, and it no longer has "Magical Scientist’s” restriction that prevents it from attacking your opponent's Life Points directly.
*   When you select "Guardian Kay'est" or "The Legendary Fisherman" as a target of "Different Dimension" gate, only the other monster is removed and returns to the field when "Different Dimension Gate" is destroyed.
*   You can only use "Different Dimension Gate’s” effect when it is activated, even though it is a Continuous Spell Card.

  
## DIFFUSION WAVE-MOTION

*   You cannot use "Diffusion Wave-Motion" and select a Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster that was Summoned this turn with "Tribute Doll" because it cannot attack that turn due to "Tribute Doll"'s effect.
*   After you activate "Diffusion Wave-Motion", if all monsters on your opponent's side of the field are destroyed (with "Raigeki", etc.) then your selected Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster can attack your opponent's Life Points directly.
*   When you activate "Diffusion Wave-Motion", and your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to destroy your selected Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster, the effect of "Diffusion Wave-Motion" is negated and your other monsters can attack normally that turn. But, if your opponent activates "Ring of Destruction" AFTER "Diffusion Wave-Motion" resolves (with no chain), and the selected Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster is destroyed, your other monsters CANNOT attack.
*   If your opponent activates "Amazoness Archers" when your selected Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster attacks, only the Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster can attack because of "Diffusion Wave-Motion"'s effect, so your other monsters do not attack, but the -500 ATK effect of "Amazoness Archers" is still applied to all of your monsters.
*   If you Special Summon a monster during the Battle Phase after having activated "Diffusion Wave-Motion" (such as with "De-Fusion" or "Call of the Haunted"), that monster cannot attack because "Diffusion Wave-Motion"'s effect prevents all monsters other than the selected Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster from attacking.
*   Your Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster selected with "Diffusion Wave-Motion" must attack each monster on your opponent's side of the field, 1 at a time.
*   After destroying all of your opponent's monsters, your Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster cannot then attack your opponent's Life Points directly.
*   If your Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster selected with "Diffusion Wave-Motion" has 1 of its attacks negated by "Magic Cylinder", that attack is negated but your Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster still attacks everything else.
*   If your Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster equipped with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light-Tryce" is selected with "Diffusion Wave-Motion", if it has attacked 2 different monsters using "Diffusion Wave-Motion"'s effect, it no longer gets the second attack from "Twin Swords of Flashing Light-Tryce"'s effect because it has already attacked twice.
*   If an opponent's monster is equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", your Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster selected with "Diffusion Wave-Motion" must attack that monster. If the monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" is not destroyed (such as if it is also equipped with "Heart of Clear Water"), you cannot attack any of your opponent's other monsters.
*   If you activate "Diffusion Wave-Motion", and your opponent activates "Staunch Defender", only the Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster can attack, and it must attack the target of "Staunch Defender", and it cannot attack any other monsters.
*   When a Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster selected with "Diffusion Wave-Motion" attacks "Amazoness Fighter" or "Amazoness Swordswoman", their effects are still applied normally at damage calculation.
*   You can activate "Injection Fairy Lily"'s effect when she is attacked by a Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster selected with "Diffusion Wave-Motion" because her effect is applied during damage calculation.
*   When a Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster selected with "Diffusion Wave-Motion" attacks "Spirit Reaper" or "Kisetai", it cannot destroy "Spirit Reaper" or "Kisetai" (so "Kisetai"'s effect is not negated).
*   A Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster selected with "Diffusion Wave-Motion" will negate: the Flip Effects of a monster it destroys as a result of battle, or the effects of "Giant Rat", "Sangan", "Dark Necrofear", "Sinister Serpent", "D. D. Warrior Lady", "Wall of Illusion", "Helpoemer", "Marie the Fallen One", etc.

  
## DIMENSION DISTORTION

*   Your Graveyard only has to be empty when you activate "Dimension Distortion", so if an effect is chained that puts a card in your Graveyard, "Dimension Distortion" still resolves.
*   "Dimension Distortion" can only Special Summon a monster that is face-up while removed from play (cannot Special Summon a monster removed with "Lightforce Sword" or "Different Dimension Capsule").
*   "Dimension Distortion" can Special Summon "Dark Ruler Ha Des".
*   When a "Special Summon-only" monster is removed, without returning to the hand or Deck, after it is Special Summoned properly, it can be Special Summoned by "Dimension Distortion".

  
## DIMENSION EXPLOSION  
> Return 1 face-up Fusion Monster you control to the Fusion Deck. ① Both players select up to 2 of their monsters that are removed from play, and Special Summon them.

*   Returning 1 face-up Fusion Monster you control to the Extra Deck is a cost.
*   This card targets removed from play monsters for both players.
*   This card CANNOT be activated unless both players have at least 1 removed from play monster.
*   This card CANNOT be activated unless both players have at least 1 open Monster Card Zone.

  
## DIMENSION FORTRESS WEAPON

*   Costs cannot be paid while “Dimension Fortress Weapon” is on the field, if the cost is to send cards from the Deck to the Graveyard. So “Card Trooper” and “Celestia, Lightsworn Angel” cannot activate their effects.
    *   In general, Lightsworn monsters can activate their effects while “Dimension Fortress Weapon” is on the field, but cards are not sent from the Deck to the Graveyard afterwards.
    *   If “Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter” is flipped face-up while “Dimension Fortress Weapon” is on the field, you can destroy 1 card with its effect, but no cards are sent from the Deck to the Graveyard after that. “Solar Recharge” cannot be activated while “Dimension Fortress Weapon” is on the field.
    *   If “Solar Recharge” is activated and “Dimension Fortress Weapon” is Summoned in a chain, draw 2 cards, but do not send 2 cards from the Deck to the Graveyard after that.
*   If a card needs to be sent from the Deck to the Graveyard because of a card combination that renders the usual resolution impossible, that card is still sent to the Graveyard even if “Dimension Fortress Weapon” is on the field.
    *   Example #1: If “Dimension Fortress Weapon” is on the field and you activate “Conscription”, and pick up a monster that could be Normal Summoned, but your Monster Card Zones are full, the monster is sent to the Graveyard.
    *   Example #2: The same is true for extra monsters from “Enchanting Fitting Room” that cannot be Summoned due to lack of available Monster Card Zones.
    *   Example #3: “Crystal Seer” is flipped face-up while “Thunder King Rai-Oh” is on the field. “Reasoning” and “Monster Gate” cannot be activated while “Dimension Fortress Weapon” is on the field. If their effects were activated and “Dimension Fortress Weapon” was Summoned in a chain, their effects are not applied. “Null and Void” cannot be activated while “Dimension Fortress Weapon” is on the field.
*   If “Null and Void” is activated, and “Dimension Fortress Weapon” is Summoned in a chain, add the drawn cards to the hand after both players see them.
*   “Destiny Hero – Diamond Dude” cannot activate its effect while “Dimension Fortress Weapon” is on the field. If its effect is activated and “Dimension Fortress Weapon” is Summoned in a chain, the effect is not applied (do not check the top card of the Deck).
*   “Future Fusion” cannot be activated while “Dimension Fortress Weapon” is on the field. If “Future Fusion” is activated, and “Dimension Fortress Weapon” is Summoned in a chain, the effect of “Future Fusion” is not applied, no monsters are sent to the Graveyard, no Fusion Monster is Special Summoned, and “Future Fusion” remains on the field meaninglessly.
*   If “Magical Merchant” is flipped face-up while “Dimension Fortress Weapon” is on the field, its effect is not applied.
*   If “Chain Destruction” is activated while “Dimension Fortress Weapon” is on the field, copies of the monster in the player’s hand are destroyed, but not copies in their Deck.
*   If “Spell Vanishing” is activated while “Dimension Fortress Weapon” is on the field, check the opponent’s hand and Deck, and send copies of the Spell Card in their hand to the Graveyard, but not the copies from their Deck.

  
## DIMENSION FUSION

*   "Dimension Fusion" cannot Special Summon a "Special Summon-only" monster, like a Ritual Monster or "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End", unless it was properly summoned first.
*   You cannot activate "Dimension Fusion" when neither player has a monster removed from play; at least 1 player must have at least 1 monster removed from play for you to activate it.
*   "Dimension Fusion" does not target.
*   You can use "Dimension Fusion" to Special Summon a monster removed from play with "Different Dimension Gate".
*   You cannot use "Dimension Fusion" to Special Summon a monster that was removed from play and kept face-down, like with "Lightforce Sword" or "Different Dimension Capsule".
*   If you take control of your opponent's monster, and it is removed from play while on your side of the field with "Dimensionhole", when "Dimension Fusion" resolves the monster is Special Summoned to the player's side of the field who controlled the monster when it was removed.
*   Dimension Fusion can Special Summon "Dark Ruler Ha Des" or "Helpoemer".
*   You can activate "Bottomless Trap Hole" after monsters are Summoned with "Dimension Fusion"; "Bottomless Trap Hole" destroys the Summoned monsters on your opponent's side of the field, and your Summoned monsters are not destroyed.

  
## DIMENSION JAR

*   This card should say "FLIP: Both players can remove from play up to 3 cards from their opponent's Graveyard.", not "up to 3 monsters".
*   You can use "Dimension Jar"'s effect for zero to three cards, so even if your opponent has less than 3 cards in his Graveyard you can still use "Dimension Jar"'s effect.
*   When "Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer" is on the field and "Dimension Jar" is activated, the controller of "Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer" can remove their opponent's cards in the Graveyard from play.

  
## DIMENSION WALL

*   The effect of “Dimension Wall” is applied during damage calculation and cannot be chained to.
*   If your opponent already activated “Waboku” this turn, then they cannot take battle damage, so you cannot activate “Dimension Wall”. However, you can chain “Dimension Wall” to “Waboku” if the timing is appropriate.
*   If “Don Zaloog” attacks and “Dimension Wall” is used, neither player gets the effect of “Don Zaloog”.
*   “Dimension Wall” is not an effect that targets.

  
## DIMENSIONAL ALCHEMIST  
> ① Once per turn, you can remove from play the top card of your Deck; this card gains 500 ATK until the End Phase. ② When this card is destroyed and sent from your side of the field to the Graveyard, you can select 1 of your removed from play monsters and return it to your hand.

*   The ① Ignition Effect resolves even if "Dimensional Alchemist" is flipped face-down / leaves the field.
    *   Remove from play the top card of your Deck when the effect resolves, NOT as a cost \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=841434), [REF2](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/118829-dimensional-alchemist-vs-skill-drain/)\].
    *   The card is removed from play face-up, and "Dimensional Alchemist" simultaneously gains 500 ATK.
*   The ② Optional "_When \[...\] you can_" Trigger Effect can miss the timing.
    *   This effect can activate in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step when it is sent to the Graveyard.
    *   This effect can activate when the last thing to happen in Chain Link 1 was this card's destruction.
    *   This effect cannot activate if this card was destroyed as Chain Link 2+.
    *   This effect cannot activate if this card was removed from play, it must be sent to the Graveyard.

  
## DIMENSIONAL FISSURE  
> ① Any monster sent to the Graveyard is removed from play instead.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect only affects Monster Cards that would be sent to the Graveyard.
    *   Face-down monsters that would be sent to the Graveyard are also removed from play.
    *   Cards/effects whose cost send/discard a monster(s) '_to the Graveyard_' CANNOT activate.
        *   Examples: "Herald of Orange Light", "Card Trooper", and "Jowgen the Spiritualist".
    *   Cards/effects whose cost send/discard a monster(s) CAN activate.
        *   Example: "Magic Jammer", "Dark Grepher".
    *   Cards/effects that send/discard a monster(s) '_to the Graveyard_' at resolution CAN activate.
        *   Examples: "Foolish Burial", "Blaze Accelerator", and "Needlebug Nest".
*   VS. "Archlord Kristya": If a face-up Kristya would be sent from the field to the Graveyard (and removed from play), its effect will still trigger and places it back on top of the Deck.

  
## DIMENSIONAL INVERSION

*   If multiple monsters you control are being removed from play simultaneously, you can still activate “Dimensional Inversion”. Select 1 of those monsters to be Special Summoned.
*   If your opponent controls “Macro Cosmos”, “Banisher of the Light”, etc., and an effect is activated by either player that sends a monster to the Graveyard, you can activate “Dimensional Inversion”. This is because your monster is being removed from play (instead of being sent to the Graveyard) by the effect of your opponent’s card.
*   If both players control “Macro Cosmos”, etc., and a monster is sent to the Graveyard, assume that the turn player’s effect is the one that removes it from play. So in this case, the opponent can activate “Dimensional Inversion” but the turn player cannot.
*   You cannot activate “Dimensional Inversion” when a Trap Monster like “Embodiment of Apophis” is removed from play.
*   You can activate “Dimensional Inversion” even when a monster is removed from play temporarily. For example, if your monster is controlled by your opponent, and your opponent uses “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” on it, you can activate “Dimensional Inversion”.
*   If a card is removed from play with “Lightforce Sword” or “Different Dimension Capsule”, you cannot activate “Dimensional Inversion” because you cannot verify the card is a monster.
*   You cannot activate "Dimensional Inversion" during the Damage Step.

  
## DIMENSIONAL PRISON  
> Activate only when your opponent declares an attack. Remove from play the attacking monster.

*   This card targets the attacking monster.
*   You cannot choose to activate cards/effects like "Dimensional Prison" while "Imperial Iron Wall" is active.
*   If "Imperial Iron Wall" is chained to such a card/effect, then no card is removed from play.
*   If "Book of Moon" is used on an attacking monster, then that monster is no longer considered to be an attacking monster. Thus, if "Book of Moon" is Chained to an effect like "Dimensional Prison" or "Sakuretsu Armor" and changes the monster to face-down Defense Position, then the effect of "Sakuretsu Armor" does not resolves, so the attacking monster is not destroyed (or removed from play, and so on).
*   If something like "Enemy Controller" is Chained to something like "Sakuretsu Armor" or "Dimensional Prison" so that control of the attacking monster changes, then the effect of "Sakuretsu Armor" does not destroy the attacking monster.
*   If the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" is activated when a monster declares an attack, then the Battle Phase ends, so the attacking monster can no longer be treated as an "attacking monster".
    *   If the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" is activated in Chain to an effect like "Sakuretsu Armor" or "Dimensional Prison", then the effect of "Sakuretsu Armor" is not applied, and the attacking monster remains on the field.
    *   If the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" is activated in Chain to "Magic Cylinder", then the Battle Phase ends, so "Magic Cylinder" cannot negate the attack so the effect of inflicting damage equal to the monster's ATK is not applied.
    *   The effect of "Mirror Force" only destroys all monsters in Attack Position, so all Attack Position monsters will still be destroyed even if the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" ends the Battle Phase.

  
## DIMENSIONHOLE

*   If your following Standby Phase is skipped, the removed monster remains in the Removed Zone.
*   If you control your opponent's monster with "Brain Control" or "Snatch Steal" and you remove it from play with "Dimensionhole", during your following Standby Phase when the monster is returned to your side of the field it is immediately moved to your opponent's side of the field.

  
## DISAPPEAR

*   When a card that selects a card in the Graveyard as a target, such as "Monster Reborn", "Mask of Darkness", "Magician of Faith", "Spear Cretin", or "The Shallow Grave", is activated, you may chain "Disappear" to remove the targeted card from play, and the "Monster Reborn", etc., will resolve without effect. This is because these cards select their target at activation, not resolution.
*   "Bazoo the Soul Eater" removes a monster in the Graveyard as a cost, so you cannot chain "Disappear" to the effect of "Bazoo the Soul Eater" to negate it. The monster is already removed from play before you can activate "Disappear".
*   If you chain "Disappear" to your opponent’s "Backup Soldier" you can remove one of the targeted monsters from play, but the remaining two (or less) go to the opponent’s hand.

  
## DISARM

*   The “Gladiator Beast” monster returned to the Deck is returned to the Deck when “Disarm” is resolved. It is not a cost. You must show the “Gladiator Beast” to your opponent when resolving “Disarm’s” effect.
*   You cannot activate “Disarm” if you do not have a “Gladiator Beast” monster in your hand.

  
## DISARMAMENT

*   "Disarmament" will not destroy face-down Equip Spell Cards.

  
## DISC FIGHTER

*   You destroy a monster with "Disc Fighter"'s effect during the "calculate damage" portion but before the "apply damage" portion of damage calculation; which effectively means it's right before the actual "damage calculation".
*   When "Disc Fighter" attacks a face-down monster, after it is flipped face-up you can use "Micro Ray" to cause the DEF to go below 2000, and the monster will not be destroyed by "Disc Fighter"'s effect. Or, you can use "The Reliable Guardian" to increase the DEF of a monster above 2000 so that it will be destroyed with "Disc Fighter"'s effect.
*   The Defense Position monster is destroyed by "Disc Fighter"'s effect, not by damage calculation or "as a result of battle".
*   If "Final Attack Orders" is active, a monster attacked by "Disc Fighter" and flipped face-up will shift to Attack Position, so it will not be destroyed by "Disc Fighter"'s effect.

  
## DISCIPLE OF THE FORBIDDEN SPELL

*   Choosing Attributes is a Trigger Effect that activates when “Disciple of the Forbidden Spell” is Summoned. Your opponent could chain “Disappear” to remove from play 1 “Disciple of the Forbidden Spell” in the Graveyard and you would choose 1 less Attribute.
*   If “Chain Destruction” is chained to the Trigger Effect when “Disciple of the Forbidden Spell” is Summoned, “Chain Destruction” will resolve first, so all your copies of “Disciple of the Forbidden Spell” will be in the Graveyard, and you choose a number of Attributes equal to the new amount.
*   If you have 2 copies of this card in the Graveyard when you Summon it, you must choose 2 different Attributes.
*   The effect of “Disciple of the Forbidden Spell” is activated at the start of the Damage Step, before the attacked monster is flipped face-up. If this card attacks a face-down monster, it will not be destroyed by this effect, even if it is revealed to have 1 of the chosen Attributes.
*   If LIGHT was a chosen Attribute, and “Disciple of the Forbidden Spell” attacks “Reflect Bounder”, “Reflect Bounder’s” effect will not activate and no damage will be inflicted.

  
## DISCORD

*   Sending this card to the Graveyard during your 3rd End Phase after activation does not start a Chain.
*   You can activate the effect of “Blackwing – Vayu the Emblem of Honor” while “Discord” is active to Special Summon a Synchro Monster because it is not a Synchro Summon.
*   You cannot activate “Urgent Tuning” while “Discord” is active because it lets you perform a Synchro Summon.
*   If “Discord” is Chained to the activation of “Urgent Tuning” the effect of “Urgent Tuning” is not applied and no monsters are sent to the Graveyard.

  
## DISKBLADE RIDER

*   Removing 1 Normal Trap Card from play is not a cost. "Diskblade Rider"'s effect targets 1 Normal Trap Card in your Graveyard.

  
## DISTURBANCE STRATEGY

*   You can chain "Disturbance Strategy" to a Ritual Spell Card and then, if your opponent no longer has the Ritual Monster Card in hand when the Ritual Spell Card resolves, then the effect of the Ritual Spell Card disappears.
*   You can also chain "Disturbance Strategy" to "Polymerization" and, if the opponent no longer has the Fusion Material Monsters (if they were in his hand for example) then the effect of "Polymerization" disappears.

  
## DIVINE DRAGON - EXCELION

*   Choosing effects when “Divine Dragon – Excelion” is Summoned is a Trigger Effect. Your opponent can chain “Disappear” to remove from play 1 “Divine Dragon – Excelion” in your Graveyard, and you will choose 1 less effect.
*   If “Chain Destruction” is chained to the Trigger Effect when “Divine Dragon – Excelion” is Summoned, “Chain Destruction” will resolve first, so all your copies of “Divine Dragon – Excelion” will be in the Graveyard and you choose a number of effects equal to the new amount.

  
## DIVINE GRACE - NORTHWEMKO

*   This effect targets. If “Divine Grace – Northwemko” and one of the cards targeted by its effect are destroyed at the same time, “Divine Grace – Northwemko” will not be destroyed. If there are fewer other face-up cards on the field than monsters Tributed for the Ritual Summon of this card, all other face-up cards are targeted. Tokens used for the Ritual Summon of this card count towards its effect. “Divine Grace – Northwemko” continuously targets the selected cards.

  
## DIVINE DRAGON AQUABIZARRE

*   Tributing 1 WATER monster is a cost to activate this effect. This effect targets 1 Continuous or Field Spell Card in your Graveyard.

  
## DIVINE WRATH  
> Discard 1 card from your hand. Negate the activation of an Effect Monster's effect, and destroy that Effect Monster.

*   This card can be activated any time during the turn, including the Damage Step and end of turn discard.
*   If an attacking monster or the monster being attacked is destroyed by this card, no replay occurs. If damage calculation has not been performed yet, it is not performed.
*   This card will only negate the activation of the monster Effect that preceeds it in the Chain.
*   This card can negate the effect of a Spirit Monster that returns it to its owner’s hand.
*   If this card negates "Treeborn Frog"'s effect, its effect can be activated again in that Standby Phase.
*   This card cannot negate the effect of an equipped Union Monster that would Special Summon itself as a monster, because that is an effect of an Equip Spell Card.
*   This card cannot negate a monster's Continuous Effect, such as "Goblin Attack Force" going to Defense Position after declaring an attack, as these effects do not activate.

  
## DJINN PRESIDER OF RITUALS

*   If “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” copies the name and effect of this card and is used for a Ritual Summon, you will not be able to draw when the Ritual Monster destroys a monster by battle.
*   The effect to draw when the Ritual Monster destroys a monster by battle is applied even if “Skill Drain” is active.
*   If the Ritual Monster Summoned using this card as one of the Tributes battles a monster with the same ATK, you cannot draw with this effect.
*   Even if you remove more than 1 copy of this card for the Ritual Summon of a Ritual Monster you will only draw 1 card each time that Ritual Monster destroys a monster by battle.
*   The effect to draw a card does not start a Chain. It occurs when the monster destroyed by battle is sent to the Graveyard.
*   If the Ritual Monster that was Ritual Summoned using this card is flipped face-down, this card’s effect is no longer applied.
*   If you remove this card from play for the Ritual Summon of “Divine Grace – Northwemko” it counts towards the number of cards you can select for the effect of “Divine Grace – Northwemko.”

  
## DJINN PROGNOSTICATOR OF RITUALS

*   When you Ritual Summon a Ritual Monster, you can remove from play this card from your Graveyard as 1 of the monsters required for the Ritual Summon.
*   When the monster Ritual Summoned using this card inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent, your opponent must select and discard 1 card.If you use this card for the Ritual Summon of “Lycanthrope” and inflict Battle Damage with “Lycanthrope,” your opponent discards a card and then the effect of “Lycanthrope” activates.
*   The effect to force your opponent to discard does not start a Chain.

  
## DJINN RELEASER OF RITUALS  
> ① When you Ritual Summon a Ritual Monster, you can remove from play this card from your Graveyard as 1 of the monsters required for the Ritual Summon. ② While the monster Ritual Summoned using this card is face-up on the field, your opponent cannot Special Summon.

*   The ① Unclassified Effect cannot be negated.

    *   This card in your Graveyard can be used even if you have no monsters to Tribute for a Ritual Summon.
    *   This effect can be used while “Mask of Restrict” applies, but monsters cannot be Tributed.
    *   This card CANNOT be used for a Ritual Summon conducted with “Advanced Ritual Art.”
    *   This card can only be used as 1 of the Tributes for a Ritual Summon, regardless of whether you Tribute it normally or remove it from play.
    *   If you remove this card from play for the Ritual Summon of “Divine Grace – Northwemko” it counts towards the number of cards you can select for the effect of “Divine Grace – Northwemko.”
    *   If “D.D. Crow” is Chained to a Ritual Spell removing this card in your Graveyard from play, the Ritual Spell resolves normally and you will Tribute monsters you control or monsters in your hand. If you do not have the required monsters, your opponent verifies your hand and Set monsters.
*   The ② Unclassified Effect applies whether tributed from hand/field or banished from the Graveyard.
    *   The opponent of the player who Summoned the Ritual Monster cannot Special Summon
    *   This imparted effect applies even if "Skill Drain" is active.

Ⓒ (A monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the equipped monster would be destroyed by battle, destroy this card instead.)

*   While “Non-Spellcasting Area” is active and “Doitsu” is equipped to “Soitsu”, the increase to ATK is not applied. However, the effect that destroys “Doitsu” instead of “Soitsu” is not an effect that “Soitsu” gets, so that effect is applied normally. Also, the effect of “Doitsu” that allows it to unequip and be Special Summoned is applied normally.

  
## DOMINO EFFECT

*   "Domino Effect"'s effect starts a Chain. Sending 1 monster you control to the Graveyard is a cost.

## DOOM SHAMAN  
> ① This card is treated as a Normal Monster while face-up on the field or in the Graveyard. Ⓒ While this card is face-up on the field, you can Normal Summon it to have it be treated as an Effect Monster with this effect:  
● ② Once per turn, you can Special Summon 1 Fiend-Type monster from your hand or from either player's Graveyard. ③ When this card is removed from the field, destroy all Fiend-Type monsters Special Summoned by this effect.

*   The ① unclassified effect does not apply while "Il Blud" is in the Deck. It cannot be negated.
*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated.
    *   The additional Normal Summon does not start a chain. "Torrential Tribute" can also activate.
*   The ② Ignition Effect can Special Summon from the hand or either Graveyard.
    *   This effect continuously targets the Special Summoned monster(s) on the field.
    *   This effect does not target a monster in the Graveyard. It is not negated by "Necrovalley".

## DOOMCALIBER KNIGHT  
> Ⓒ This card cannot be Special Summoned. ① When an Effect Monster’s effect is activated, you must Tribute this card. Negate that effect’s activation, and destroy the monster.

*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated.
*   The ① mandatory Quick Effect MUST activate whenever its activation requirement is met.
    *   This effect will even activate during the Damage Step, even if "Doomcaliber Knight" is destroyed by battle and an Effect Monster's effect activates in any Substep after Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.
    *   Tributing this card is a cost. This effect CANNOT activate while "Mask of Restrict" is active.
    *   This effect will negate whichever monster effect preceeds it in the chain, even if that effect would do nothing (ex: "Magician of Faith" is Flipped while that Player has no Spell Cards in their Graveyard).
*   Example 1: Player A Tributes their "Sangan" to Summon "Zaborg the Thunder Monarch".
    *   Chain Link 1 = "Sangan", Chain Link 2 = Zaborg, and Chain Link 3 = Doomcal. Thus, Doomcal will negate and destroy Zaborg, and Sangan resolves successfully.
*   Example 2: "Blackwing - Blizzard the Far North" is Normal Summoned while "Black Whirlwind" is active.
    *   If Chain Link 1 = "Black Whirlwind", Chain Link 2 = Blizzard, and Chain Link 3 = Doomcal, then Doomcal will negate Blizzard's effect and destroy it while "Black Whirlwind" resolves without effect.
    *   If Chain Link 1 = Blizzard, Chain Link 2 = "Black Whirlwind", and Chain Link 3 = Doomcal, then Doomcal will resolve without effect but Whirlwind and Blizzard will resolve successfully.
*   If multiple "Doomcaliber Knights" are face-up on the field, and a monster activates its effect: they will all Tribute themselves as separate chain links, however, only the Doomcal chained directly onto that monster effect will successfully negate that effect.
    *   Example: Player A controls 2 "Doomcaliber Knights". Player B activates an Effect Monster's effect. Both of Player A's "Doomcaliber Knight" activate and form a Chain:
        *   Chain Link 1 = Effect Monster, Chain Link 2 = Doomcal A, Chain Link 3 = Doomcal B
        *   Only "Doomcaliber Knight" A negates the Effect Monster's effect.
*   VS. "Kuriboh": If an attacking "Doomcaliber Knight" is Tributed to negate "Kuriboh"'s effect, then damage has already been calculated. If "Doomcaliber Knight" was attacking a monster with equal or lower ATK that monster will be destroyed, and Battle Damage will be inflicted as normal.
*   Example 1: Player A Tributes her "Sangan" and "Witch of the Black Forest" to Tribute Summon "Dark Magician". "Sangan’s" effect is Chain Link 1 and "Witch of the Black Forest’s" effect is Chain Link 2. The effect of Player B's "Doomcaliber Knight" is chained, and it will negate "Witch of the Black Forest"'s effect.
*   Example 2: Player A and Player B have "Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World" in their hand and Player A controls "Doomcaliber Knight". Player A activates "Card Destruction". When both copies of "Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World" are discarded, their effects start a Chain. Player A is the turn player, so his "Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World" is Chain Link 1 and Player B's is Chain Link 2. "Doomcaliber Knight"'s effect is chained, and it will negate Player B's "Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World".
*   Example 3: Player A's "Giant Rat" is destroyed in battle and sent to the Graveyard while she has "Green Baboon, Defender of the Forest" in her hand and "Doomcaliber Knight" is face-up on the field. Player A can activate "Giant Rat" and/or "Green Baboon, Defender of the Forest"'s effect. If she activates both effects, she chooses the order the effects are placed onto the Chain, and "Doomcaliber Knight" will negate the effect that is placed highest on the Chain. If "Green Baboon, Defender of the Forest" is Chain Link 1 and "Giant Rat" is Chain Link 2, "Doomcaliber Knight" will negate "Giant Rat".
*   Example 4: If "Sangan" is Tributed to Tribute Summon "Raiza the Storm Monarch" while "Doomcaliber Knight" is face-up on the field, "Sangan"'s effect is Chain Link 1 and "Raiza the Storm Monarch"'s effect is Chain Link 2. "Doomcaliber Knight"'s effect is chained, negating "Raiza the Storm Monarch"'s effect and destroying it.
*   Example 5: Player A's "Sasuke Samurai #4" attacks Player B's "Neo-Spacian Grand Mole" while "Doomcaliber Knight" is face-up on the field. "Sasuke Samurai #4"'s effect is Chain Link 1 and "Neo-Spacian Grand Mole" is Chain Link 2. "Doomcaliber Knight"'s effect is chained, and it will negate and destroy "Neo-Spacian Grand Mole".

  
## DOOMKAISER DRAGON  
> ① When this card is Special Summoned, you can select 1 Zombie-Type monster in your opponent's Graveyard and Special Summon it to your side of the field in Attack Position. Ⓒ Destroy it when this card is removed from the field.

*   The ① effect targets 1 Zombie-Type monster in either Graveyard.
    *   This effect continuous to target the Special Summoned monster while it is on the field.
    *   If "Doomkaiser Dragon" is flipped face-down before this effect resolves, the target is still Special Summoned and it is no longer targeted by "Doomkaiser Dragon" while on the field.
*   The Ⓒ Condition destroys the Summoned monster immediately. This does not start a Chain.
    *   If this card is destroyed while resolving an effect in the Chain, destroy the Special Summoned monster immediately before resolving the next effect in the Chain.

  
## DOOMKAISER DRAGON/ASSAULT MODE

*   You can, for example, Summon 1 Zombie from your opponent’s Graveyard, and 2 from yours, etc.
*   This effect targets 1 or more monsters in the Graveyard(s).
*   After the Zombie(s) are Summoned, they are no longer targeted by “Doomkaiser Dragon/Assault Mode”.
*   Even if “Doomkaiser Dragon/Assault Mode” is removed from the field, those Zombies’ effects are still negated, and they are still destroyed during the End Phase.
    *   Destroying the Special Summoned monsters in the End Phase does not start a chain.

  
## DOOMSDAY HORROR

*   "Doomsday Horror"'s effects include your opponent's removed from play DARK monsters.
*   The values determined for "Doomsday Horror"'s first effect are not treated as its original ATK or DEF.

  
## DOPPELGANGER

*   “Doppelganger’s” effect starts a Chain after the effect that inflicted damage resolves.
*   If you take damage from two or more effects in the same Chain, “Doppelganger’s” effect will activate once for each of those effects after the Chain resolves. Then, “Doppelganger’s” effects will form a new Chain.
*   You cannot activate “Doppelganger” (flip it face-up) during the Damage Step.
*   “Doppelganger’s” effect will activate during the Damage Step if it was face-up on the field.
*   If “Cannon Soldier”, etc. is Tributed as a cost to activate its own effect to inflict damage, “Doppelganger’s” effect will still activate.
*   If you take damage from multiple monsters’ Continuous Effects at the same time, like “Rapid-Fire Magician”, “Doppelganger’s” effect only activates once, and inflicts damage equal to the damage from only 1 of those monster’s Continuous Effects.
*   You can activate (flip face-up) “Doppelganger”, and activate its effect as part of the same Chain Link, after a monster’s effect that inflicts damage to you resolves.

  
## DORA OF FATE

*   "Dora of Fate"'s effect only applies when you Summon a monster, not when your opponent Summons a monster.
*   "Dora of Fate" targets: the face-up monster on your opponent's side of the field.
*   If you Summon multiple times with "Ultimate Offering", "Dora of Fate" only applies to the first Summon.
*   You cannot use "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Dora of Fate".
*   You get the "Dora of Fate"'s effect even if the monster you selected (on your opponent's side of the field) is destroyed before you Summon.

  
## DOUBLE ATTACK

*   Discarding a monster for “Double Attack” is a cost. This effect targets.
*   If you use “Cost Down” so that your “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” in your hand is Level 6, then you cannot discard it to activate “Double Attack” and target your Level 7 “Dark Magician” on the field.
*   If you use “Double Attack” on a monster such as “Twinheaded Beast” it still only gets two attacks, not three.
*   You cannot discard a Level 1 monster for “Double Attack”.

  
## DOUBLE SNARE

*   You can destroy "Jinzo", "Royal Decree", "Tyrant Dragon", "Sorcerer of Dark Magic", "Fiend Skull Dragon", and "The Dragon’s Bead" with this card’s effect.
*   You cannot destroy "Ryu Senshi" because of its effect that prevents it from being targeted by a Spell Card.
*   You cannot destroy "Reaper of the Cards" or "Trap Master" because they do not negate Trap Cards, they destroy Trap Cards.
*   You can only destroy face-up cards with the effect of "Double Snare". The opponent may chain "Book of Moon" to your "Double Snare" to flip his / her monster face-down, and it will not be destroyed.

  
## DOUBLE SPELL

*   You select the card you are activating in your opponent's Graveyard when you activate "Double Spell". "Double Spell" can then be chained to after you announce your selection.
*   The selected card itself CANNOT be chained to as you are in resolution of the chain at that point.
*   If the selected Spell Card is Ritual, Normal, or Quick-Play (except for "Swords of Revealing Light"), it remains in your opponent's Graveyard and is not placed on the field, so you only need 1 vacant Spell & Trap Card Zone spot (for "Double Spell" itself) to activate "Double Spell".
*   If you activate "Double Spell" and select a Continuous, Field, or Equip Spell Card, or "Swords of Revealing Light", you place the selected Spell Card in your Spell & Trap Card Zone, so you need 2 vacant Spell & Trap Card Zone spots (1 for "Double Spell", 1 for the selected card). The Continuous/Field/Equip/"Swords of Revealing Light" Spell Card then remains on the field as normal.
*   The player who activates "Double Spell" pays any costs for the selected Spell Card (for "Delinquent Duo", "Tribute to the Doomed", etc.).
*   You cannot select a Spell Card with "Double Spell" that cannot be activated, such as an Equip Spell Card when no monsters are on the field.
*   You cannot use "Double Spell" while "Necrovalley" is in effect.

  
## DOUBLE SUMMON

*   You can activate this card before or after you use your Normal Summon for the turn. The extra Summon granted by this card’s effect can be used any time you could Normal Summon, and you are not considered to be Summoning a monster with this card’s effect.
*   You can activate multiple copies of this card in the same turn, but you can only gain 1 extra Summon per turn from this card. You can gain additional Normal Summons from other cards like "Ultimate Offering", etc.

  
## DOUBLE TOOL C&D  
> Equip only to a "Power Tool Dragon" or Level 4 or higher Machine-Type "Morphtronic" monster you control. While equipped: ● During your turn: It gains 1000 ATK. If it attacks, any effects of the attack target that activate or apply on the field are negated during that Battle Phase. ● During your opponent's turn: Your opponent cannot select a monster other than the equipped monster as an attack target. An opponent's monster that battles the equipped monster is destroyed at the end of the Damage Step.

*   “Double Tool C&D” can only be equipped to a monster you control. If control shifts to the opponent, “Double Tool C&D” will be destroyed.
*   A monster equipped with “Double Tool C&D” only negates a monster’s effect during your turn while the 2 monsters are battling. This means that it only negates effects that activate on the field, or are continuous effects while on the field.
*   Effects that activate in the Graveyard like “Sangan” are not negated. “Double Tool C&D’s” effect that destroys a monster during the opponent’s turn starts a Chain. If, during your opponent’s turn, the opponent’s monster attacks your monster equipped with “Double Tool C&D,” and is destroyed by battle, the effect of “Double Tool C&D” that would destroy that monster does not activate.
*   If you have two monsters, each equipped with “Double Tool C&D,” your opponent cannot attack.

  
## DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD TECHNIQUE

*   If one of the two selected “Six Samurai” monsters is removed from the Graveyard before “Double-Edged Sword Technique” is resolved, the remaining selected “Six Samurai” monster will still be Special Summoned. When it is destroyed in the End Phase you will only receive damage according to its ATK.
*   The effect that destroys the Special Summoned “Six Samurai” monsters and inflicts damage based on their ATK does not begin a Chain.
*   Only “Six Samurai” monsters destroyed by “Double-Edged Sword Technique’s” effect in the End Phase will be used to determine the damage inflicted. If one of the “Six Samurai” monsters Special Summoned by “Double-Edged Sword Technique” is equipped with “Legendary Ebon Steed”, the “Legendary Ebon Steed” is destroyed instead, and because the “Six Samurai” monster was not destroyed its ATK will not be used to calculate the damage.

  
## DRAGGED DOWN INTO THE GRAVE

*   You can't activate "Dragged Down into the Grave" if either you, or your opponent, has no cards in hand other than "Dragged Down into the Grave".
*   You can activate this card if a player has no cards left in the Deck.
*   The turn player selects a card first for "Dragged Down into the Grave".
*   "Appropriate" can be activated after "Dragged Down into the Grave" resolves, because drawing a card(s) was the last thing to happen.

  
## DRAGON CAPTURE JAR

*   Dragon-Type monsters on both sides of the field are affected by "Dragon Capture Jar".
*   If "Stop Defense" is activated targeting a Dragon-Type monster, it is switched to Attack Position, but then is immediately changed back to Defense Position since the effect of "Dragon Capture Jar" is continuous.

  
## DRAGON ICE  
> ① When your opponent Special Summons a monster, you can discard 1 card to Special Summon this card from your hand or Graveyard. ② There can only be 1 face-up "Dragon Ice" monster on the field.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect CANNOT be activated in the Damage Step \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=13836493&postcount=31)\].
    *   This is similar to "Green Baboon, Defender of the Forest"'s, whose rulings were updated \[[REF](https://img.yugioh-card.com/lat-am/gameplay/errata/YGOErrata100105.pdf)\].
    *   This effect does not target.
    *   Discarding 1 card is a cost. "Dragon Ice" itself can be discarded as cost, and then Special Summon from your Graveyard.
*   The ② Unclassified effect applies while "Dragon Ice" is face-up. This effect cannot be negated.
    *   You can Special Summon multiple copies of "Dragon Ice" by "Return from the Different Dimension". However, excess copies will be destroyed by game mechanic before you proceed to resolve the next link in the chain (or enter an open gamestate).

  
## DRAGONIC KNIGHT

*   "Dragonic Knight"'s Quick Effect is chained to the effect of your opponent's Monster Card that would destroy your card(s). The card(s) targeted by the effect of your opponent's Monster Card are sent to the Graveyard as a cost.
*   "Dragonic Knight"'s effect can only be activated if the effect of your opponent Monster Card targets card(s) you control. When your opponent activates the effect of "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" to destroy every Spell and Trap Card on the field, you cannot chain "Dragonic Knight"'s effect, because the effect of "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" does not target your Spell or Trap Cards on the field.
*   If the effect of your opponent's Monster Card targets a card you control and a card your opponent controls, you can chain "Dragonic Knight"'s effect by sending only your targeted card to the Graveyard.
*   "Dragonic Knight"'s effect must be immediately chained to the effect of your opponent's Monster Card that targets card(s) you control. You cannot activate the effect of another card and then chain "Dragonic Knight"'s effect.

  
## DRAGON'S GUNFIRE

*   You select which of the two effects you will use when you activate this card, before the opponent decides if they want to chain or not. If you choose the second effect, you select a target monster at activation also.

  
## DRAGON'S MIRROR  
> Remove from play, from your side of the field or your Graveyard, Fusion Material Monsters that are listed on a Dragon-Type Fusion Monster Card, and Special Summon that Fusion Monster from your Fusion Deck. (This Special Summon is treated as a Fusion Summon.)

*   “Dragon’s Mirror” does not target. You select and remove the monsters during resolution.
*   You can use fusion substitute monsters like “King of the Swamp” for “Dragon’s Mirror”.
*   If “Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer” is on your opponent’s side of the field, you can activate “Dragon’s Mirror” if all the Fusion Material Monsters are on the field; but not if any of them are in the Graveyard.

  
## DRAGON QUEEN OF TRAGIC ENDINGS  
> Ⓒ This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set. Ⓢ This card can only be Special Summoned by controlling 3 or more face-up Continuous Spell Cards. ① When this attacking card inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent, your opponent selects and sends 1 card from their hand to the Graveyard, and you draw 1 card. ② During your Standby Phase, if this card is in your Graveyard and was sent there from the field, you can send 1 face-up Continuous Spell Card you control to the Graveyard to Special Summon this card from the Graveyard.

*   The Ⓢ Special Summon procedure is the only way to properly Summoned this card.
    *   This card can only be Special Summoned by Ⓢ from your hand.
    *   This card can be Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted” after being properly Summoned.
*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation.
    *   If your opponent has no cards in their hand to send to the Graveyard, you cannot draw a card.
    *   If your opponent sends a card to the Graveyard but you have no cards to draw, you lose the Duel.
    *   This effect resolves sequentially: your opponent sends a card to the Graveyard, then you draw one.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect activates in the Graveyard.
    *   Sending a Continuous Spell Card to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   This effect does not target "Dragon Queen of Tragic Endings". It is not negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   You don’t have to Special Summon this card the turn after it is sent from the field to the Graveyard. You can wait several turns and then Special Summon it during a later Standby Phase.
    *   This effect cannot activate if this card was removed from the Graveyard after being sent there.

  
## DRAGON'S RAGE

*   If you attack with "Spear Dragon" or a Dragon-Type monster equipped with "Fairy Meteor Crush", the difference between your monster’s ATK and the attacked monster’s DEF will only be inflicted as Battle Damage once. The effect of "Dragon’s Rage" will not inflict the damage again.

  
## DRAINING SHIELD

*   You activate "Draining Shield" when the monster controlled by your opponent declares an attack.
*   You gain Life Points for "Draining Shield" equal to the attacking monster's current ATK.

  
## DRAMATIC RESCUE

*   You can activate "Dramatic Rescue" when an Amazoness on your side of the field is targeted, such as with any Equip Spell Card, "Tribute to the Doomed", "Trap Hole", "Man-Eater Bug", "Relinquished", "Dark Cat with White Tail", "Amazoness Spellcaster", "Penguin Soldier" (even if it targets 2 monsters), "Change of Heart", "Ring of Destruction", "XYZ Dragon Cannon", etc. But not when cards like "Raigeki", "Dark Hole", "Mirror Force", "Fissure", "Creature Swap", "Guardian Sphinx", "Bottomless Trap Hole", "Adhesive Trap Hole", etc. are used.
*   You cannot activate "Dramatic Rescue" when your face-down Amazoness is targeted (with "Nobleman of Crossout", etc.).
*   You can activate "Dramatic Rescue" when your opponent's Amazoness controlled by you is targeted; in this case, the Amazoness returns to your opponent's hand but it is you (the player who activated "Dramatic Rescue") that gets to Special Summon a monster.
*   If you activate "Dramatic Rescue" and your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" and destroys the Amazoness, the Amazoness does not return to your hand and "Dramatic Rescue"'s effect disappears (so no monster is Special Summoned).
*   If you have no monster to Special Summon, you cannot activate "Dramatic Rescue".
*   You cannot Special Summon the Monster Card that you returned to your hand with "Dramatic Rescue", but if you have a second copy of that monster in your hand you may Special Summon the second copy.
*   You can Special Summon high-level monsters with "Dramatic Rescue" but not "Special Summon-only" monsters.
*   If you activate "Amazoness Spellcaster", and chain "Dramatic Rescue", "Amazoness Spellcaster"'s effect disappears.
*   If your opponent activates "Snatch Steal" to take control of your Amazoness, and you chain "Dramatic Rescue", "Snatch Steal"'s effect disappears.

  
## DRASTIC DROP OFF

*   If your opponent discards card(s) after drawing or adding card(s) to their hand as part of the same effect resolution, you cannot activate "Drastic Drop Off". For example, when your opponent resolves "Graceful Charity", you cannot activate "Drastic Drop Off".
*   If you're the one using this card, tell your opponent that you might want to activate an effect before they shuffle the drawn card into their hand. Also ask them if they wish to activate anything before you do.
*   If your opponent draws "Mystical Space Typhoon" for their Normal Draw, they retain priority to activate it during the Draw Phase. If they do so, you can no longer activate "Drastic Drop Off" as the card they drew is no longer in their hand \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=1052536)\].
*   If Destiny Hero - Dasher is in your opponent's Graveyard, and you have a Set "Drastic Drop Off": when your opponent draws a Monster Card during their Draw Phase, they can activate Dasher's effect (as Chain Link 1). However, you can chain "Drastic Drop Off" to discard the Monster Card they drew.

  
## DREADSCYTHE HARVESTER

*   “Dreadscythe Harvester’s” effect is an Ignition Effect. Tributing 1 Insect-Type monster is a cost to activate this effect.

  
## DREAMSPRITE

*   The effect of "Dreamsprite" is not optional so if you have at least 1 other monster on the field when "Dreamsprite" is attacked, the attack target is changed to your other monster. This is also true if "Dreamsprite" is attacked when face-down.
*   If your "Dreamsprite" equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" is chosen as an attack target, and you control another monster, the effect of "Dreamsprite" will still change the attack target to your other monster.
*   If you control "Dreamsprite", "The Legendary Fisherman", and "Umi" is on the field, "Dreamsprite"’s effect can still change an attack target to "The Legendary Fisherman" because he is not being targeted with an attack, but is being targeted with a monster effect.
*   If you control two "Dreamsprites" and one is attacked, you cannot continue to switch the attack target between the two "Dreamsprites" because the effect of "Dreamsprite" says that you must calculate damage on the new target.

  
## DRILLAGO

*   If there are Spell or Trap Cards, or face-down monsters, on your opponent's side of the field, "Drillago" cannot attack directly.
*   If "Drillago" attacks directly, and your opponent activates an effect to reduce one of his face-up monsters to less than 1600 ATK, there is no longer a condition allowing "Drillago" to attack directly, and a replay occurs.
*   If "Drillago" attacks directly, and your opponent activates "Ready for Intercepting" from his hand, because his/her "Makyura the Destructor" was sent to the Graveyard earlier this turn, to flip one of his face-up monsters face-down, there is no longer a condition allowing "Drillago" to attack directly, and a replay occurs.

  
## DRILLROID

*   “Drillroid” can use its effect to destroy face-up and face-down Defense Position monsters that it attacks.
*   Note that “Drillroid” does not say “without flipping the monster face-up”. The effect of “Drillroid” is applied after the monster is flipped face-up, but before damage calculation. If the Defense Position monster was face-down and has a Flip Effect, the Flip Effect will activate and resolve normally.
*   The effect of “Drillroid” is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to.
*   If “Drillroid” attacks a face-up “Sasuke Samurai #4”, do the coin toss for “Sasuke Samurai #4” first, at the beginning of the Damage Step. If “Sasuke Samurai #4” destroys “Drillroid” with its effect, the effect of “Drillroid” is not applied. (If “Sasuke Samurai #4” was face-down, then you miss the chance to use its effect.)
*   If “Drillroid” attacks “Dreamsprite”, both are mandatory Trigger Effects with the same timing, so they form a chain with “Dreamsprite” as Chain Link 2. “Dreamsprite” resolves first and, according to her effect, causes damage calculation to happen immediately. Since the effect of “Drillroid” only happens without damage calculation, the effect of “Drillroid” disappears.
*   If “Drillroid” attacks a Defense Position “D.D. Warrior Lady”, the effect of “D.D. Warrior Lady” does not activate, because she has been destroyed by the effect of “Drillroid” by the time her effect would normally activate.
*   If “Drillroid” attacks a face-down Defense Position monster while “Final Attack Orders” is active, the monster is not destroyed because it flips face-up and immediately shifts to Attack Position.
*   “Nightmare Penguin” will activate its effect if attacked by “Drillroid” while face-down. (Just like a Flip Effect.)

  
## DRILL SYNCHRON  
> While you control this face-up card, during each battle between a Warrior Defense Position monster whose DEF is lower than the ATK of the attacking monster, inflict the difference as Battle Damage to your opponent. Once per turn, when you inflict battle damage to your opponent with this effect, you can draw 1 card.

*   The effect to draw a card is a Trigger Effect that activates after damage calculation.
*   The effect to draw a card will stack with effects like “Spiral SpIf you control 2 “Drill Synchrons” you can activate the effect of both of them when your WarriorDefense Position monster and inflicts damage.

  
## DRILL WARRIOR  
> ① Once per turn, during your Main Phase, you can halve this card’s ATK (permanently). If you do, it can attack your opponent directly this turn. ② Once per turn, during your Main Phase, you can discard 1 card and remove this card from play. ③ During your next Standby Phase, Special Summon this card, if removed by this effect. Then, add 1 Monster Card from your Graveyard to your hand.

*   The ① Ignition Effect does not target this card.
    *   This card's ATK is halved when the effect resolves. This is not a cost.
*   The ② Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Discard 1 card (of your choice) when this effect resolves. This is not a cost.  
    *   Discarding 1 card and banishing this card occur simultaneously
        *   Monsters with optional Trigger Effects (ex: "Peten the Dark Clown") do not miss the timing.  
            
    *   This card is still banished if flipped face-down (by "Book of Moon"), you still discard 1 card \[[REF](http://web.archive.org/web/20130529020634/http://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=843371)\].  
    *   If cards cannot be banished when this effect resolves, you still discard 1 card.  
    *   If this card leaves the field before this effect resolves, you still discard 1 card \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=858617)\].
    *   If you cannot discard a card when resolves this effect, this card is not removed from play \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=858617)\].  
        
*   The ③ mandatory Trigger Effect resolves sequentially.
    *   FIRST: Special Summon "Drill Warrior", THEN: add a Monster from your Graveyard to your hand.
    *   This effect only activates if "Drill Warrior" was removed from play by its ② Ignition Effect.
    *   This effect does not target a monster in the Graveyard. It is not negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   This effect activates / resolves removed from play. It is not negated by "Skill Drain" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=843553)\].
    *   This effect will start a chain at any point during the Standby Phase.
    *   If 2+ copies of "Drill Warrior" are removed from play, activate & resolve each in separate Chains.
    *   This effect activates even if no monsters are in your Graveyard. "Drill Warrior" is still Summoned.
    *   If this effect resolves while your Monster Card Zones are all occupied, the banished "Drill Warrior" is sent to the Graveyard, and you do not add a monster from the Graveyard to your hand \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=900049)\].
    *   If this effect is negated (by "Royal Oppression"), "Drill Warrior" remains removed from play and cannot activate this effect again \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=832275), [REF2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=656779)\].
    *   VS. "Torrential Tribute": If "Drill Warrior" adds a monster from the Graveyard to the hand, then "Torrential Tribute" cannot activate. "Torrential Tribute" can activate if a monster cannot be added.

  
## DROP OFF

*   The card discarded by the effect of "Drop Off" is considered to be discarded from your hand, not your Deck. If "Penguin Knight" is the card discarded, its effect will not activate. If "Electric Snake", "Regenerating Mummy", or "Fear from the Dark" is the card discarded, its effect will activate.
*   This card is activated during the opponent’s Draw Phase in response to the opponent drawing a card. It is not chained to the draw.
*   If a Quick-Play Spell Card is drawn, the opponent may activate it in a chain to "Drop Off" and the effect of "Drop Off" will disappear since the drawn card is no longer in the opponent’s hand.
*   If the fifth and final piece of Exodia is drawn, the opponent wins before the effect of "Drop Off" is resolved.

  
## DUCKER MOBILE CANNON

*   "DUCKER Mobile Cannon"'s effect targets 1 Level 4 monster in your Graveyard.

  
## DUMMY GOLEM

*   If “Dummy Golem” is attacked, flipped, and destroyed by damage calculation, its effect is not applied because it is destroyed. So control does not switch.
*   If an effect like “Ring of Destruction” is chained to the Flip Effect of “Dummy Golem”, destroying “Dummy Golem”, the effect of “Dummy Golem” disappears.
*   If the opponent only has one monster, and it is “Blindly Loyal Goblin” or “Mataza the Zapper”, and you activate the Flip Effect of “Dummy Golem”, the effect does activate and can be chained to, however its effect disappears because control of “Blindly Loyal Goblin” cannot switch.
*   If the opponent has “Blindly Loyal Goblin” and “Gemini Elf” on the field, and you activate the Flip Effect of “Dummy Golem”, the opponent cannot select “Blindly Loyal Goblin”. They must select “Gemini Elf”.
*   If control of monsters switches with “Dummy Golem”, it stays switched as long as the cards remain on the field. (Like “Creature Swap”.)
*   The effect of “Dummy Golem” will NOT resolve if any of the following is true: ① “Dummy Golem” is not on the field when the effect resolves; ② “Dummy Golem” has been destroyed before the effect resolves, such as by damage calculation; ③ there is no opponent’s monster when the effect resolves, such as if it was returned to the hand with “Compulsory Evacuation Device”.

  
## DUPE FROG  
> ① This card's name is treated as "Des Frog" while it is face-up on the field. ② Your opponent cannot select another monster as an attack target. ③ When this card is sent from the field to the Graveyard, you can add 1 "Frog" monster except "Dupe Frog" or "Frog the Jam" from your Deck or Graveyard to your hand.

*   The ① Continuous Effect causes "Dupe Frog" to be counted towards the effect of "Des Croaking".
*   The ② Continuous Effect applies while face-up on the field. It can be negated by "Skill Drain".
    *   If 2+ copies of "Dupe Frog" are face-up on your field, your opponent cannot attack your monsters, but they can still attack directly (with "Drill Warrior").
*   The ③ optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect does not target a card in the Graveyard. It is not negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   This "_When... you can_..." effect can miss the timing.
    *   This effect will NOT activate if "Dupe Frog" was Tributed for a cost or a Tribute Summon.
    *   This effect will NOT activate if "Dupe Frog" was used as Fusion or Synchro Material.
    *   This effect will NOT activate if "Dupe Frog" was sent to the Graveyard as Chain Link 2(+).
    *   This effect WILL activate if "Dupe Frog" is destroyed by Battle and sent to the Graveyard.
    *   This effect WILL activate if "Dupe Frog" is sent to the Graveyard as the last part of Chain Link 1.

  
## DUST BARRIER

*   If you skip your second Standby Phase with "Solomon's Lawbook", etc., then "Dust Barrier" remains on the field and its effect continues to apply.
*   If "Imperial Order" is active during the 2nd Standby Phase after activation, "Dust Barrier" is still destroyed.

  
## DUST TORNADO

*   You must destroy 1 Spell or Trap Card on your opponent’s side of the field to be able to Set 1 Spell or Trap Card. If your opponent chains a card to destroy the target of "Dust Tornado", you cannot then Set a Spell or Trap Card because "Dust Tornado" did not destroy a Spell or Trap Card.
*   If your opponent activates the card targeted by "Dust Tornado" it is not negated, but is still destroyed by "Dust Tornado" so you may Set 1 Spell or Trap Card.

  
## EAGLE EYE

*   The effect of this monster prevents the activation of Trap Cards that can be activated when a monster is Normal Summoned, such as "Trap Hole" and "Torrential Tribute".
*   You can activate Trap Cards later in the turn.
*   You can negate the Normal Summon of this monsters with "Horn of Heaven" or "Solemn Judgment". (In which case the Normal Summon failed and the effect of the monster is not applied.)
*   The effect of this monster is applied to both players (so you cannot activate "Pineapple Blast" in response to your Normal Summon of this monster).
*   This is a Continuous Effect that you cannot chain to.

  
## EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL ASLLA PISCU

*   If you control an Earthbound Immortal and no other monsters, your opponent cannot attack you, because they cannot select the Earthbound Immortal as an attack target. (Exception: they can attack with monsters that can attack directly, such as “Submarineroid.”)
*   If the only Earthbound Immortal on the field is an Equip Spell Card, it is not treated as a monster so you can Summon an Earthbound Immortal.
*   If you replace your opponent’s Field Spell Card by activating one of your own, there is a face-up Field Spell Card continuously on the field, so any Earthbound Immortal on the field would not be destroyed.
    *   If you activate a new Field Spell Card, replacing your own Field Spell Card, there is a gap when no Field Spell Card is on the field, so any Earthbound Immortal would be destroyed.
*   If you Special Summon an Earthbound Immortal by chaining “Call of the Haunted” or “Revival of the Immortals” to the activation of a Field Spell Card, even though the Field Spell Card has not resolved when the Earthbound Immortal is Special Summoned as Chain Link 2, the Earthbound Immortal will remain on the field, undestroyed.
*   ‘Destroyed by its own effect’ refers to being destroyed if there is no Field Spell Card on the field.
*   If a face-down “Earthbound Immortal Aslla piscu” is flipped face-up while another Earthbound Immortal is on the field, the flipped Aslla piscu is destroyed. However, this is not considered as ‘destroyed by its own effect’ so its effect will activate to destroy monsters and inflict damage.
*   If a face-down “Earthbound Immortal Aslla piscu” is attacked while there is no Field Spell Card on the field, and the attacking monster destroys it by battle: Aslla piscu is destroyed by battle, it is not destroyed by its effect after that, and when Aslla piscu is sent to the Graveyard as a result of that battle, its effect will activate to destroy monsters and inflict damage.
*   If “Earthbound Immortal Aslla piscu” is removed from the field face-down, its effect to destroy monsters and inflict damage does not activate.
*   If “Earthbound Immortal Aslla piscu” is returned to the Deck from the field, its effect to destroy monsters and inflict damage does not activate.

  
## EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL CCAPAC APU

*   If you control an Earthbound Immortal and no other monsters, your opponent cannot attack you, because they cannot select the Earthbound Immortal as an attack target. (Exception: they can attack with monsters that can attack directly, such as “Submarineroid.”)
*   If the only Earthbound Immortal on the field is an Equip Spell Card, it is not treated as a monster so you can Summon an Earthbound Immortal.
*   If you replace your opponent’s Field Spell Card by activating one of your own, there is a face-up Field Spell Card continuously on the field, so any Earthbound Immortal on the field would not be destroyed.
    *   If you activate a new Field Spell Card, replacing your own Field Spell Card, there is a gap when no Field Spell Card is on the field, so any Earthbound Immortal would be destroyed.
*   If you Special Summon an Earthbound Immortal by chaining “Call of the Haunted” or “Revival of the Immortals” to the activation of a Field Spell Card, even though the Field Spell Card has not resolved when the Earthbound Immortal is Special Summoned as Chain Link 2, the Earthbound Immortal will remain on the field, undestroyed.
*   The effect of “Earthbound Immortal Ccapac Apu” that inflicts damage to the opponent activates at the end of the Damage Step, after the destroyed monster has been sent to the Graveyard. So the damage is based off the ATK in the Graveyard (the monster’s original ATK).

  
## EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL CCARAYHUA

*   The effect to destroy all cards on the field will activate even during the Damage Step.
*   If this face-down card is attacked while another “Earthbound Immortal” is face-up on the field it will be destroyed, but since it was not destroyed by a card effect it will not destroy all cards on the field.
*   If “Earthbound Immortal Ccarayhua” is destroyed while in your hand or Deck, its effect will activate.

  
## EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL CHACU CHALLHUA

*   The damage dealt is half of this card’s current DEFIf this card is changed to Defense Position during your opponent’s Battle Phase, the Battle Phase will continue.
*   If this card is not face-up on the field when its effect to inflict damage resolves, it will not be applied.

  
## EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL CUSILLU

*   Tributing 1 other monster you control is an effect, not a cost.
    *   If you Tribute “Lich Lord, King of the Underworld” for this effect, it will return to your hand.
    *   This effect is activated at the point in the Damage Step where monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the Graveyard.

  
## EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL URU

*   Tributing 1 monster is a cost to activate this effect.
*   This effect targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.
    *   If the target of this effect is flipped face-down by an effect Chained to this one, you do not gain control of the target monster.

  
## EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL WIRAQOCHA RASCA

*   This effect targets 1-3 cards you control.
    *   If you control your opponent’s card, you can target it with this effect. The card will return to your opponent’s Deck and will count towards the number of cards your opponent must discard at random and the ATK gain for this card.
*   If you target a Fusion or Synchro Monster with this effect, it returns to the appropriate Extra Deck and still counts towards the number of cards your opponent must discard and the ATK gain for this card.
*   If you use “Shrink” on “Earthbound Immortal Wiraqocha Rasca” its original ATK becomes 50, but it retains any ATK gained from its own effect.
*   If you choose to return a Field Spell you control to your Deck with the effect of “Earthbound Immortal Wiraqocha Rasca” you will return the card to your Deck, your opponent will discard as appropriate, this card will gain the appropriate amount of ATK, and then it will destroy itself by its own effect.
*   If “Skill Drain” is activated, this card loses any ATK gained from its effect and will not regain it even if “Skill Drain” later leaves the field.
*   If this card is turned face-down by a card that is chained to its effect, cards will still be returned to the Deck and your opponent will still discard, but this card will not gain any ATK.
*   If your opponent has fewer cards in hand than the number of cards you return to the Deck when this effect resolves, all of their remaining cards are discarded and this card will gain ATK only for each card discarded.
*   If your opponent has no cards in hand when you Normal Summon this card, you cannot activate its effect.

  
## EARTHBOUND SPIRIT'S INVITATION

*   "Earthbound Spirit's Invitation" does not target. You decide which monster your opponent's attacking monster will attack when resolving "Earthbound Spirit's Invitation".
*   If "Earthbound Spirit's Invitation" is chained to "Astral Barrier", "Astral Barrier" is applied. If "Astral Barrier" is chained to "Earthbound Spirit's Invitation", "Earthbound Spirit's Invitation" is applied.
*   When multiple "Earthbound Spirit's Invitation" are chained, only the last to resolve is applied.
*   You can select the same monster your opponent had already declared as the attack target.
*   The new attack target that you select must be a legal target for the attack. For example, you cannot change the attack target to one of your opponent's monsters.

  
## EARTHBOUND WAVE

*   If you do not control a face-up “Earthbound Immortal” monster when this card resolves, you still negate the activation of your opponent’s Spell or Trap Card.

  
## EARTHBOUND WHIRLWIND

*   Even if there is no “Earthbound Immortal” on your side of the field when “Earthbound Whirlwind” resolves, its effect will still be applied.

  
## EBON ARROW

*   If the monster targeted by “Ebon Arrow” destroys a monster with equal ATK (so both are destroyed), the opponent still takes damage based on their destroyed monster’s DEF. “Ebon Arrow” targets the monster you select. If a monster is targeted by 2 “Ebon Arrow” effects, it loses 1000 ATK, and both effects that inflict damage based on DEF will activate (they form a chain). However, the battle damage inflicted to the opponent still only happens once. You can activate “Ebon Arrow” during the Damage Step, or during Main Phase 2. If control of the monster switches to the opponent and it battles, it is your opponent who will take damage from the effect of “Ebon Arrow”. You can target “Elemental Hero Wildheart” but the effects will not be applied.

  
## EBON MAGICIAN CURRAN

*   The effect of “Ebon Magician Curran” is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to.
*   Count the number of monsters on the opponent’s side of the field when you resolve the effect of “Ebon Magician Curran”, not when it activates.
*   If “Ebon Magician Curran” is Special Summoned during the Standby Phase while “King Tiger Wanghu” is on the field, both Trigger Effects activate immediately and form a chain.

  
## ECCENTRIC BOY  
Ⓒ When using this card as a Synchro Material Monster, the other Synchro Material Monster is 1 monster in your hand. ① The Synchro Monster that used this card as a Synchro Material Monster cannot activate its effect, its effect(s) is negated, and it is removed from play when removed from the field.

*   The Ⓒ Condition is not an effect and does not activate. It is not negated by "Skill Drain".
    *   This performs a Synchro Summon. The monster Summoned can be Special Summoned from the Graveyard / removed from play area afterwards.
    *   Correct Synchro Material Monsters must be used.
    *   This cannot be used to Summon Synchro Monsters requiring 2+ non-Tuners (like "Mist Wurm").
    *   The altered Level (by "Cost Down") of the monster in hand is applied for the Synchro Summon.
    *   If "[Beast of the Pharaoh](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Beast_of_the_Pharaoh)" was used and the Summon was not negated, its effect can activate.
    *   If "[Tuningware](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tuningware)" is used, it cannot be treated as a Level 2, but you can activate its effect to draw a card when the Synchro Monster is successfully Synchro Summoned.
*   The ① Unclassified Effect applies as long as the Synchro Monster remains face-up on the field.
    *   Example: If "Colossal Fighter" is destroyed by battle, and "Imperial Iron Wall" prevents it from being removed from play, its effect will activate in the Graveyard and will not be negated.
    *   If the Synchro Monster is flipped face-down, this effect no longer applies.
    *   If the Synchro Monster is removed from play by "[Interdimensional Matter Transporter](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Interdimensional_Matter_Transporter)", it is treated as being removed from play by the effect of "Eccentric Boy" and remains removed from play.
*   VS. "[De-Synchro](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/De-Synchro)": if the Synchro Monster is not returned to the Extra Deck (because it was removed from play by the effect of "Eccentric Boy"), you cannot Special Summon the Synchro Material Monsters.
*   VS. "[Urgent Tuning](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Urgent_Tuning)": you may perform the Synchro Summon using "[Eccentric Boy](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Eccentric_Boy)" and a monster in your hand. If you do not have a monster in your hand which can be used as a Synchro Material Monster or you do not have a Synchro Monster in your Extra Deck which can be Special Summoned, then the opponent can check your hand and your Extra Deck to verify. You cannot activate "[Urgent Tuning](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Urgent_Tuning)" if you do not have a monster in your hand which can be used for a Synchro Summon.

  
## ECTOPLASMER

*   "Ectoplasmer" causes the turn player to Tribute during his/her End Phase, but the opponent does not Tribute. So while "Ectoplasmer" is out, I Tribute in my End Phase, and you Tribute in your End Phase. But I don't Tribute in yours and you don't Tribute in mine.
*   So 1 Tribute is performed during the End Phase of each player's turn. The Tribute is performed by the turn player. (Both players have to do this during their respective End Phases, not just the controller of "Ectoplasmer".)
*   Tributing a monster for "Ectoplasmer" is not a cost, it’s an effect, so you can't Tribute monsters unaffected by Spell Cards.
*   If you have a face-up monster on your side of the field during the End Phase, you have to Tribute for "Ectoplasmer"’s effect.
*   You can chain "Mystical Space Typhoon" or "Raigeki Break" to "Ectoplasmer"'s effect, and if there is no "Ectoplasmer" on the field, then its effect is not applied.
*   You can activate "Soul Exchange" during your Main Phase and use its effect to Tribute your opponent’s monster for "Ectoplasmer" during the End Phase.
*   If you Tribute your opponent’s monster that you controlled with "Snatch Steal" or "Change of Heart", your opponent takes the damage even though it was their monster.

  
## EDGE HAMMER

*   This card targets 1 opponent's monster.
*   If you destroy a monster whose original ATK is undefined, like "King of the Skull Servants", this card will not inflict any damage to the opponent.
*   If an effect like "Enemy Controller" is chained to "Edge Hammer" and control of the targeted monster switches, it will not be destroyed by "Edge Hammer".

  
## EHREN, LIGHTSWORN MONK  
> ① If this card attacks a Defense Position monster, return that monster to its owner’s Deck before damage calculation. ② During each of your End Phases, send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates in Substep 3 - Before Damage Calculation.
    *   This effect activates after Set monsters are Flipped face-up (in Substep 2).
    *   A Set Flip Monster's Flip Effect will activate and resolve normally in Substep 6 - Resolve Effects.
        *   A Set "Nightmare Penguin"'s effect will still activate if attacked by Ehren \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=554985), [REF2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=980131)\].
    *   When this effect is applied, Substep 4 - Damage Calculation does not occur.
    *   This effect will not activate if Ehren leaves the field earlier in the Damage Step.
        *   Ex: "Sasuke Samurai #4"'s effect destroys Ehren in Substep 1 - Start of the Damage Step.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect must resolve (even if the effect is negated) before the turn can end.
    *   If you do not have enough cards to send to the Graveyard remaining in your Deck when resolving this effect, all cards remaining in your Deck are sent to the Graveyard.
    *   If the activation of this effect is negated by "Light and Darkness Dragon", it will activate again in the same End Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
    *   If this effect is negated by "Skill Drain", it will not activate again in the same End Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
    *   The "Lightsworn" monster (or "Judgment Dragon") must remain face-up on the field in order to activate and resolve this effect.
    *   If your opponent activates "Book of Eclipse" after you resolve this effect, when "Book of Eclipse" resolves and your affected monsters are flipped face-up (and you draw 1 card for each) then each "Lightsworn" monster (or "Judgment Dragon") will once again activate this effect \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=678963)\]
*   ② VS. "Brain Control": Player A gains control of Player B's "Lightsworn" monster until the End Phase. During the End Phase, Player A may decide in which order to activate/resolve effects:
    1.  Player A resolves "Brain Control" first, restoring control of the "Lightsworn" monster to Player B. That "Lightsworn" monster is no longer controlled by the turn player, thus its effect will not activate.
    2.  Player A activates and resolves the "Lightsworn" monster's effect to send cards from the top of their Deck to the Graveyard. Then that "Lightsworn" monster is returned to Player B's control \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=653322)\].
*   ② VS. "Enemy Controller":
    *   During Player A's turn, Player B gains control of Player A's "Lightsworn" monster. During the End Phase, when control of the "Lightsworn" monster is restored to Player A, its mandatory Trigger Effect will activate \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/85182-judgment-dragon-and-enemy-controller/)\].

  
## EKIBYO DRAKMORD

*   If "Imperial Order" was active during the end of the second turn, a monster equipped with "Ekibyo Drakmord" will not be destroyed and "Ekibyo Drakmord" will remain equipped to it.
*   If control of a monster equipped with "Ekibyo Drakmord" changes, the turn count resets. If "Ekibyo Drakmord" is moved by "Collected Power" or "Tailor of the Fickle" to another monster, the turn count resets.
*   If "Ekibyo Drakmord" is no longer on the field, a previously equipped monster will not be destroyed on the 2nd turn after "Ekibyo Drakmord" was played.
*   If "Ekibyo Drakmord" is equipped to "The Legendary Fisherman" and then "Umi" is activated, "Ekibyo Drakmord" will remain meaninglessly equipped to "The Legendary Fisherman".

  
## ELECTRIC LIZARD

*   If the non-Zombie-Type monster is removed from the field or flipped face-down, it can attack in the following turn.

  
## ELECTRIC SNAKE

*   If the summoning of "Electric Snake" is negated by "Solemn Judgment", etc. its effect is not activated, as it is not considered to have gone directly from your hand to the Graveyard.

  
## ELECTRIC VIRUS  
> ① By discarding this card from your hand to the Graveyard, take control of 1 face-up Machine or Dragon-Type monster your opponent controls until the end of this turn.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates and resolves from your hand.
    *   Discarding this card is a cost.
    *   This effect targets.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down, control of the target will not switch.
    *   If the target is not a Machine or Dragon-Type (by “DNA Surgery”), the target does not switch control.
*   If “DNA Surgery” is activated later after this effect has resolved, it has no effect.
    *   (Control does not instantly change back. Control changes back as normal at the end of the turn.)

  
## ELEMENT DRAGON

*   If a FIRE and a WIND monster are on the field, you get both effects.
*   If there are 2 FIRE monsters on the field, Element Dragon’s ATK is 2000 (it only gets the +500 ATK bonus once, no matter how many FIRE monsters are on the field).
*   If there is only 1 WIND monster on the field, and you attack and destroy it with "Element Dragon", you cannot attack again because there is no longer a WIND monster on the field so "Element Dragon" no longer has that ability.
*   Monsters that have their Attribute changed with "DNA Transplant" or "Scroll of Bewitchment" are included for "Element Dragon"’s effect.
*   If there are no face-up FIRE monsters on the field, and "Element Dragon" attacks a face-down FIRE monster, "Element Dragon"’s effect that increases its ATK by 500 points is applied before damage calculation because it is a Continuous Effect.

  
## ELEMENT SOLDIER

*   If both a WATER and an EARTH monster are on the field, you get both effects.
*   If the only EARTH monster on the field is your opponent’s "Giant Rat", and your "Element Soldier" attacks and destroys it, there is no EARTH monster on the field when "Giant Rat"’s effect activates in the Graveyard, so "Element Soldier" no longer has the ability to negate monster effects and "Giant Rat"’s effect resolves as normal. (Monsters destroyed by "Element Soldier" that have effects that activate in the Graveyard will only have their effects negated if an EARTH monster is on the field at the time the monster is sent to the Graveyard.)
*   If there are no face-up EARTH monsters on the field, and "Element Soldier" attacks a face-down "Man-Eater Bug", it is flipped up, and there is now an EARTH monster on the field when "Man-Eater Bug"’s effect would activate and resolve. So "Element Soldier" negates "Man-Eater Bug"’s effect.
*   Monsters that have their Attribute changed with "DNA Transplant" or "Scroll of Bewitchment" are included for "Element Soldier"’s effect.
*   If "Element Soldier" destroys "Sinister Serpent" while there is an EARTH monster on the field, "Sinister Serpent" cannot be added to your hand even if "Element Soldier" is removed from the field or loses its ability later on because there is no longer an EARTH monster.

  
## ELEMENTAL ABSORBER

*   Removing from play 1 Monster Card in your hand is not a cost. It is part of the effect of “Elemental Absorber”.
*   You only remove from play 1 Monster Card from your hand and when “Elemental Absorber” resolves. You can’t remove additional cards later. You can’t remove from play more than 1 card when “Elemental Absorber” resolves.
*   The effect will continue even if the removed Monster Card doesn’t stay removed from play. For example, if the removed monster is “D.D. Scout Plane” it will be Special Summoned during the End Phase, and your opponent’s DARK monsters will still not be able to attack.

  
## ELEMENTAL BURST

*   You can use a monster whose Attribute has been changed with “Scroll of Bewitchment” to activate “Elemental Burst”.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO ABSOLUTE ZERO  
1 "Elemental Hero", "Destiny Hero", or "Evil Hero" monster + 1 WATER monster  
_Ⓒ This monster cannot be Special Summoned except by Fusion Summon. ① This card gains 500 ATK for each face-up WATER monster on the field, except "Elemental Hero Absolute Zero". ② When this card is removed from the field, destroy all monsters your opponent controls._

*   Fusion Material cannot include "Hero Kid", as it is neither a HERO monster nor a WATER monster.
*   The Ⓒ Condition restricts how this card can be Special Summoned.
    *   This card CANNOT be Special Summoned from the Graveyard / removed from play.
    *   This card CANNOT be Special Summoned from the Extra Deck by "[Summoner of Illusions](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Summoner_of_Illusions)".
*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   This effect does not apply if your other WATER monster is named "Elemental Hero Absolute Zero".
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect is activated by the owner of "Elemental HeroAbsolute Zero".
    *   ACTIVATES IF: this face-up card leaves the field (even under your opponent's control), even if it was returned to the Extra Deck.
    *   DOES NOT ACTIVATE IF: this face-down card leaves the field \[[1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=16793215&postcount=8), [2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=17349868&postcount=8), [3](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=19072708&postcount=12)\].
*   VS. "Starlight Road":
    *   If Absolute Zero's effect activated in the Graveyard / banished, "Starlight Road" can negate its effect but cannot destroy it. Thus, "Stardust Dragon" cannot be Special Summoned.
    *   If Absolute Zero's effect activated in the Extra Deck, "Starlight Road" can negate its effect and destroy it (sending it to the Graveyard), and "Stardust Dragon" can be Special Summoned.
*   VS. "De-Fusion":
    *   If "Elemental Hero Prisma" used its effect to change its name to "Elemental Hero Neos" and was used alongside a WATER monster to Fusion Summon Absolute Zero, you can still Special Summon that same "Elemental Hero Prisma" when "De-Fusion" resolves and returns Elemental HeroAbsolute Zero to the Extra Deck, even though it was being treated as "Elemental Hero Neos" at the time of the Fusion Summon.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO AIR NEOS

*   This card’s effect that adjusts its ATK is a Continuous Effect. It is recalculated any time there is a change in Life Points.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO AQUA NEOS

*   If this card was Special Summoned properly by its own effect, then you can Special Summon it from the Graveyard with “Call of the Haunted”, etc.
*   If you control your opponent’s “Elemental Hero Neos” or “Neo-Spacian”, you can return it to your opponent’s Deck to Special Summon this card.
*   This card’s effect activates during every End Phase. If this card is not face-up on the field during the End Phase of the turn it was Special Summoned, its effect will still activate during the next End Phase that it is face-up on the field for, and be returned to the Extra Deck.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO BUBBLEMAN

*   Missing the Timing: If “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” is Summoned by an effect in the middle of a chain, you will miss the timing and cannot draw the 2 cards.
*   You can only use the effect of “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” to Special Summon itself during your Main Phase.
*   If you choose not to draw 2 cards for “Elemental Hero Bubbleman’s” effect, it does not start a chain.
*   If “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” is destroyed and then Special Summoned by “Rope of Life” in the Damage Step, if there are no other cards on your side of the field, you can draw 2 cards for the effect of “Elemental Hero Bubbleman”.
*   If you Special Summon “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” by the effect of your opponent’s “Last Turn”, you can draw the 2 cards.
*   If your opponent chains to the effect of “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” with an effect that causes you to have cards in your hand (such as “Conscription”), then the effect of “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” disappears because you must still have no cards when resolving the effect.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO CAPTAIN GOLD  
> ① You can discard this card to the Graveyard to add 1 "Skyscraper" from your Deck to your hand. ② If this card is on the field but "Skyscraper" is not on the field, destroy this card.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves in the hand.
    *   Discarding this card is a cost.
    *   This effect cannot activate while "Dimensional Fissure" is active.
    *   This effect can only add the card named "Skyscraper", it cannot add "Skyscraper 2".
*   The ② Continuous Effect destroys this card without using the Chain.
    *   If this face-down monster is attacked, and "Skyscraper" is not active, destroy this card at the start of Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation.
    *   If "Skyscraper" leaves the field while resolving a Chain, destroy Captain Gold immediately before resolving the next effect in the Chain.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO CHAOS NEOS

*   Monsters Set by the effect of “Elemental Hero Chaos Neos” are Set in Defense Position.
*   “Elemental Hero Chaos Neos” can be Special Summoned from the Graveyard if it was first Special Summoned according to its text and sent to the Graveyard afterwards. “Elemental Hero Chaos Neos” can also be Special Summoned from the Removed Zone if it was Special Summoned according to its text and then removed from play afterwards.
*   If “Elemental Hero Chaos Neos” is destroyed before it can return to the Extra Deck by its own effect, the effect of Setting every face-up monster on the field disappears.
*   You can activate the coin toss effect of “Elemental Hero Chaos Neos” even while there are no monsters on your opponent’s side of the field.
*   If you activate the coin toss effect of “Elemental Hero Chaos Neos” and get 2 Heads, if “Elemental Hero Chaos Neos” is flipped face-down or removed from the field the effects of all face-up monsters on your opponent’s side of the field will still be negated.
*   The effect of returning “Elemental Hero Chaos Neos” to the Extra Deck and Setting all face-up monsters on the field are one effect. If “Elemental Hero Chaos Neos” is not returned to the Extra Deck (because of “Neo Space”, etc.) face-up monsters on the field will not be Set.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO DARK NEOS

*   If this card was Special Summoned properly by its own effect, then you can Special Summon it from the Graveyard with “Call of the Haunted”, etc.
*   If you control your opponent’s “Elemental Hero Neos” or “Neo-Spacian”, you can return it to your opponent’s Deck to Special Summon this card.
*   This card’s effect activates during every End Phase. If this card is not face-up on the field during the End Phase of the turn it was Special Summoned, its effect will still activate during the next End Phase that it is face-up on the field for, and be returned to the Extra Deck.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO DARKBRIGHT

*   If this card is destroyed and removed from play (by "Bottomless Trap Hole", etc.) its effect to destroy 1 monster your opponent controls activates.
*   If this card is destroyed by battle, its effect to destroy 1 monster your opponent controls activates when this card is sent to the Graveyard.
*   This effect will activate if this card is destroyed while it is being treated as a Spell Card (by "Relinquished", etc.).

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO DIVINE NEOS

*   Removing 1 "Neos", "Neo-Spacian", "Elemental Hero", "Destiny Hero", or "Evil Hero" monster in your Graveyard from play is a cost.
*   You can remove from play a Normal Monster "Neos" or "Elemental Hero" monster to activate the effect of "Elemental Hero Divine Neos". In this case "Elemental Hero Divine Neos" will not gain any effects.
*   If you use "Elemental Hero Neos" as a Fusion Material Monster, it can be used as a "Neos" monster or an "Elemental Hero" monster, but it cannot be used as both at the same time. If you use it as a "Neos" monster, you will still need another "Elemental Hero", "Destiny Hero" or "Evil Hero" monster.
*   "Neo-Spacian" monsters cannot be used as "Neos" Fusion Material Monsters.
*   If you remove "Evil Hero Dark Gaia" to activate the effect of "Elemental Hero Divine Neos", the original ATK of "Elemental Hero Divine Neos'" does not change.
*   If you return "Elemental Hero Divine Neos" to your Extra Deck by using "Contact Out", you cannot Special Summon the Fusion Material Monsters used to Fusion Summon it because the Fusion Material Monsters listed on "Elemental Hero Divine Neos" are not specificly named cards.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO FLAME WINGMAN

*   The damage inflicted by the effect of “Elemental Hero Flame Wingman” is based on the ATK of the destroyed monster in the Graveyard. So it’s the original ATK of the monster.
*   The effect of “Elemental Hero Flame Wingman” is activated when the monster destroyed in battle by it is sent to the Graveyard. You can chain to this effect.
*   If your “Elemental Hero Flame Wingman” destroys your monster that your opponent controlled, the effect is still activated and you inflict the effect damage to your opponent’s Life Points.
*   If your “Elemental Hero Flame Wingman” destroys a “Fusilier Dragon, the Dual-Mode Beast” that was Summoned without Tribute, inflict 2800 damage to your opponent’s Life Points.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO FLARE NEOS

*   If this card was Special Summoned properly by its own effect, then you can Special Summon it from the Graveyard with “Call of the Haunted”, etc.
*   If you control your opponent’s “Elemental Hero Neos” or “Neo-Spacian”, you can return it to your opponent’s Deck to Special Summon this card.
*   This card’s effect activates during every End Phase. If this card is not face-up on the field during the End Phase of the turn it was Special Summoned, its effect will still activate during the next End Phase that it is face-up on the field for, and be returned to the Extra Deck.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO GAIA  
> 1 "Elemental Hero" monster + 1 EARTH Monster  
Ⓒ This monster cannot be Special Summoned except by Fusion Summon. ① When this card is Fusion Summoned, select 1 face-up monster your opponent controls. Until the end of this turn, that monster's ATK is halved and this card gains the same amount of ATK.

*   Fusion Material must be 1 "Elemental Hero" (NOT "Destiny Hero" / "Evil Hero") + 1 EARTH monster.
    *   The EARTH monster can be a "Destiny Hero" / "Evil Hero" monster.
*   The Ⓒ Condition restricts how this card can be Special Summoned.
    *   This card CANNOT be Special Summoned from the Graveyard / removed from play.
    *   This card CANNOT be Special Summoned from the Extra Deck by "[Summoner of Illusions](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Summoner_of_Illusions)".
*   The ① Trigger Effect is mandatory.
    *   This effect targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.
    *   This effect does not apply if either Hero Gaia or the target is flipped face-down / leaves the field.
    *   These ATK changes last until the End Phase.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO GLOW NEOS

*   This card’s final effect is an Ignition Effect. It targets 1 card controlled by the opponent.
*   If you target a Token Monster with this effect, the additional effect (“This card cannot battle this turn.”) is not applied because the Token is not treated as a monster after it is destroyed.
*   If you destroy a monster that is being treated as an Equip Spell Card by the effect of “Relinquished”, it is treated as a monster after it is destroyed so the additional effect for destroying a Monster Card is applied.
*   If you destroy “Embodiment of Apophis”, it is treated as a Trap Card after it is destroyed, so the additional effect for destroying a Trap Card is applied.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO GRAND NEOS

*   This card’s effect that returns a monster to the hand is an Ignition Effect.
*   This effect targets 1 monster your opponent controls.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO MARINE NEOS

*   This card's effect does not target.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO MARINER

*   If you have a face-down Field Spell Card, but no face-down cards in your Spell & Trap Card Zones, you cannot attack directly with “Elemental Hero Mariner’s” effect.
*   If you control “Relinquished” equipped with a face-down Monster Card, that card is face-down in your Spell & Trap Card Zone, so “Elemental Hero Mariner” can attack directly.
*   If your only face-down card is “Rush Recklessly”, you can attack directly, and then during the DAMAGE STEP, activate “Rush Recklessly” and the direct attack will continue. This is because Replays do not usually occur during the Damage Step.
*   If your opponent controls a monster equipped with “Ring of Magnetism”, then “Elemental Hero Mariner” cannot attack directly.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO NECROID SHAMAN

*   The controller of “Elemental Hero Necroid Shaman” chooses which monster to Special Summon and what battle position to Special Summon it in. You can choose to Special Summon the monster that you destroyed.
*   You cannot choose to Special Summon a monster if it cannot be Special Summoned, such as a Spirit monster, or “Dark Ruler Ha Des”, or a Fusion Monster that was Summoned by the effect of “Metamorphosis”.
*   If you did not destroy a monster with “Elemental Hero Necroid Shaman’s” effect then you do not Special Summon a monster from your opponent’s Graveyard. This includes if an effect is chained that prevents the selected monster from being destroyed.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO NECROSHADE

*   You can combine the effects of “Elemental Hero Necroshade” and “Ultimate Offering” to Normal Summon an “Elemental Hero” without Tribute using the effect of “Ultimate Offering”.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO NEO BUBBLEMAN

*   If “Skill Drain” is active, this card is no longer treated as “Elemental Hero Bubbleman”.
*   You can have 3 “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” and 3 “Elemental Hero Neo Bubbleman” in your Deck and Side Deck combined.
*   If your Defense Position “Elemental Hero Neo Bubbleman” is attacked by “Drillroid”, damage calculation is not conducted, so “Elemental Hero Neo Bubbleman” did not “battle” and its effect will not activate.
*   If you Special Summon this card you can activate “Inferno Reckless Summon” and Special Summon “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” from your Deck.
*   While this card is face-up on the field, it can be used as “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” for a Fusion Summon (but not while in your hand).
*   The effect of “Elemental Hero Neo Bubbleman” that makes it treated as “Elemental Hero Bubbleman” is a Continuous Effect. The effect that destroys a monster that battles it is a Trigger Effect.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO PRISMA
> ① Once per turn, you can reveal 1 Fusion Monster from your Fusion Deck and send 1 of the Fusion Material Monsters listed on that card from your Deck to the Graveyard. Until the End Phase, this card’s name is treated as the sent monster’s name.

*   The ① Ignition Effect has no activation cost.
    *   When this effect resolves: reveal a Fusion Monster and send a named Fusion Material Monster.
    *   Prisma only gains the printed name, it will not gain categories (such as Tuner, Toon, Spirit, etc).
    *   This effect can be activated while "Dimensional Fissure" is active. The Fusion Material Monster is removed from play as it is sent to the Graveyard, and Prisma gains its printed name.
    *   If an effect is chained that removes "Elemental Hero Prisma" from the field or flips it face-down, "Elemental Hero Prisma"'s effect disappears. You do not reveal a Fusion Monster or send one of the listed Fusion Material Monsters to the Graveyard \[[REF](http://web.archive.org/web/20080703055137/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/COMMUNITY/forums/thread/1215851.aspx)\].
    *   VS. "Rainbow Neos": you may only send "Elemental Hero Neos". You cannot send "Rainbow Dragon" or "Rainbow Dark Dragon", as "Rainbow Neos" actually lists "1 'Ultimate Crystal' monster" as the other Fusion Material \[[REF](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Rainbow_Neos)\].  
        

## ELEMENTAL HERO RAMPART BLASTER

*   When using this card’s effect to attack from Defense Position, you apply half of its current ATK. So if it equipped with “Axe of Despair”, you would apply 1500 ATK for damage calculation.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO STORM NEOS

*   "Elemental Hero Storm Neos'" effect that destroys Spell and Trap Cards is an Ignition Effect.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO STRATOS  
> ① When this card is Normal or Special Summoned, you can select and activate 1 of these effects:  
Ⓐ Destroy Spell or Trap Cards on the field up to the number of "Elemental Hero", "Destiny Hero" and "Evil Hero" monsters you control (not counting this card).  
Ⓑ Select and add 1 "Elemental Hero", "Destiny Hero" or "Evil Hero" from your Deck to your hand.

*   The ① optional "_When... you can..._" Trigger Effect (both Ⓐ and Ⓑ) can miss the timing.
    *   This effect (both Ⓐ and Ⓑ) CAN be activated during the Damage Step.
    *   When this effect triggers, you declare which (if either) effect you are activating.
*   The Ⓐ effect does NOT target Spell / Trap Cards on the field. "Starlight Road" cannot be chained.
    *   This effect CANNOT be activated if Stratos is the only "HERO" monster you control.
    *   Your other face-up "Elemental / Destiny / Evil Hero" monsters are counted when this effect resolves.
    *   This effect does not count "Hero Kid" towards your face up HERO monsters.
*   The Ⓑ effect CANNOT be activated while "Thunder King Rai-Oh" is face-up on the field.
    *   This effect cannot add "Hero Kid".

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO TEMPEST

*   This card’s effect is an Ignition Effect that targets. Sending 1 card from your side of the field to the Graveyard is a cost to active the effect.
*   You cannot use a Monster Token for the cost because they are not sent to the Graveyard.
*   You can use this effect multiple times, but the same monster cannot be targeted with this effect twice.
*   “While this card is face-up on the field” means “while this Elemental Hero Tempest is face-up on the field”. Not while the selected monster is face-up on the field.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO THUNDER GIANT

*   The effect of “Elemental Hero Thunder Giant” targets a monster.
*   Discarding a card for this effect is a cost.
*   This effect can be chained to.
*   If the effect of “Elemental Hero Thunder Giant” is activated, targeting “King of the Skull Servants” with 2000 original ATK, and the opponent chains “Curse of Aging” and discards “Skull Servant” to activate it, then “King of the Skull Servants” has 3000 original ATK and is not destroyed.

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO VOLTIC  
> ① When this card inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent, you can Special Summon 1 of your removed from play "Elemental Hero" monsters.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation.
    *   This effect targets the "Elemental Hero" you intend to Special Summon.
    *   You CANNOT Special Summon monsters with Conditions like "[Elemental Hero Mudballman](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Elemental_HERO_Mudballman)".
    *   This effect does not activate if you inflict 0 Battle Damage (by "Waboku").

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO WILDEDGE

*   This monster cannot attack the opponent directly after attacking a monster(s).

  
## ELEMENTAL HERO WILDHEART  
> ① This card is unaffected by the effects of Trap Cards.

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   Apply this effect while Wildheart is face-up; not in the hand / Deck / Graveyard / removed from play.
    *   This card can still be targeted by the effects of Trap Cards, but is unaffected by their effects.
    *   This card is not destroyed by “Call of the Haunted”.
    *   This card is not removed from play by “Return from the Different Dimension”.
    *   This card inflicts no Battle Damage while "Waboku" applies (it affects the Damage, not Wildheart).
    *   VS. “Skill Drain”: whichever effect was active on the field first takes precedence. So if “Elemental Hero Wildheart” is on the field and “Skill Drain” is activated, his effect is not negated. But if “Skill Drain” is on the field and “Elemental Hero Wildheart” is Summoned, his effect is negated by “Skill Drain” as long as “Skill Drain” remains on the field.

  
## ELEMENTAL MISTRESS DORIADO

*   The effect of “Elemental Mistress Doriado” is a Continuous Effect, and it is only applied while she’s face-up on the field.
*   You can activate “Fuh-Rin-Ka-Zan” if “Elemental Mistress Doriado” is face-up on the field (no other monsters are required).
*   “Elemental Burst” requires 4 Tributes. A face-up “Elemental Mistress Doriado” can be used as 1 of the 4, but you will still need to Tribute 3 other monsters of the appropriate Attributes.
*   If “Scroll of Bewitchment” or “DNA Transplant” changes the Attribute of “Elemental Mistress Doriado”, her Attribute becomes that Attribute only. (Her effect is not applied.)

  
## ELEPHANT STATUE OF BLESSING

*   "Elephant Statue of Blessing" must be sent from the owner's hand to the owner's Graveyard in order for its effect to activate.
*   "Elephant Statue of Blessing"'s effect can be activated during the Damage Step.
*   "Elephant Statue of Blessing"'s effect activates when sent from the hand to the Graveyard by the effect of "Last Turn" or "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End".

  
## ELEPHANT STATUE OF DISASTER

*   "Elephant Statue of Disaster" must be sent from the owner's hand to the owner's Graveyard in order for its effect to activate.
*   "Elephant Statue of Disaster"'s effect can be activated during the Damage Step.
*   "Elephant Statue of Disaster"'s effect activates when sent from the hand to the Graveyard by the effect of "Last Turn" or "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End".
*   You can use "Barrel Behind the Door" against the effect of "Elephant Statue of Disaster".

  
## ELIMINATING THE LEAGUE

*   Discarding a Spell Card is a cost to activate this card.
*   This effect targets the opponent’s monster.
*   If the targeted monster is not destroyed by “Eliminating the League’s” effect, you cannot resolve the second part of this card’s effect (and you do not get to look at your opponent’s hand).
*   If a different “Six Samurai” is destroyed instead of the target, you cannot resolve the second part of “Eliminating the League’s” effect.

  
## EMBODIMENT OF APOPHIS

*   Once “Embodiment of Apophis” has been activated, it takes up 1 Monster Card Zone and 1 Spell & Trap Card Zone. The physical location of “Embodiment of Apophis” should be on the Monster Card Zones, however.
*   If your Monster Card Zones are all full you cannot activate “Embodiment of Apophis”. If your Spell & Trap Card Zones are all full you cannot take control of your opponent’s “Embodiment of Apophis” because you will need 1 Monster Card Zone and 1 Spell & Trap Card Zone for it.
*   If your opponent has no vacant Spell & Trap Card Zones, you cannot give them “Embodiment of Apophis” for “Creature Swap”. If “Embodiment of Apophis” is your only monster in such a case, neither player can activate “Creature Swap”.
*   You can activate “Embodiment of Apophis” during your opponent’s Main Phase, or your own.
*   While “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, it is still treated as a Trap Card and can be destroyed by “Heavy Storm” or “Mystical Space Typhoon”.
*   If an effect that destroys Trap Cards is used against “Embodiment of Apophis”, you can use “Fake Trap” to prevent it from being destroyed. When preventing the destruction of “Embodiment of Apophis”, you must be using a card of the appropriate type. You cannot use “My Body as a Shield” to rescue it from “Heavy Storm”. You cannot use “Fake Trap” to rescue it from “Raigeki”. You can use “Riryoku Field” when “Embodiment of Apophis” is targeted by “Snatch Steal”, but not when it’s targeted by “Mystical Space Typhoon”. You can use any of these effects to protect “Embodiment of Apophis” from “Raigeki Break” because “Raigeki Break” can destroy a Monster card or a Trap Card.
*   vs. “Jinzo”: If “Emodiment of Apophis” is a monster, and “Jinzo” or “Royal Decree” is played, “Embodiment of Apophis” cannot remain as a monster and is placed face-up in the Spell & Trap Card Zone, where it remains on the field meaninglessly (even if “Jinzo” leaves play later). If “Royal Decree” is chained to the activation of “Embodiment of Apophis”, the effect of “Embodiment of Apophis” is negated and it remains on the field in the Spell & Trap Card Zone meaninglessly.
*   If “Embodiment of Apophis” attacks a face-down “Jinzo”, once “Jinzo” is flipped face-up, “Embodiment of Apophis” reverts to a Trap Card. Damage calculation is not applied.
*   If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, and is flipped face-down, it goes back to the Spell & Trap Card Zone as a Trap Card (vertically, since Trap Cards do not have battle positions). You cannot activate “Embodiment of Apophis” that same turn, because it is a Trap Card that was just Set.
*   When “Embodiment of Apophis” is sent to the Graveyard, it is sent as a Trap Card and remains treated as a Trap Card. You cannot revive it with “Monster Reborn” or retrieve it with “Return of the Doomed”. It will not trigger “Last Will”. You cannot activate “Michizure”. It will not be Special Summoned by “Red-Moon Baby”. No damage is inflicted by “KA-2 Des Scissors” or “Inferno” or “Fatal Abacus”. “Emes the Infinity” does not increase its ATK. No Life Points are increased by “Absorbing Kid from the Sky”. You would not gain Life Points for “Altar for Tribute”. (You can, however, now add it back to your hand with “Mask of Darkness”.)
*   If your opponent controls your “Embodiment of Apophis” as a monster with “Snatch Steal” or “Creature Swap”, and it is flipped face-down, it goes to your opponent’s Spell & Trap Card Zone because he is the controller.
*   If your opponent controls your “Embodiment of Apophis” as a monster with “Snatch Steal”, and “Jinzo” is Summoned, it returns to your Spell & Trap Card Zone and remains there meaninglessly. If your opponent controls your “Embodiment of Apophis” as a monster because of “Creature Swap”, and “Jinzo” is Summoned, it is placed on your opponent’s Spell & Trap Card Zone and remains there meaninglessly.
*   “Embodiment of Apophis” is considered a Normal Monster. It does not inflict damage for “Ceasefire”. You can use “Delta Attacker” if you have 3 “Embodiment of Apophis” monsters. You can Tribute “Embodiment of Apophis” for “Sword of the Soul-Eater” while it is a monster.
*   If “Non-Spellcasting Area” is active, “Embodiment of Apophis” cannot be destroyed by “Raigeki”, etc., but can still be destroyed by “Heavy Storm” or “Mystical Space Typhoon”.
*   “Embodiment of Apophis”, while a monster, has original ATK 1600 and original DEF 1800 (for purposes of “Megamorph”, etc.).
*   You can negate the activation of “Embodiment of Apophis” by chaining “Solemn Judgment” or “7 Tools of the Bandit” or “Royal Oppression”, but you cannot use these against it once it is a monster.
*   When “Embodiment of Apophis” is Special Summoned, you can activate “Torrential Tribute” just like with any other Summon.
*   You can use “Chain Destruction” when “Embodiment of Apophis” is Special Summoned, and “Chain Destruction” will destroy all copies of “Embodiment of Apophis” in the hand and Deck even though they are Trap Cards.
*   You can use “Embodiment of Apophis” as a Tribute once it is a monster. You cannot Tribute it for a Ritual Summon, etc., while it is in your hand.
*   If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster and “Morphing Jar #2” is activated, “Embodiment of Apophis” is shuffled into the Deck as a Trap Card, so it does NOT count towards the number of monsters you need to pick up. (Also, if you pick up “Embodiment of Apophis” for the effect of “Morphing Jar #2”, it is not counted as a monster and will be one of the cards sent to the Graveyard.)
*   If you pick up “Embodiment of Apophis” for “Cyber Jar”, it is added to your hand.
*   If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster and is equipped to “Relinquished”, “Embodiment of Apophis” is treated as any other monster equipped to “Relinquished”, and “Relinquished” gets 1600 ATK and 1800 DEF.
*   If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, “Giant Trunade” will still return it to the owner’s hand.
*   When “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, and is returned to the hand by “Penguin Soldier”, etc., it is returned as a Trap Card. So you cannot activate “Major Riot”.
*   You can target “Embodiment of Apophis” with “Monster Recovery” while it is a monster, and return it to the Deck.
*   If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, and you use “Magical Hats” with it, it returns to your Spell & Trap Card Zone face-down. The other effects of “Magical Hats” apply normally.
*   If “Embodiment of Apophis” battles “D.D. Warrior Lady” and her effect is activated, both will be removed from play.
*   If you select “Embodiment of Apophis” as your monster for “Last Turn”, it is not sent to the Graveyard even though “Last Turn” sends all other cards to the Graveyard.
*   If you control “Theban Nightmare” and “Embodiment of Apophis”, you control a Trap Card so the effect of “Theban Nightmare” cannot be applied.
*   If you change “Embodiment of Apophis” to Machine-Type and use “Limiter Removal”, then “Jinzo” is Summoned later that turn and “Embodiment of Apophis” switches back to a Trap Card, “Embodiment of Apophis” is not destroyed in the End Phase by “Limiter Removal”.
*   If you use “Dimensionhole” or “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” against “Embodiment of Apophis”, it returns to the field as a Trap Card and is destroyed immediately. If “Dimensionhole” was used, you cannot use the Monster Card Zone while “Embodiment of Apophis” is removed from play, but you can use the Spell & Trap Card Zone it was occupying.

  
## EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE

*   This effect targets 1 monster.
*   A monster that was destroyed while being treated as a Spell Card can be Summoned by this effect.
*   You can only Special Summon a monster if it is Level 4 while in the Graveyard.
*   You can Special Summon monsters that were destroyed while they were in your hand or Deck.

  
## EMERGENCY PROVISIONS

*   Sending Spell and Trap Cards on your side of the field to the Graveyard is a cost for activating this card.
*   You can activate a Normal Spell Card, such as "Raigeki", then chain "Emergency Provisions" and send "Raigeki" to the Graveyard to gain 1000 Life Points, and the effect of "Raigeki" will still resolve.
*   If your opponent activates "Heavy Storm" you can chain "Emergency Provisions" to send your Spell and Trap Cards to Graveyard first (and gain the appropriate amount of Life Points).
*   You gain the Life Points from this card’s effect in one lump sum, so if you control "Fire Princess" her effect will only inflict 500 points of damage.
*   The effect of this card does not "destroy" your Spell and Trap Cards; it "sends them to the Graveyard." So, for example, you may send a Spell Card to the Graveyard with a counter on it from "Magic Reflector". You can also send "Fusion Sword Murasame Blade" even though it cannot be "destroyed".
*   If you control a monster equipped with "Premature Burial" and you send "Premature Burial" to the Graveyard to activate "Emergency Provisions" the equipped monster is not destroyed, because "Premature Burial" was not destroyed. The same is true for Toon Monsters: if you send "Toon World" to the Graveyard with "Emergency Provisions", Toon Monsters you control are not destroyed.
*   If you send "Smoke Grenade of the Thief" or "Blast with Chain" to the Graveyard for the cost of "Emergency Provisions" their effects do not activate, because they were not destroyed.
*   If you send "Black Pendant" to the Graveyard for the cost of "Emergency Provisions" its effect does activate.
*   While "Banisher of the Light" is face-up on the field, you cannot activate "Emergency Provisions" since it is impossible to send cards to the Graveyard.
*   If you have "Imperial Order" active on your side of the field, you may send it to the Graveyard as part of the cost to activate "Emergency Provisions" and "Emergency Provisions" will not be negated.

  
## EMERGENCY TELEPORT

*   Removing the Special Summoned Psychic-Type Monster from play does not start a Chain.

  
## EMISSARY FROM PANDEMONIUM

*   You cannot Set “Emissary from Pandemonium” by Tributing just 1 monster. The restriction against Special Summoning “Emissary from Pandemonium” is not an ‘effect’. The ability to Normal Summon “Emissary from Pandemonium” with 1 Tribute is not an effect. If Normal Summoned with 1 Tribute, the halved ATK/DEF are treated as the original ATK/DEF.

  
## EMISSARY OF THE AFTERLIFE

*   If neither player has a Level 3 or lower Normal Monster in their Deck, the effect of "Emissary of the Afterlife" disappears BUT both players get to look at their opponent's Decks before they are shuffled.
*   If only 1 player as a Level 3 or lower Normal Monster in their Deck, then that player gets to add the monster to his hand.
*   You select monsters when the effect resolves. The effect of "Emissary of the Afterlife" does not target.

  
## EMISSARY OF THE OASIS

*   "Emissary of the Oasis"' last sentence applies even when your opponent attacks with a Level 3 or lower Normal Monster; the Battle Damage to you becomes zero.
*   If you have "Emissary of the Oasis" with "Raregold Armor", and a Level 3 or lower Normal Monster, your opponent cannot attack.
*   A Monster Token is a Normal Monster, but a Ritual Monster without an effect is not a Normal Monster.

  
## EMPEROR SEM

*   If you activate the effect of “Emperor Sem,” you need to return a card from your Graveyard to the top of your Deck.
*   Your opponent does not have to use its effect, but can do so if they wish.
*   Each player targets 1 card in their Graveyard for “Emperor Sem’s” effect.
*   If you have at least 1 card in your Graveyard, you can activate “Emperor Sem’s” effect even if your opponent has no cards in their Graveyard.
*   “Emperor Sem’s” effect starts a Chain. If an effect is chained that shifts control of the Tribute Summoned monster to your opponent, “Emperor Sem’s” effect resolves as normal. However, if control of “Emperor Sem” shifts to the opponent as part of the Chain, the effect of “Emperor Sem” is not applied because it is no longer a case where ‘you Tribute Summoned a monster’, as “you” now refers to your opponent.

  
## ENCHANTING FITTING ROOM

*   If you have no vacant monster zones, you cannot Special Summon with "Enchanting Fitting Room". So the Level 3 or lower Normal Monsters that would be Special Summoned are sent to the Graveyard instead. All other cards are still returned to the Deck and it is shuffled.
*   If you have some vacant Monster Card Zones, but not enough, select the monsters you wish to Summon with "Enchanting Fitting Room" and Special Summon them.

  
## ENEMY CONTROLLER  
> Select and activate 1 of these effects:  
● ① Change the Battle Position of 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.  
● ② Tribute 1 monster. Select 1 face-up monster your opponent controls. Take control of it until the End Phase.

*   If you activate either of "Enemy Controller"'s effects, and your opponent chains "Book of Moon" to flip the target monster face-down, its targeting conditions are no longer correct when "Enemy Controller" resolves and "Enemy Controller"'s effect disappears.
*   The ① effect targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.
    *   You can activate this effect while you have no monster on your side of the field.
*   The ② effect targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls
    *   Tributing a monster is a cost.
    *   The monster you gain control of is returned during the End Phase, even if it was flipped face-down (by "Book of Moon") or leaves the field (by "Interdimensional Matter Transporter").
    *   If you gain control of your opponent's "Judgment Dragon" during their turn, control is retored before the End Phase concludes (with the end of turn discard), and the turn player will be prompted to activate the mandatory trigger effect to send the top 4 cards of their Deck to the Graveyard. This also applies to other Lightsworn monster with a mandatory end phase trigger effect to send the top cards of the Deck to the Graveyard) \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/85182-judgment-dragon-and-enemy-controller/)\].

  
## ENERGY BRAVERY

*   If you Summon a Gemini monster from your Graveyard with “Swing of Memories” while “Energy Bravery” is on the field, and you Normal Summon that monster again, it will not be destroyed during the End Phase.
*   If a Gemini monster that is being treated as an Effect Monster is destroyed at the same time as “Energy Bravery” the effect of “Energy Bravery” will still apply and protect the Gemini monster.

  
## ENERGY DRAIN

*   When "Hayabusa Knight", boosted by "Energy Drain", attacks, and the opponent's hand is reduced during the battle, the ATK of "Hayabusa Knight" for the second attack is not changed because the effect of "Energy Drain" is determined when "Energy Drain" resolves.

  
## ENERGY-ABSORBING MONOLITH

*   The “Energy-Absorbing Monolith” does not increase your Life Points with its own effect. Instead, it changes what the damage inflicting card would have done, so that you gain Life Points instead of taking damage.
*   If you activate “Energy-Absorbing Monolith” while your opponent has “Bad Reaction to Simoichi” face-up on their side of the field, instead of gaining Life Points you will receive damage due to the effect of “Bad Reaction to Simochi”.
*   If you chain “Energy-Absorbing Monolith” to “Ring of Destruction”, when the monster is destroyed you will gain Life Points equal to the destroyed monster’s ATK and your opponent will receive damage equal to the destroyed monster’s ATK.

  
## ENERVATING MIST

*   If "Enervating Mist" and "Infinite Cards" are both active, whichever effect resolved last is dominant.

  
## ENLIGHTENMENT

*   This effect does not target. The Spellcaster-Type monster that destroyed the opponent’s monster must survive the battle in order for you to activate “Enlightenment.”

  
## ENRAGED BATTLE OX

*   For "Enraged Battle Ox"'s effect to activate, the attacked monster must be in Defense Position during damage calculation. So if "Final Attack Orders" is active, "Enraged Battle Ox"'s effect will not be applied.

  
## EQUIP SHOT

*   "Equip Shot" cannot be activated during the Damage Step or End Step.
*   The Attack Position monster selected by "Equip Shot" must be a legal target for the selected Equip Card. If no legal targets exist, "Equip Shot" cannot be activated.
*   The selected Equip Card remains under your control when it is equipped to your opponent's monster.
*   You can select a monster that has already attacked. If you select a monster that has not attacked it may conduct its regular attack after the battle caused by "Equip Shot".
*   If your opponent attacks with one monster (monster A) and you activate "Equip Shot", selecting another of their monsters (monster B), the original attacking monster (monster A) cannot attack after the battle caused by "Equip Shot", but the monster selected by "Equip Shot" (monster B) may attack after the battle created by "Equip Shot".
*   When "Equip Shot" resolves, the battle caused by "Equip Shot" proceeds directly to the Damage Step.
*   If you activate "Equip Shot" during your Battle Phase, your monster is the attacker. If you activate it during your opponent's Battle Phase, your opponent's monster is the attacker.
*   If an effect is chained that switches the monster that would be the attacker into Defense Position, the selected Equip Card is still transferred but the battle is not conducted, unless the monster can attack while in Defense Position like "Total Defense Shogun".
*   If one of the monsters affected by "Equip Shot" cannot attack, the Equip Card is still transferred.

  
## ERADICATOR EPIDEMIC VIRUS  
> Tribute 1 DARK monster with 2500 or more ATK, and choose Spell Cards or Trap Cards. ① Check all Spell and Trap Cards on your opponent's side of the field, your opponent's hand, and all cards they draw (until the end of your opponent's 3rd turn after this card's activation), and destroy all cards of the chosen type.

*   This card's cost Tributes a DARK monster with 2500 or more ATK.
    *   Face-down DARK monsters can be Tributed (like a Set "[Fusilier Dragon, the Dual-Mode Beast](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fusilier_Dragon,_the_Dual-Mode_Beast)").
    *   An opponent's face-down monster targeted by "[Soul Exchange](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Soul_Exchange)" cannot be Tributed.
*   You must choose Spell Cards or Trap Cards when you activate this card.
*   The ① Effect applies destroys all cards simultaneously.
    *   Any card treated as a Spell Card (by "Relinquished", a Set "Toy Magician") will be destroyed.
    *   If you declare Trap and your opponent's only face-down card is "Fake Trap", the cannot activate it.
*   Resolving the Lingering Effect does not start a Chain.
    *   You only check the cards on the field and in the hand when "Eradicator Epidemic Virus" is resolved.
    *   Only cards drawn are checked until the end of your opponent's third End Phase.
    *   If you draw a Spell / Trap Card(s) (ex: "Book of Moon") in your Draw Phase, it is destroyed immediately and cannot be chained (because this does not start a Chain).
    *   If you draw a Spell / Trap Card(s) by card effect (ex: "Morphing Jar"), resolve that effect first, then destroy any Spell / Trap Cards (whichever declared) drawn.
    *   If "Eradicator Epidemic Virus" is activated on your turn, the "first turn" lasts until the end of your opponent’s next turn.
*   The Lingering Effect of "Eradicator Epidemic Virus" DOES NOT DESTROY:
    *   cards added to the hand (by "King of the Swamp").
    *   cards you receive from your opponent (by "Exchange").
*   VS. "[Starlight Road](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Starlight_Road)":
    *   You CAN activate "Starlight Road" if at least two face-up Spell / Trap Cards (whichever declared) would be destroyed.
    *   You CANNOT activate "Starlight Road" if your two Spell / Trap Cards (whichever declared) that would be destroyed are face-down.
    *   You CANNOT activate "Starlight Road" if you have 1 face-up Spell Card and 1 face-up Trap card (even if there are others face-down) because "Eradicator Epidemic Virus" will only attempt to destroy cards of the declared type (Spell or Trap).

  
## ERIA THE WATER CHARMER

*   If your opponent chains “Enemy Controller” to the activation of the Flip Effect of a “Charmer”, and takes control of the “Charmer”, the Flip Effect disappears.
*   If you take control of the opponent’s monster with a “Charmer” and the opponent takes control back with “Change of Heart”, control still reverts to you after the effect of “Change of Heart” expires (even though it wasn’t your monster originally).
*   If your opponent takes control of your monster with “Snatch Steal”, and you activate the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to take it back, you keep control while the “Charmer” is face-up on the field.
*   If “Book of Moon” is chained to the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to flip the target monster face-down, the effect of the “Charmer” disappears.
*   If a “Charmer” is removed from play with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, its effect is not re-applied when it’s back on the field.
*   If “DNA Transplant” changes a monster’s Attribute so that it can be taken by a “Charmer”, and then “DNA Transplant” is destroyed so that the monster’s Attribute no longer corresponds to the effect of the “Charmer”, the controller of the “Charmer” loses control of the monster.
*   If the turn player controls a “Charmer” and a monster controlled by its effect, and activates “Assault on GHQ” and targets the controlled monster, and the opponent chains an effect to destroy the “Charmer”, the controlled monster returns to the opponent’s control, but is still destroyed by the effect of “Assault on GHQ”.

  
## ESCAPE FROM THE DARK DIMENSION

*   "Escape from the Dark Dimension" targets 1 of your removed from play DARK Monsters.
*   If your opponent removes 1 of your DARK Monsters from play temporarily, you can select it with "Escape from the Dark Dimension".

  
## ETOILE CYBER

*   This card’s effect is a Continuous Effect that cannot be chained to.

  
## EVERLIVING UNDERWORLD CANNON

*   "Everliving Underworld Cannon"'s effect is a Trigger Effect.
*   "Everliving Underworld Cannon"'s effect always activates the first time a Zombie-Type monster is Special Summoned onto your side of the field during each turn.

  
## EVIL BLAST

*   “Evil Blast” targets the monster that you equip it to.
*   You cannot activate “Evil Blast” during the Damage Step.
*   When “Evil Blast” is equipped to a monster, you can switch it to a different monster with “Tailor of the Fickle.”
*   The effect that deals damage starts a Chain.
*   You can activate “Evil Blast” even if multiple monsters are Special Summoned at the same time.

  
## EVIL HERO DARK GAIA  
> 1 Fiend-Type monster + 1 Rock-Type monster  
Ⓒ This card cannot be Special Summoned except with "Dark Fusion". ① The original ATK of this card is equal to the combined ATK of the Fusion Material Monsters used to Fusion Summon it. ② When this card declares an attack, change all Defense Position monsters your opponent controls to face-up Attack Position. Flip Effects are not activated at this time.

*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated.
    *   ONLY "Dark Fusion" / "Dark Calling" can Special Summon this card.
    *   This card cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard / Removed from Play area.
    *   Fusion Material substitutes (ex: "King of the Swamp") CANNOT be used because this card does not specifically name cards (it specifies "1 Fiend-Type monster + 1 Rock-Type monster").
*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   If "Evil Hero Dark Gaia" is flipped face-down / leaves the field, its ATK becomes 0.
    *   Determinine the ATK of "Evil HERO Dark Gaia" using the monsters' total Original (printed) ATK.
    *   Fusion Material Monster's with "? ATK" are treated as having "0 ATK".
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect activates in at the Start of the Battle Step - Attack Declaration.
    *   This is the same activation timing as "Mirror Force".
    *   Turn player priority makes this effect Chain Link 1, but your opponent can chain "Mirror Force".
*   VS. "[Necro Gardna](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Necro_Gardna)": Attacks can only be negated in the Battle Step. If an attack is negated, the Damage Step does not occur (that monster is not treated as having "battled"), and that monster is still considered to have declared an attack that turn (it cannot declare another attack or change its battle position in Main Phase 2) \[[REF](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Negate)\]. If "Evil Hero Dark Gaia" declares an Attack, at the start of the Battle Step the turn player can activate "Evil Hero Dark Gaia"'s effect in response to the Attack declaration, and the non-turn player can activate "Necro Gardna"'s effect as Chain Link 2. When the chain resolves, "Necro Gardna" negates the Attack and prevents it from proceeding to the Damage Step, then "Evil Hero Dark Gaia"'s effect resolves forcing all the opponent's monsters into Attack Position without activating any Flip Effects. Even if "Necro Gardna"'s effect was activated before "Evil Hero Dark Gaia" declared an attack, "Evil Hero Dark Gaia" can still activate its effect when it declares an attack which is negated by "Necro Gardna".

  
## EVIL HERO INFERNAL GAINER

*   The Fiend-Type monster selected for “Evil Hero Infernal Gainer’s” effect can attack twice during the Battle Phase as long as it remains face-up on the field.
*   During your second Standby Phase after activating “Evil Hero Infernal Gainer’s” effect, if you have no available Monster Zone spaces when “Evil Hero Infernal Gainer’s” effect tries to Special Summon it onto your side of the field, the “Evil Hero Infernal Gainer” will be sent to the Graveyard.
*   After being removed from play by its own effect, if “Evil Hero Infernal Gainer” is removed from the Removed Zone (returned to the Graveyard, added to the Deck, etc.) its will not be Special Summoned during the second Standby Phase. Even if the “Evil Hero Infernal Gainer” is returned to the Removed Zone, it will still not be Special Summoned.
*   If, during your second Standby Phase after activating “Evil Hero Infernal Gainer’s” effect, your opponent negates the effect that Special Summons “Evil Hero Infernal Gainer”, it will not be Special Summoned during a later Standby Phase.

  
## EVIL HERO INFERNAL PRODIGY  
> Ⓢ If you control no monsters, you can Special Summon this card from your hand in face-up Attack Position. ① If you Tribute this card to Tribute Summon an "Elemental Hero", "Destiny Hero", or "Evil Hero" monster, draw 1 card during this turn's End Phase.

*   This Ⓢ Special Summon effect does not start a chain.
*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates during the End Phase.
    *   This effect ONLY ACTIVATES ONCE, even if Tributed for HERO monsters multiple times this turn.
    *   This effect WILL STILL activate if Prodigy is removed from play when Tributed (by "Macro Cosmos") or after it was Tributed (by "Soul Release").
*   The ① effect will NOT trigger if:
    *   after being Tributed, Prodigy is Special Summoned to the field prior to the End Phase.
    *   after being Tributed, Prodigy is shuffled into the Deck prior to the End Phase.
    *   after being Tributed, Prodigy was added to the hand prior to the End Phase.
    *   Prodigy is Tributed to Set a HERO monster.
    *   the Tribute Summon of a HERO monster was negated (by "Solemn Judgment").

  
## EVIL HERO INFERNO WING

*   The damage inflicted by “Evil Hero Inferno Wing” is determined when the destroyed monster is sent to the Graveyard, and due to this the damage inflicted will be based on the destroyed monsters original ATK or DEF.
*   If the destroyed monster’s ATK and DEF are equal, the effect of “Evil Hero Inferno Wing” will still activate and it will inflict damage equal to either the ATK or DEF. (since both are equal, it does not matter which is selected)

  
## EVIL HERO MALICIOUS EDGE

*   If your opponent controls only 1 monster and you activate “Soul Exchange”, selecting that 1 monster as the target, after resolving “Soul Exchange” you can Tribute that 1 monster to Tribute Summon “Evil Hero Malicious Edge” (You would not need to Tribute an additional monster).

  
## EVIL HERO MALICIOUS FIEND  
> "Evil Hero Malicious Edge" + 1 Level 6 or higher Fiend-Type monster  
Ⓒ This monster cannot be Special Summoned except with "Dark Fusion". ① During your opponent's Battle Phase, all monsters they control are changed to face-up Attack Position, and each monster they control must attack this card.

*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated.
    *   ONLY "Dark Fusion" / "Dark Calling" can Special Summon this card.
    *   This card cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard / Removed from Play area.
    *   Fusion Material substitutes (ex: "King of the Swamp") CAN be used in place of "Evil Hero Malicious Fiend", but NOT in place of "_1 Level 6 or higher Fiend-Type monster_".
*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate. It applies the entirety of your opponent's Battle Phase.
    *   All face-down monsters are flipped simultaneously. Flip Effects still activate and form a chain.
    *   If your opponent chooses not to conduct their Battle Phase, this effect is not applied.
    *   Monsters Special Summoned during your opponent's Battle Phase will be affected.
    *   If a monster's Battle Position is changed to Defense Position at the end of the Battle Phase ("Goblin Attack Force", etc.), it will be shifted into Attack Position.
    *   If you control 2+ "Evil Hero Malicious Fiend", you decide which one your opponent attacks.
    *   Only monsters that are able to attack must attack "Evil Hero Malicious Fiend". If you have "Swords of Revealing Light" and "Evil Hero Malicious Fiend" on your side of the field, your opponent's monsters are unable to attack, so they cannot attack "Evil Hero Malicious Fiend". If you have "Gravity Bind" and "Evil Hero Malicious Fiend" on your side of the field, your opponent's monsters of Level 4 or higher are unable to attack, so they cannot attack "Evil Hero Malicious Fiend".
    *   VS. "Level Limit - Area B": your opponent's monsters are changed to Attack Position and must attack "Evil Hero Malicious Fiend". If "Level Limit - Area B" is being negated and during the Battle Phase its effect is reapplied, the opponent's Level 4 or higher monsters change to Defense Position and are unable to attack.

  
## EVIL THORN

*   Tributing “Evil Thorn” is a cost to activate its effect.
*   If you activate the effect of “Evil Thorn,” inflicting damage is mandatory but Special Summoning is optional.
*   If you can’t Special Summon, due to a card effect, you can still Tribute “Evil Thorn” to inflict damage.
*   The timing on the 2 effects of “Evil Thorn” (inflicting damage and Special Summoning) are simultaneous. The effect ends after you have done both. If you have no “Evil Thorns” in your Deck, you can still Tribute “Evil Thorn” to inflict 300 damage.
*   The effects of the Special Summoned “Evil Thorns” are negated as long as they remain face-up on the field.

  
## EXCHANGE

*   You cannot activate "Exchange" if you have no other card in your hand besides "Exchange".
*   The opponent is still considered the owner of the card you take by the effect of "Exchange" for all purposes.
*   If you take your opponent’s "Kuriboh" through the effect of "Exchange" you may discard it to activate its effect (but it is discarded to your opponent’s Graveyard).

  
## EXCHANGE OF THE SPIRIT

*   “Exchange of the Spirit” does not “send” cards to the Graveyard; it swaps the cards in your Deck with those in your Graveyard. So the effects of cards like “Penguin Knight”, “Cockroach Knight”, or “Archfiend of Gilfer” will not activate, nor would the effect of “Skull Invitation” deal any damage. If “Banisher of Light” is on the field no cards will become removed from play because they are not being sent to the Graveyard.
*   “Necrovalley” will negate the effect of “Exchange of the Spirit”.
*   “Exchange of the Spirit” does not target cards in the Graveyard, so “Big Burn” cannot be activated.
*   “Exchange of the Spirit” is put into the new Graveyard after it resolves.
*   You need 15 cards in your Graveyard to activate “Exchange of the Spirit”. If you have exactly 15 and the opponent chains “Disappear” to remove from play 1 of those cards, “Exchange of the Spirit” was already activated correctly so it will resolve correctly.
*   Your opponent can have any number of cards in their Graveyard when you activate "Exchange of the Spirit", including 0.
*   If the opponent activates “Premature Burial” or “Call of the Haunted” you can chain “Exchange of the Spirit” (if you meet the requirements) to swap the cards in the Deck and the Graveyard. Since the targeted monster is no longer in their Graveyard, “Premature Burial” would be destroyed and “Call of the Haunted” would remain on the field meaninglessly.
*   Any Fusion Monsters or Synchro Monsters in the Graveyard when “Exchange of the Spirit” resolves will be returned to the Extra Deck.
*   If “Parasite Paracide” is face-up in a Deck when “Exchange of the Spirit” resolves, it will be sent to its owner’s Graveyard.

  
## EXILED FORCE

*   You cannot activate the effect of "Exiled Force" if it is the only monster on the field.

  
## EXODIA NECROSS

*   "Exodia Necross" cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, and cannot be Special Summoned EXCEPT by the effect of "Contract with Exodia". So "Exodia Necross" cannot be Special Summoned with "Monster Reborn", etc., even if Special Summoned properly first.
*   Players can activate Spell & Trap Card effects that destroy monsters, but "Exodia Necross" will not be destroyed by them.
*   If a piece of Exodia is removed from the Graveyard while "Exodia Necross" is removed from play due to "Dimensionhole", "Exodia Necross" is destroyed when it returns to the field.
*   If your opponent takes control of your "Exodia Necross" and does not have all 5 pieces of Exodia in his/her Graveyard, "Exodia Necross" is destroyed if face-up.
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, "Exodia Necross"' ATK is returned to its original 1800 points. Even if "Skill Drain" then leaves play, "Exodia Necross" does no regain any ATK increases it had because of its effect, but it will begin to accumulate ATK points again.
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, "Exodia Necross" is not destroyed if Exodia pieces are removed from the Graveyard, but it will be destroyed if the effect of "Skill Drain" disappears.

  
## EXODIA THE FORBIDDEN ONE

*   If both players have all 5 of the cards listed on "Exodia the Forbidden One" in their hand at the same time, such as if both players start with all 5 of the cards in their opening hand, or if both players draw all 5 cards by the effect of "Card Destruction", the game is declared a DRAW.

  
## EXODIUS THE ULTIMATE FORBIDDEN LORD  
> This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set. Ⓢ This card cannot be Special Summoned except by returning all monsters from your Graveyard to your Deck. ① When this card declares an attack, send 1 monster from your hand or Deck to the Graveyard. ② This card has 1000 ATK for each Normal Monster in your Graveyard. ③ When this card is removed from the field, remove it from play. Ⓒ If there are 5 different "Forbidden One" cards in your Graveyard that were sent there by this card's effect, you win the Duel.

*   The Ⓢ Summon Effect is the only way to Special Summon this card.
    *   This card CANNOT be Special Summoned from the Graveyard / removed from play area.
    *   Shuffling all monsters in your Graveyard into your Deck is a cost.
    *   This Summon does not start a chain.
*   The ① Mandatory Trigger Effect activates at the Start of the Battle Step - Attack Declaration.
    *   This effect has the same activation timing as "Mirror Force".
    *   Send 1 monster from your hand/Deck to the Graveyard when the effect resolves. This is not a cost.
    *   You still send a monster to the Graveyard (and remove it from play) while "Macro Cosmos" applies.
*   The ② Continuous Effect applies so long as this card is face-up on the field.
*   The ③ Unclassified Effect cannot be negated.
    *   If "Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord" is removed from play with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter", "Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord" is not returned to the field in the End Phase.
    *   If "Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord" is removed from the field while equipped by the effect of "Relinquished", it is removed from play.
*   The Ⓒ Condition CANNOT be negated.
    *   This alternative win condition does not start a chain.

  
## EXPLODER DRAGON  
> ① When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, destroy the monster that destroyed it. ② While this card is attacking, any Battle Damage either player takes from a battle involving this card becomes 0.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect does not target the monster that destroyed this card.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step (like "Masked Dragon").
    *   This effect will not activate if this card is removed from play instead of being sent to the Graveyard.
    *   This effect will not activate if it is destroyed by a card's effect.
*   The ② Continuous Effect only applies on your turn, while this card is attacking.

  
## EXPLODER DRAGONWING

*   "Exploder Dragonwing" has a Trigger Effect that activates at the start of Damage Step. (Before a face-down monster is flipped face-up, at the same time as "Sasuke Samurai" or "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke", etc.) You can choose whether or not to activate the effect of “Exploder Dragonwing.” However, you must activate the full effect (destroy without damage calculation + inflict effect damage) or none of it.
*   “Exploder Dragonwing” inflicts damage equal to the destroyed monster’s ATK while it was on the field, including any adjustments from continuous effects.
*   The effects of “Exploder Dragonwing” to destroy a monster and inflict damage are considered to be simultaneous, although as a practical matter the monster is destroyed first. The effect is considered to have resolved after both parts are completed.
    *   If, while the effect is being resolved, the other monster’s ATK becomes higher than that of “Exploder Dragonwing,” the effect of “Exploder Dragonwing” is not applied.

  
## EXPRESSROID

*   If one of the 2 “roid” monsters you select for “Expressroid’s” effect is removed from your Graveyard by an effect chained to this effect, the remaining “roid” monster you selected will be added to your hand.


## FACTORY OF 100 MACHINES

*   "Factory of 100 Machines" targets 1 Machine-Type monster you control.
*   Removing all "Morphtronic" monsters in your Graveyard from play is not a cost. If an effect is chained that removes the targeted Machine-Type monster from the field, you must still remove all "Morphtronic" monsters in your Graveyard from play when "Factory of 100 Machines" resolves.

  
## FAIRY BOX

*   If you have two copies of "Fairy Box" active on the field you may flip a coin twice, but only need to call 1 correctly to reduce the attacking monster’s ATK to 0.
*   The current ATK is reduced to 0, including all Equip Spell Cards. Trap Cards and Quick-Play Spell Cards cannot further increase the monster’s ATK this battle. A monster effect such as "Injection Fairy Lily" can increase its own ATK after "Fairy Box" is successful.
*   Paying 500 Life Points is optional, if you choose not to pay "Fairy Box" is destroyed.
*   The effect of "Fairy Box" does not target, so "Lord of D." will not prevent "Fairy Box" from reducing the ATK of an attacking Dragon-Type monster to 0.

  
## FAIRY GUARDIAN

*   Spell Cards that are eligible for this card’s effect include: Set Spell Cards, Equip Spell Cards, or Continuous Spell Cards destroyed by your opponent’s card effects and Spell Cards negated and destroyed by an opponent’s "Magic Jammer", "Solemn Judgment", "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8", etc. It also includes Spell Cards discarded from your hand by your opponent’s card effect, like "Delinquent Duo" or "Confiscation" and Spell Cards sent from your Deck to Graveyard by your opponent’s "Needle Worm", "Don Zaloog", "Vampire Lord", etc.
*   If you activate "Painful Choice" and a Spell Card is included in the 4 cards that are sent to the Graveyard, it cannot be targeted with the effect of "Fairy Guardian" since it was YOUR "Painful Choice" that sent the card to the Graveyard, even though your opponent decided which card you kept.

  
## FAIRY METEOR CRUSH

*   You cannot double the effect of "Fairy Meteor Crush" by equipping two copies to the same monster.
*   If you equip your "Fairy Meteor Crush" to an opponent’s monster, and it attacks a Defense Position monster on your side of the field with ATK greater than your monster’s DEF, the opponent will take the difference as Battle Damage. This is because "your opponent" is the opponent of the player who controls "Fairy Meteor Crush" not necessarily the opponent of the player who controls the monster.
*   "Kuriboh" or "Waboku" can be used to prevent the damage caused by "Fairy Meteor Crush" because it is Battle Damage.

  
## FAIRY OF THE SPRING

*   You can Set the Equip Spell Card the same turn you play "Fairy of the Spring".
*   When you add an Equip Spell Card to your hand with "Fairy of the Spring", and the same turn it is returned to the Deck with "Fiber Jar", and you draw it, you can activate it that same turn.

  
## FAIRY WIND

*   Fairy Wind does not destroy itself. Both parts of the effect are performed at the same time.
*   You can still activate “Fairy Wind” even if the only face-up Spell and Trap Cards on the field cannot be destroyed.
*   You cannot activate “Fairy Wind” unless there is at least 1 other Spell and Trap Card on the field.
*   Both players still take damage for each destroyed card even if some of the face-up Spell and Trap Cards are not destroyed. Both players take damage for all the cards destroyed, not just the ones they control.
*   If “Heavy Storm” or “Giant Trunade” is activated, you cannot activate “Fairy Wind” unless there is another face-up Spell or Trap Card other than “Heavy Storm” or “Giant Trunade.”

  
## FAKE EXPLOSION

*   If an effect is active that prevents you from Special Summoning, you can still activate “Fake Explosion” to prevent monsters from being destroyed by battle. But you cannot Special Summon in that case.
*   If you do not have “Summon Reactor ・SK” in your hand or Graveyard, you can still activate “Fake Explosion” to prevent monsters from being destroyed by battle. However, if you are unable to Special Summon “Summon Reactor ・SK” because you do not have it in your hand or Graveyard, your opponent can check your hand to confirm.
*   You can only Special Summon “Summon Reactor ・SK” if damage calculation occurs. If there is a replay, or a battle involving “Neo-Spacian Gran Mole”, or another situation in which the opponent’s monster attacked but there was no damage calculation, you cannot Special Summon “Summon Reactor ・SK”.
*   The effect of “Fake Explosion” that Special Summons after damage calculation begins a new chain.
*   You can activate “Fake Explosion” when your opponent’s monster attacks directly.

  
## FAKE FEATHER

*   Sending a “Blackwing” monster to the Graveyard is a cost to activate this effect.
*   This effect targets 1 Normal Trap Card.
*   The activation timing of the selected Normal Trap Card has to be appropriate for the time "Fake Feather" was activated.
*   If the effect of the copied Normal Trap Card targets, you have to select the target for the copied effect when "Fake Feather" resolves. In this case, “Fake Feather” targets the Normal Trap Card, as well as the target for the effect.
    *   (Example: If you activate “Fake Feather” and target “Reinforcements,” then target “Spirit Reaper,” “Fake Feather” targets both cards, so “Spirit Reaper” is destroyed.)
        *   If the selected Normal Trap Card has a cost, you do NOT have to pay that cost. You cannot activate “Fake Feather” during the Damage Step.

  
## FAKE TRAP

*   "The face-down Trap Cards protected by "Fake Trap" must be revealed when resolving the effect that would destroy them, to confirm that they are Trap Cards.
*   If your opponent activates "Heavy Storm" and your chain "Fake Trap", your Trap Cards are protected but your Spell Cards are still destroyed."

  
## FALCHIONβ

*   The effect to Special Summon from the Graveyard targets.
*   If “Falchionβ” battles a monster with the same ATK and both are destroyed, it can select and Special Summon itself from the Graveyard.
*   The effect of “Falchionβ” is mandatory.
    *   If you have no appropriate targets in your Graveyard or appropriate monsters in your Deck, your opponent can check your Deck to verify.

  
## FALLING DOWN

*   If there are no Archfiends on your side of the field, "Falling Down" is destroyed immediately, even in the middle of a chain.
*   The Archfiend you need for "Falling Down" doesn't have to be a monster. Cards like "Axe of Despair", or an Archfiend monster equipped to your "Relinquished", will prevent "Falling Down" from being destroyed.
*   You can activate "Falling Down" when there are no Archfiends on your side of the field, but it is destroyed immediately before it is equipped to a monster.
*   You cannot use "Barrel Behind the Door" against the damage from "Falling Down" because you cannot use "Barrel Behind the Door" against a Continuous or Equip Spell Card.

  
## FATAL ABACUS

*   For the effect of "Fatal Abacus" to trigger, a Monster Card that is being treated as a monster must be sent from the field to the Graveyard. This means that a Monster Card equipped to "Relinquished" or "Sword Hunter" that is sent to the Graveyard will not trigger this effect. Also, a Spell or Trap Card that is destroyed while being treated as a monster by the effect of "Magical Hats" will not trigger this effect.
*   Monster Tokens do not trigger this card’s effect because they are not sent to the Graveyard.
*   Monsters that are removed from play and monsters that are destroyed while "Banisher of the Light" is on the field do not trigger this card’s effect. This is because they never go to the Graveyard.
*   "Sent from the field to the Graveyard" includes cards that are destroyed, Tributed, or sent straight from the field to the Graveyard.
*   If multiple "Fatal Abacus" cards are active on the field, a player will take 500 points of damage for each when one of their monsters is sent from the field to the Graveyard. So if 2 are active, a player will take 1000 points of damage and if 4 are on the field (you have 3 active and your opponent has 1 active) a player will take 2000 points of damage.
*   It is the owner of the Monster Card that takes the damage, so if you control your opponent’s monster through the effect of "Change of Heart" and Tribute it, your opponent takes the 500 points of damage.

  
## FAUSTIAN BARGAIN

*   This effect targets the 1 monster you send to the Graveyard.
*   You send the monster to the Graveyard when the effect resolves.
*   You cannot activate this card unless you have a Level 4 or lower Normal Monster in your hand. If you do not have a Level 4 or lower Normal Monster in your hand when this card resolves, you still send the Special Summoned monster to the Graveyard.
*   You can activate “Faustian Bargain” while cards like “Macro Cosmos” are in play, however you cannot Special Summon the Normal Monster from your hand because you did not actually send the target Special Summoned monster to the Graveyard.

  
## FEAR FROM THE DARK

*   "Fear from the Dark" can be Normal Summoned.
*   Only the owner of "Fear from the Dark" can use its effect, because it has to be sent from your hand to your Graveyard.
*   When you discard "Fear from the Dark" with "Painful Choice", "Fear from the Dark"'s effect does not activate because it was your own card effect that caused it.
*   If "Fear from the Dark" is sent to the Graveyard during a card effect's resolution, or during a chain, activate "Fear from the Dark"'s effect after the current effect or chain has resolved.
*   If "Fear from the Dark" is sent to the Graveyard by "Last Turn"'s effect, "Fear from the Dark" is Special Summoned to the field before the attack of "Last Turn" happens.

  
## FEATHER SHOT

*   This card targets 1 face-up “Elemental Hero Avian”.
*   You can activate 2 copies of “Feather Shot” and target the same “Elemental Hero Avian”, but the second one will not increase the number of times it can attack. If you select 2 different “Elemental Hero Avians” then neither one can attack.
*   If you Summon a monster after “Feather Shot” has resolved, that monster cannot attack.
*   You cannot activate “Feather Shot” during a turn where “Absolute End” has been activated. If “Feather Shot” has already resolved, “Absolute End” cannot be activated. If “Absolute End” is chained to “Feather Shot”, then the selected “Elemental Hero Avian” cannot attack.

  
## FELGRAND DRAGON

*   If "Felgrand Dragon" is sent from the field to the Graveyard and afterwards it is removed from play (with "D.D. Crow", etc.), "Felgrand Dragon" cannot be Special Summoned with "Dimension Fusion" because "Felgrand Dragon" cannot be Special Summoned from the Removed Zone. If the “Felgrand Dragon” is returned to the Graveyard from the Removed Zone (with “Miracle Dig”, etc.), the “Felgrand Dragon” cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard because it was not sent from the field to the Graveyard.
*   The ATK gained by "Felgrand Dragon" when it is Special Summoned disappears when "Felgrand Dragon" is removed from the field or flipped face-down.
*   If "Skill Drain" is face-up on the field when "Felgrand Dragon" is Special Summoned, or if "Skill Drain" is activated after "Felgrand Dragon" is Special Summoned, "Skill Drain" will negate "Felgrand Dragon"'s ATK gaining effect. If "Skill Drain" is later negated or removed from the field, the ATK gain is not reapplied.
*   When "Felgrand Dragon" is Special Summoned, its controller selects 1 monster in his/her Graveyard as a target. If the selected monster is removed from play in chain to this effect, "Felgrand Dragon"'s effect will disappear and it will not gain ATK.
*   After "Felgrand Dragon"'s ATK gaining effect is resolved, the ATK gain will not disappear if the selected monster is removed from the Graveyard.
*   The text “This monster cannot be Special Summoned except from the Graveyard, and only if it was sent there from the field” is a condition and not an effect. It cannot be negated by “Dark Ruler Ha Des”, etc.

  
## FIBER JAR

*   When this card’s effect is activated all cards on the field, in hand, and in the Graveyards are returned to their owner’s Deck. Fusion Monsters and Synchro Monsters in any of these places are returned to the Extra Deck. Cards removed from play remain removed from play.
*   When the effect of "Fiber Jar" is activated, "Fiber Jar" itself is united with the Deck, even if it has been attacked and destroyed as a result of battle.
*   If the effect of "Fiber Jar" activates during the Battle Phase, it does not end the Battle Phase, although the turn player will have no monsters after the effect resolves.
*   If your opponent’s "Parasite Paracide" is face-up in your Deck when the effect of "Fiber Jar" is activated, it will remain there. The opponent should cut your Deck with his / her eyes closed after you shuffle to ensure fairness.
*   If "Twin-Headed Behemoth" is returned to the Deck by the effect of "Fiber Jar" and its effect has already been used once this Duel, that condition is not reset. If you again draw and Summon your "Twin-Headed Behemoth" you may not activate its effect again.

  
## FIELD BARRIER

*   You cannot activate a card with an effect like “Mystical Space Typhoon,” targeting a Field Spell Card while this card is in play.
*   If a mandatory effect is activated that would destroy a Field Spell Card while this card is in play, that Field Spell Card is not destroyed.
*   Cards or effects that would destroy all Spell Cards on the field like “Heavy Storm,” or all cards on the field, like “Demise, King of Armageddon,” can be activated while this card is in play, but the Field Spell Card will not be destroyed.
*   This card only prevents the activation of Field Spell Cards themselves. The effects of a Field Spell Card already on the field (like “Ancient City – Rainbow Ruins”) can still be activated while this card is in play.
*   While this card is active, you cannot Set a Field Spell Card if you already control a Field Spell Card.
*   If you control a Field Spell Card and “Field Barrier”, and its effect is being negated by a card like “Imperial Order,” and your opponent plays a Field Spell, then you could chain an effect to destroy “Imperial Order,” and your opponent’s Field Spell Card would be sent to the Graveyard. Your Field Spell Card will remain in play.

  
## FIEND SKULL DRAGON

*   You cannot use substitute Fusion Material Monsters such as "Beastking of the Swamps" to Fusion Summon this card. You can use the effects of "Metamorphosis", "Magical Scientist", and "Summoner of Illusions" to Special Summon this card.
*   If your opponent Flip Summons a monster with a Flip Effect, and chains a card like "Offerings to the Doomed" to destroy "Fiend Skull Dragon", the Flip Effect will not be negated since "Fiend Skull Dragon" is no longer on the field when the Flip Effect resolves, and it will only negate Flip Effect "as long as this card remains face-up on the field".
*   The opponent may activate a Trap Card that targets "Fiend Skull Dragon", but its effect will be negated and the Trap Card destroyed.
*   Cards such as "Torrential Tribute", "Bottomless Trap Hole", "Mirror Force", and "Last Turn" will all apply their effects to "Fiend Skull Dragon" because these cards do not target.
*   You can activate "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Fiend Skull Dragon". After it resolves, "Call of the Haunted" will be destroyed and "Fiend Skull Dragon" will remain on the field. Remember that "Fiend Skull Dragon" must have been properly Fusion Summoned previously in order to Special Summon it from the Graveyard.
*   You can chain "Call of the Haunted" to the activation of a Flip Effect to Special Summon "Fiend Skull Dragon", and the Flip Effect will be negated.

  
## FIENDISH CHAIN

*   This card targets 1 face-up Effect Monster.
*   You cannot target a Gemini monster being treated as a Normal Monster.

  
## FIEND'S HAND MIRROR

*   Since "Mystical Space Typhoon" cannot destroy itself, when you chain "Fiend's Hand Mirror" to your opponent's "Mystical Space Typhoon", you cannot re-direct the "Mystical Space Typhoon" to target itself. But you can re-direct it to target and destroy "Fiend's Hand Mirror".
*   When your opponent activates "Mystical Space Typhoon" to destroy his/her "Mirage of Nightmare", you can chain "Fiend's Hand Mirror" and have "Mystical Space Typhoon" destroy "Fiend's Hand Mirror" instead.

  
## FIFTH HOPE

*   If this card is sent to the Graveyard by the effect of "Destiny Hero - Diamond Dude", even if you have no cards on your side of the field and in your hand when its effect is activated during your next Main Phase, you can only draw 2 cards. The extra draw effect only applies when you activate the card "Fifth Hope" itself, not just its effect.

  
## FIGHTING SPIRIT

*   Destroying "Fighting Spirit" when the equipped monster would be destroyed does not use the Chain.
*   "Fighting Spirit" is destroyed when the equipped monster would be sent to the Graveyard by battle. If this effect is used, "Fighting Spirit" will not be on the field at the end of the Damage Step and could not be targeted by effects that activate at the end of the Damage Step.
*   If a "Hyper Hammerhead" destroyed by battle is equipped with "Fighting Spirit" and it is destroyed instead, "Hyper Hammerhead" remains on the field and its effect activates.

  
## FINAL ATTACK ORDERS

*   While "Final Attack Orders" is active, if you attack a face-down Defense Position monster, the monster is changed to Attack Position, then damage calculation is applied with the monster in Attack Position.
*   While "Final Attack Orders" is active, you can change monsters like "Guardian Sphinx" to face-down Defense Position, and while they are face-down, "Final Attack Orders" has no effect on them.
*   While "Final Attack Orders" is active, you can change the Battle Positions of monsters with "Curse of Fiend" or "Little-Winguard", but the Battle Positions are immediately changed back to Attack Position by "Final Attack Orders".
*   While "Final Attack Orders" is active, effects of "Goblin Attack Force", "Giant Orc", and "Dark Zebra" are resolved, but they are immediately changed back to Attack Position.
*   While "Final Attack Orders" and "Light of Intervention" are active, you can Special Summon a monster in face-up Defense Position, but it is immediately changed to Attack Position.
*   The effect of "Final Attack Orders" cannot be chained to.

  
## FINAL COUNTDOWN

*   You count turns for "Final Countdown" like this: Turn 1 is the turn you activate it, Turn 2 is your opponent's turn, Turn 3 is your turn after you activated "Final Countdown", etc.
*   "Final Countdown" is immediately sent to the Graveyard when it resolves.
*   You can activate "Pyro Clock of Destiny" to advance the turn count by 1 for "Final Countdown". "Final Countdown" does not have to be on the field when you use "Pyro Clock of Destiny".
*   You win when the 20th turn ends, before the Draw Phase of the 21st turn.
*   When your opponent chains "Imperial Order" to your "Final Countdown", the effect of "Final Countdown" is negated and you cannot start counting turns. But if "Final Countdown" is activated and resolves, and later "Imperial Order" is activated, it will have no effect on "Final Countdown" because "Final Countdown" will be in the Graveyard.
*   When you activate "Final Countdown", and your opponent activates "Final Countdown" during his next turn, and then uses "Pyro Clock of Destiny" to advance his "Final Countdown" by 1, both "Final Countdowns" win at the same time and the Duel is a DRAW.

  
## FINAL DESTINY

*   Discarding 5 cards from your hand is a cost. You cannot activate this card if you have less than 5 cards in your hand.

  
## FIRE ANT ASCATOR

*   Sending the Special Summoned monster to the Graveyard does not start a Chain.
*   The effect to Special Summon targets the monster you want to Special Summon.

  
## FIRE PRINCESS

*   If you have 1 "Fire Princess" and 2 "Solemn Wishes" on the field, "Fire Princess"’s effect deals 1000 damage to your opponent when you draw. If you have 1 "Fire Princess" and 2 "Marie the Fallen One" in your Graveyard, "Fire Princess"’s effect deals 1000 damage to your opponent during your Standby Phase.
*   If you have 2 "Fire Princesses" and 1 "Solemn Wishes" on the field, your opponent takes 1000 damage when you draw a card (and takes 2000 damage if you had 2 "Solemn Wishes" on the field instead of 1).
*   If "Mysterious Puppeteer" is on the field when you Summon "Fire Princess", "Fire Princess"’s effect will deal 500 damage to your opponent because of "Mysterious Puppeteer"’s effect.
*   If you have "Soul Absorption" and "Fire Princess" face-up on the field when your opponent removes 3 monsters from his Graveyard to Summon "Dark Necrofear" you will gain 1500 Life Points and "Fire Princess"’s effect will deal 500 Damage to your opponent.
*   If you have a face-up "Fire Princess" and a Set "Poison of the Old Man" when your opponent activates "Dark Hole" you may chain "Poison of the Old Man" to increase your Life Points and the effect of "Fire Princess" will deal 500 damage to your opponent even though she is then destroyed by "Dark Hole", because the effect of "Fire Princess" is a Continuous Effect.

  
## FIRE SORCERER

*   If you have fewer than 2 cards in your hand when this card is flipped face-up its Flip Effect is not activated.
*   Removing 2 cards from your hand is part of the resolution of this card’s Flip Effect, not part of the cost. So if its Flip Summon is negated by "Solemn Judgment" you do not remove any cards from your hand.

  
## FIRE TROOPER

*   "Fire Trooper"'s effect is a Trigger Effect. Sending "Fire Trooper" to the Graveyard is a cost.

  
## FIREBIRD

If the monsters were destroyed as a result of battle, the timing of this effect is at the end of the Damage Step, when the monsters are sent to the Graveyard.
*   You can chain to the activation of “Firebird”’s effect, including with “Divine Wrath”.
*   If 2 or more Winged Beast-Type monsters on the controller’s side of the field are destroyed at the same time, the ATK of “Firebird” only increases by 500 points.
*   Winged Beast-Type tokens on the controller’s side of the field are included and will increase the ATK of “Firebird” when destroyed.
*   Monsters on the controller’s side of the field that are changed to Winged Beast-Type by “DNA Surgery” are included and will increase the ATK of “Firebird” when destroyed.
*   When face-down Winged Beast-Type monsters are destroyed (by a card effect), the ATK of “Firebird” does not increase.

## FISH DEPTH CHARGE

*   "Fish Depth Charge" targets 1 card your opponent controls.
*   If "Fish Depth Charge" does not destroy the selected card when it resolves, you do not draw.

  
## FISHBORG BLASTER

*   Discarding 1 card is a cost to activate the effect.
*   The requirement that you use WATER-Attribute Synchro Material Monsters when using this monster for a Synchro Summon is a condition, not an effect. It cannot be negated by “Skill Drain.”

    *   This effect cannot be activated if you have no Level 4 or lower Warrior-Type monsters in your Deck.

    *   "Skipping a Phase" is not the same as "Conducting a Phase". Since the Battle Phase is optional, declare your intent to Conduct your Battle Phase (state you are entering the Battle Phase) in order to Skip it. Players are responsible for declaring they wish to conduct the Battle Phase.
    *   After "Frozen Soul" resolves, if your opponent doesn't Conduct their next Battle Phase: this effect lingers until a future turn where your opponent enters the Battle Phase (and is skipped) \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=888376)\].
    *   If 2(+) copies of "Frozen Soul" resolve, their lingering effects disappear all at once (like "Reckless Greed"). The effect of "Frozen Soul" does not stack with itself \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=19501802&postcount=5)\].
*   VS. "Thunder of Ruler": If "Thunder of Ruler" and "Frozen Soul" both resolve before your opponent entered the Battle Phase, then they can't conduct this first Battle Phase (due to "Thunder of Ruler"), and "Frozen Soul"'s effect lingers until a future turn when your opponent conducts the Battle Phase \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=1053373)\].
*   While "Frozen Soul" applies, you cannot activate "Last Turn" as it involves conducting a Battle Phase.
*   When you activate "Frozen Soul", and effects are chained that result in the Life Point difference being less than 2000, "Frozen Soul"'s effect still resolves.

  
## FULFILLMENT OF THE CONTRACT

*   You cannot use “Fulfillment of the Contract” to Special Summon a Ritual Monster that was discarded from the hand, or otherwise not properly Summoned.
*   You can chain to the first part of this card’s effect. However, the last part (that destroys the monster) does not start a chain.

  
## FULL SALVO

*   The cards sent to the Graveyard after the activation of “Full Salvo” are sent to the Graveyard by the effect of “Full Salvo”. They are not a cost. So they are sent when “Full Salvo” resolves, not when it is activated.
*   If you send a “Dark World” monster to the Graveyard for the effect of “Full Salvo”, its effects do not activate because it was not “discarded”.

  
## FUSHIOH RICHIE

*   "Fushioh Richie" cannot negate cards like "Bottomless Trap Hole", or "Kisetai", because they do not target.
*   When your opponent uses "Double Snare" on "Fushioh Richie", "Double Snare" is negated and destroyed.
*   You can use "Premature Burial" or "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Fushioh Richie" from your Graveyard, as long as "Fushioh Richie" was Special Summoned using the proper method ("Great Dezard") previously.
*   When "Fushioh Richie" is flipped face-up, you can Special Summon a high-level Zombie from your Graveyard (like "Vampire Lord" or "Ryu Kokki").

*   If “Fusilier Dragon, the Dual-Mode Beast”, with halved ATK and DEF because of its effect, is flipped face-down, and then flipped face-up again, it will then have its full 2800 ATK and 2000 DEF.
*   If you Summoned this card without Tribute and then “Skill Drain” is later activated, the ATK and DEF are no longer halved. If “Skill Drain” is later destroyed, the ATK and DEF remain 2800/2000.
*   If you Summon without Tribute and equip this card with "Megamorph", it's current ATK will become 2800 or 700, depending on your Life Points.

  
## FUSION DEVOURER

## FUSION RECOVERY

*   You can use “Fusion Recovery” to retrieve a Fusion Material Monster that was used with “Power Bond” or “Fusion Gate” or “Polymerization”.
*   You can use “Fusion Recovery” to retrieve a fusion substitute monster like “King of the Swamp” or “Goddess with the Third Eye” as long as it was used in a Fusion Summon.
*   “Fusion Recovery” targets 1 monster and 1 “Polymerization” in the Graveyard (so it will be negated by “Necrovalley” or “The End of Anubis”).

    *   Post July 2011 ruling: Future Fusion 'does not perform a Special Summon on activation' \[[3](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=22145287&postcount=12)\].
*   The ① effect activates when the card is played face-up on the field and creates a Lingering Effect Ⓛ.
    *   "Future Fusion" must remain on the field for its ① / Ⓛ effect(s) to resolve.
    *   This effect has no activation cost.
    *   When this effect resolves: reveal the Fusion Monster and send the Fusion Material Monsters.
    *   Fusion Materialsubstitutes (ex: "King of the Swamp") don't apply their substitution effects.
    *   If "Dimension Fissure" is active, the sent Fusion Material monsters are banished instead.
    *   Resolving this effect DOES NOT count towards the total Summons counted by "Summon Limit".
    *   The Ⓛ Lingering Effect applies during your second Standby Phase without starting a chain.
    *   The Ⓛ Lingering Effect resolves without effect if you can't Summon the Fusion Monster (whether due to "Vanity's Fiend", a full field, or because no copies remain in your Extra Deck).

## FUTURE SAMURAI

*   "Future Samurai"'s effect is an Ignition Effect. Removing from play 1 monster from your Graveyard is a cost.

  
## FUTURE VISIONS  
> ① When a monster is Normal Summoned, remove from play that monster. ② During the next Standby Phase of the controller who Summoned that monster, return it to the field in face-up Attack Position.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger-like Effect cannot miss the timing.
    *   This effect targets the Normal Summoned monster.
    *   Ignition Effect Priority does not apply when a monster is Normal Summoned, since this effect must activate in the Summon reponse timing (and Ignition Effects cannot be chained).
    *   This card must remain face-up on the field in order to activate and resolve this effect.
    *   Example 1: Player A controls Normal Summons "Necroface" while Player B's "Future Visions" is face-up. The mandatory Trigger(-like) Effects of "Future Visions" and "Necroface" activate simultaneously. Following the rules of SEGOC: Player A’s "Necroface" is Chain Link 1, and Player B’s "Future Visions" is Chain Link 2. Then, Player A activates "Book of Moon" as Chain Link 3, targeting "Necroface". When the Chain resolves, "Book of Moon" flips "Necroface" face-down, "Future Visions" banishes the Set "Necroface" (face-up), and finally "Necroface" makes both player shuffle all banished cards back into their respective Decks (including the banished "Necroface". Afterwards, a new chain is built because the other mandatory Trigger Effect of "Necroface" activates, and will cause both players to banish the top 5 cards of their Decks face-up.
    *   Example 2: Player A controls an active "Future Visions". Player A, on their turn, Normal Summons "Green Gadget" and activates its option Trigger Effect simultaneously with "Future Visions’s" mandatory Trigger-like Effect. Following the rules of SEGOC, Chain Link 1 will be "Future Visions", and Chain Link 2 will be the effect of "Green Gadget". Player B then activates "Ultimate Offering" as Chain Link 3 and declares activation of its effect by paying 500 Life Points. When resolving the chain, Player B Normal Summons "Debris Dragon" from their hand by the effect of Ultimate Offering, then "Green Gadget" adding "Red Gadget" from Player A’s Deck to their hand, and finally "Future Visions" removes "Green Gadget" from play. Since the last thing to happen was not the Normal Summon of "Debris Dragon", its optional Trigger Effect will not activate, however, "Future Visions’s" mandatory Trigger-like Effect will activate and start a new chain.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger-like Effect cannot miss the timing.
    *   This effect activates when the controller of a removed monster(s) decides to activate it.
    *   This card must remain face-up on the field in order to activate and resolve this effect.
    *   This effect does not perform a Summon. "Torrential Tribute" CANNOT be activated.
    *   The monster returns to the field. Effects that trigger when the monster is Summoned do not activate.
    *   The owner of a removed monster(s) decides which Monster Card Zone it is placed in when returned.
    *   If more than one monster is removed from play by the effect of "Future Visions", they are all returned to the field at the same time. If the player has fewer available Monster Card Zones than there are monsters that would be returned by this effect, that player chooses which monsters to return to the field and sends the remainder to the Graveyard.

  
## G.B. HUNTER

*   If “G.B. Hunter” is active and “Morphing Jar #2’s” Flip Effect is activated, it will activate but the effect will not be applied.
*   If “G.B. Hunter” is active, the first effect of “Storm Caller” cannot be used. If “G.B. Hunter” is active, the effect of “Mystic Swordsman LV6” can be used to automatically destroy a monster that it attacks. But you cannot activate the effect to return that monster to the Deck.

At the start of Substep 4 - Damage Calculation, Gaia Plate's effect applies, halving Sparkman's ATK to ## 800** (1600/2). Player A then uses "Honest", bringing Sparkman's ATK to **3600** (800+2800). After the chain, Gaia Plate's effect reapplies, reducing Sparkman's ATK to **1800 (3600/2). Damage is then calculated.

## GALLIS THE STAR BEAST  
> ① You can reveal this card in your hand to send the top card of your Deck to the Graveyard. If that card is a monster, inflict damage to your opponent equal to its Level x 200, and Special Summon this card from your hand. If it is not a monster, destroy this card.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates and resolves in the hand.
    *   If you cannot Special Summon monsters when this effect resolves, you still send the top card of your Deck to the Graveyard (and inflict damage if it was a monster). "Gallis the Star Beast" is not Special Summoned, and (if a non-monster card was sent) is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.

    *   If a Monster Card is sent: damage is inflicted AND Gallis is Special Summoned simultaneously

    *   VS. "[Imperial Iron Wall](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Imperial_Iron_Wall)": This effect cannot activate while "Imperial Iron Wall" is active. If "Imperial Iron Wall" is chained to Gandora's effect, other cards are still destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect activates during the End Phase.
    *   This effect activates regardless of who controls this card during the End Phase.
    *   If Gandora is removed from play by "[Interdimensional Matter Transporter](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Interdimensional_Matter_Transporter)" the turn it was Normal Summoned: this effect will activate after it returns to the field during the End Phase.

  
## GARLANDOLF, KING OF DESTRUCTION

*   If “Garlandolf, King of Destruction” is not face-up on the field when its effect resolves, no monsters will be destroyed.
*   All other face-up monsters with DEF less than or equal to this card’s ATK are destroyed, including your own.
*   If “Skill Drain” is later activated, “Garlandolf, King of Destruction” will lose any ATK gained from its own effect and will not regain it if “Skill Drain” is destroyed.
*   Destroying the monsters and increasing the ATK of “Garlandolf, King of Destruction” occur simultaneously.
*   If “Apocatequil” is destroyed by this effect, you can activate its effect.

  
## GAROTH, LIGHTSWORN WARRIOR  
> ① Each time a card(s) is sent from your Deck to the Graveyard by the effect of a "Lightsworn" monster you control, except "Garoth, Lightsworn Warrior", send the top 2 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard. Then, draw 1 card for each "Lightsworn" monster sent to the Graveyard by this effect.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect will activate every time its trigger is met.
    *   When this effect resolves: drawing 1 card for each "Lightsworn" monster does not start a Chain.
    *   If this effect sends "Peten the Dark Clown" to the Graveyard, its effect can activate, even if you would draw a card(s) by this effect.
    *   All cards remaining in your Deck are sent to the Graveyard if there aren't enough remaining.
*   If an effect chained to a “Lightsworn” monster’s (or “Judgment Dragon’s”) effect to send cards from your Deck to the Graveyard during the End Phase that removes that “Lightsworn” monster from the field, the “Lightsworn” monster’s effect does not resolve.

  
## GATEWAY OF THE SIX  
> ① Each time a "Six Samurai" monster is Normal or Special Summoned, place 2 Bushido Counters on this card. ② You can remove Bushido Counters from your side of the field to apply the following effects. ● 2 Counters: Until the End Phase of this turn, 1 face-up "Six Samurai" or "Shien" Effect Monster gains 500 ATK. ● 4 Counters: Add 1 "Six Samurai" monster from your Deck or Graveyard to your hand. ● 6 Counters: Special Summon 1 "Shien" Effect Monster from your Graveyard.

*   The ① Continuous Effect places Bushido Counters without using the chain.
    *   This effect applies even if the Summoned Monster is flipped face-down / leaves the field.
    *   This effect does not apply if a Monster's Summon was negated (by "Solemn Judgment").
*   The ② Ignition-like Effects start a chain. Declare which effect you are activating.
    *   Removing the corresponding number of "Bushido Counters" is a cost.
    *   "Gateway of the Six" must remain face-up on the field in order to resolve this effect.

  
## GATEWAY TO DARK WORLD

*   You cannot activate “Gateway to Dark World” if you have already Normal, Flip, or Special Summoned a monster that turn. You can Set a monster (but you cannot Special Summon a monster in face-down Defense Position).
*   This card targets 1 “Dark World” monster in your Graveyard.

  
## GATLING DRAGON

*   You must destroy as many monsters as possible based on the number of Heads you flip. If you flip 2 Heads, and the only monsters on the field are 1 of your opponent’s monsters and your “Gatling Dragon”, you must destroy both monsters. If there are only 2 monsters on the field and you flip 3 Heads, destroy both monsters.
*   You cannot activate “My Body as a Shield” as a chain to “Gatling Dragon” because it has not yet been decided if any monster(s) will be destroyed or not.

  
## GEAR GOLEM THE MOVING FORTRESS

*   You cannot activate this card's effect during your opponent's turn or during Main Phase 2.
*   You can only activate this card's effect once per turn.
*   If you activate & resolve this card's effect and then "Skill Drain" is activated, you can still attack directly because "Gear Golem the Moving Fortress"'s effect is already applied and it's still applied even if "Skill Drain" is activated.

  
## GEARFRIED THE IRON KNIGHT

*   If you Special Summon "Gearfried the Iron Knight" with "Premature Burial", it is destroyed after it is Special Summoned when its effect destroys "Premature Burial".
*   If you select your opponent's "Gearfried the Iron Knight" with "Snatch Steal", "Snatch Steal" is destroyed when it resolves and "Gearfried the Iron Knight" remains on your opponent's side of the field.

  
## GEARFRIED THE SWORDMASTER

*   If you Tribute 1 “Gearfried the Iron Knight” to activate “Release Restraint”, then chain “Serial Spell”, you can Special Summon 2 “Gearfried the Swordmaster” cards from your Deck.
*   The Equip Card must be successfully equipped to “Gearfried the Swordmaster” to activate his effect. For example, if “Mystical Space Typhoon” is chained to the activation of an Equip Card, it is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard before resolving, so the effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” does not activate.
*   If your opponent equips “Snatch Steal” to your “Gearfried the Swordmaster”, the effect of “Snatch Steal” resolves first and control changes. Then the effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” activates and your opponent gets to select which monster is destroyed.
*   The effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” activates when 1 or more Equip Card(s) are equipped to him. So even if “Collected Power” equips several Equip Cards to him simultaneously, you can only destroy 1 monster with his effect.
*   The effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to, starting a new chain after the current chain resolves. You can chain “Divine Wrath” to the activation of this effect.
*   The effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” can activate even in the Damage Step. For example, if “Brain Jacker” is attacked by “Gearfried the Swordmaster”, and “Waboku” was activated earlier in the turn, “Brain Jacker” will equip to “Gearfried the Swordmaster” and the effect will activate. In this case, the effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” will activate after the effect of “Brain Jacker” resolves, and the controller of “Brain Jacker” will select which monster to destroy.
*   This is a targeting effect that targets 1 monster.
*   The effect of “Gearfried the Swordmaster” will activate even if a Trap Card is equipped to him (such as “Metalmorph” or “Blast with Chain”).

  
## GEARTOWN  
> ① Both players can Tribute Summon "Ancient Gear" monsters with 1 less Tribute than required. ② When this card is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, you can Special Summon 1 "Ancient Gear" monster from your hand, Deck, or Graveyard.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies to both players.
    *   You can still Tribute the usual number of monsters to Summon an "Ancient Gear" monster.
    *   This effect does not apply to Tribute Setting an "Ancient Gear" monster. You cannot Set "Ancient Gear Beast" without a Tribute, but you can Normal Summon.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard, even if it leaves the Graveyard
    *   This effect does not target a monster in the Graveyard. It is not negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   This effect can activate if "Geartown" is destroyed in the hand and sent to the Graveyard.
    *   You can activate this effect if the activation (when played face-up) of "Geartown" (Chain Link 1) is negated and destroyed by "Solemn Judgment" / "Dark Bribe" (Chain Link 2).
    *   You can activate this effect if you Set a Field Spell over your (face-up/face-down) "Geartown" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=19974049&postcount=3)\].
    *   You can activate this effect if an opponent's Field Spell resolves, destroying your face-up "Geartown" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=19974049&postcount=3)\].
    *   This effect can activate if the last thing to happen when resolving an effect destroys "Geartown". If "[Ancient Fairy Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ancient_Fairy_Dragon)" destroys "Geartown" and gains 1000 Life Points, but does not add a Field Spell from Deck to hand, then "Geartown" effect can activate and does not miss the timing.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect CANNOT ACTIVATE:
    *   if "Geartown" is removed from play (by "Macro Cosmos") when destroyed.
    *   if "Geartown" was destroyed by its controller activating a new Field Spell Card \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=19974049&postcount=3)\].
    *   if "Geartown" was destroyed as Chain Link 2+.
    *   if "Geartown" was destroyed as the first part of an effect that resolves sequentially. If "[Ancient Fairy Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ancient_Fairy_Dragon)" destroys "Geartown" and gains 1000 Life Points, then also adds a Field Spell from Deck to hand, "Geartown" cannot activate its effect because it has missed the timing.

  
## GEM FLASH ENERGY

*   This card’s effect is activated during your Standby Phase, and starts a Chain.

  
## GEMINI BOOSTER

*   Both effects of this card target 1 face-up Gemini monster you control.
*   The effect to treat a Gemini monster as an Effect Monster activates even if all Gemini monsters you control are being treated as Effect Monsters.
*   The effect to treat a Gemini monster as an Effect Monster activates even if “Gemini Booster” is destroyed because the monster it was equipped to is destroyed by battle.
*   You can activate “Gemini Booster” during the Damage Step.
*   The effect to treat a Gemini monster as an Effect Monster starts a Chain.

  
## GEMINI COUNTER

*   This effect targets 1 face-up Gemini monster you control. It turns the monster face-down upon resolution.
*   If your opponent attacks your face-down Gemini monster and activates a card like “Rush Recklessly” during the Damage Step, you can Chain with “Gemini Counter.” If you do, the Spell Card will be negated and the attack target monster will be flipped face-up again immediately.

  
## GEMINI IMPS

*   The effect of “Gemini Imps” can only be activated in immediate response to your opponent’s card effect that will cause you to discard card(s) from your hand.
*   You cannot activate the effect of “Gemini Imps” in response to effects that “send” cards in your hand to the Graveyard, like “Chaos Emperor Dragon – Envoy of the End”.
*   You cannot activate the effect of “Gemini Imps” while “Banisher of the Light” is face-up on the field, because it would not be possible to send “Gemini Imps” to the Graveyard.
*   When your opponent activates the effect of “Dark Coffin” or “Helpoemer”, you can Chain “Gemini Imps” to negate the effect. However, because the “Dark Coffin” or “Helpoemer” is in the Graveyard, it cannot be destroyed so you will not draw a card for “Gemini Imps”.
*   You cannot activate the effect of “Gemini Imps” during the Damage Step. For this reason it is not possible to activate “Gemini Imps” to negate the effect of “Don Zaloog” or “Spirit Reaper” that activate when they inflict Battle Damage to a player’s Life Points.
*   “Gemini Imps” effect cannot be activated to negate “Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi’s” effect, because “Hino-Kago-Tsuchi’s” effect activates during the Damage Step when it inflicts battle damage to a player’s Life Points.
*   You cannot activate the effect of “Gemini Imps” while “Protector of the Sanctuary” is face-up on your opponent’s side of the field. If you activate the effect of “Gemini Imps” and your opponent chains “Call of the Haunted”, selecting “Protector of the Sanctuary”, “Gemini Imps” will negate the discard effect but you will not draw a card.
*   When your opponent activates “Mind Crush”, you can chain with the effect of “Gemini Imps”.
*   If you activate “Pot of Greed” and your opponent chains “Null and Void”, it is not possible to chain “Gemini Imps”.
*   If your opponent Tribute Summons “Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch”, you can chain with the effect of “Gemini Imps”. The effect of “Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch” would be negated and it would be destroyed, and then you would draw a card.

  
## GEMINI Monsters ("Gigaplant", "Elemental Hero Neos Alius", etc.)  
> This card is treated as a Normal Monster while face-up on the field or in the Graveyard. While this card is face-up on the field, you can Normal Summon it to have it be treated as an Effect Monster with this effect: \[...\].

*   Gemini Monsters are treated as Effect Monsters in the Deck, hand, when removed from play, and while their effects on the field are being negated.
*   Gemini Monsters are treated as Normal Monsters on the field and in the Graveyard.
*   The second Normal Summon ('Gemini Summon') of a Gemini Monster does not start a chain.
    *   This Summon can be negated (by "Solemn Judgment"), destroying the Gemini Monster.
    *   This Summon can be responded to with "Torrential Tribute".
    *   This Summon will trigger the effect of "Black Garden" / "Future Visions".
    *   Tributes are not required for Level 5+ Gemini Monsters.
    *   This Summon causes Continuous Effects to apply immediately.
    *   Acquired Ignition Effects can be used with Ignition Effect Priority (if the Summon was not negated).
*   Gemini Monsters that have been Normal Summoned again will lose their effects if:
    *   they are temporarily removed from the field (ex: "Junk Archer").
    *   they are flipped face-down (ex: "Book of Moon").
*   VS. "Skill Drain":
    *   Effects can be activated, and costs paid, even though they will resolve negated.
    *   You cannot perform the second Normal Summon of a Gemini Monster by its effect.
    *   A Gemini Monster can gain its effects with "Super Double Summon", but they will be negated.
    *   If a Gemini Monster gained its effects, it retains them while they are negated.
    *   If a Gemini Monster hasn't gained its effects, treat it as an Effect Monster without effects.

  
## GEMINI SPARK  
> Tribute 1 face-up Level 4 Gemini Monster you control and select 1 card on the field. Destroy the selected card and draw 1 card.

*   Tributing 1 face-up Level 4 Gemini monster you control is a cost.
*   This effect targets 1 card on the field.
*   This card cannot be activated during the Damage Step.
*   The target is destroyed and you draw 1 card simultaneously.
    *   If the target is not destroyed, then you do not draw.
    *   "Gemini Spark" cannot be activated if you have no cards in the Deck.
*   If "Gemini Spark" targets a Spell/Trap Card, and "[Fiend's Hand Mirror](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fiend%27s_Hand_Mirror)" is activated in a chain, you can change the target of "Gemini Spark" to a Monster Card.

  
## GEMINI TRAP HOLE

*   When your opponent's Gemini Monster that is being treated as an Effect Monster is destroyed by battle, you can activate "Gemini Trap Hole".
*   "Gemini Trap Hole" is activated at the end of the Damage Step when the destroyed Gemini Monster is sent to the Graveyard.

  
## GENERATION SHIFT

*   Destroying your monster for “Generation Shift” is not a cost. It’s part of the effect.
*   You can target a Limited monster with “Generation Shift”, but after destroying the monster you don’t search or shuffle your Deck.
*   You can target a Token Monster with “Generation Shift” and it will be destroyed, but you do not search or shuffle your Deck (this part of the effect is not resolved).
*   If you target “Proto-Cyber Dragon” or “Elemental Hero Neo Bubbleman” with this effect, you must add “Proto-Cyber Dragon” or “Elemental Hero Neo Bubbleman” to your hand. You cannot add “Cyber Dragon” or “Elemental Hero Bubbleman”.
*   You can target "Embodiment of Apophis" with "Generation Shift". It will be destroyed and a copy of "Embodiment of Apophis" from your Deck will be added to your hand.

  
## GENESIS DRAGON  
> ① Once per turn, you can send 1 Dragon-Type monster from your hand to the Graveyard to add 1 Dragon-Type monster from your Graveyard to your hand. ② When this card is sent from the field to the Graveyard, you can return all Dragon-Type monsters from your Graveyard to your Deck.

*   The ① Ignition Effect targets a Dragon-Type monster in the Graveyard.
    *   Discarding 1 Dragon-Type monster is a cost. You can target the discarded Dragon.
    *   You CANNOT activate this effect if you have no Dragon-Type monsters in your Graveyard.
    *   This effect will be negated by "Necrovalley".
*   The ② optional "_When... you can..._" Trigger Effect can miss the timing.
    *   This effect does not target any cards in the Graveyard. It is not negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   If activated, return all available Dragon-Type monsters (including "Genesis Dragon") to the Deck.
    *   This effect can activate even if "Genesis Dragon" is sent to the Graveyard from the hand / Deck, or while treated as an Equip Spell by "Relinquished".

  
## GENETIC WOMAN

*   Paying 1000 Life Points is a cost. This effect targets.

  
## GETSU FUHMA

*   If "Getsu Fuhma" is destroyed by damage calculation, its effect still activates as long as it battled a monster and damage calculation was performed.
*   If an attack is negated by "Magic Cylinder", etc., then "Getsu Fuhma"'s effect does not activate.
*   If "Getsu Fuhma"'s ATK is large enough to destroy "Vampire Lord" by damage calculation, then "Getsu Fuhma"'s effect doesn't activate and "Vampire Lord" won't be Special Summoned, because it was destroyed by damage calculation and not by a card effect.
*   If "Getsu Fuhma" is destroyed by "Dark Ruler Ha Des", "Getsu Fuhma"'s effect is not activated.

  
## GHOST GARDNA

*   "Ghost Gardna"'s second effect targets 1 of your opponent's monsters.
*   If a "Ghost Gardna" in your hand or Deck is destroyed and sent to your Graveyard, its effect activates.
*   If you control a face-up "Marauding Captain" and "Ghost Gardna", when your opponent attacks "Marauding Captain" you can activate "Ghost Gardna"'s effect, and the opponent's monster will attack "Ghost Gardna" instead.

  
## GHOST KNIGHT OF JACKAL

*   "Ghost Knight of Jackal"'s effect activates when you send a monster to the Graveyard.
*   If your "Ghost Knight of Jackal" attacks a face-down "Jowls of Dark Demise", your opponent takes control of "Ghost Knight of Jackal" at the time that "Jowls of Dark Demise" is sent to the Graveyard, and "Ghost Knight of Jackal"'s effect disappears.
*   If "Ghost Knight of Jackal" is removed from the field or flipped face-down before the monster it destroyed is sent to the Graveyard, then "Ghost Knight of Jackal"'s effect is not applied.
*   If "Final Attack Orders" is active, you can Special Summon a monster destroyed by "Ghost Knight of Jackal" in Defense Position, but it is changed to Attack Position immediately.
*   If your "Ghost Knight of Jackal" destroys a monster you own that is on your opponent's side of the field, the effect of "Ghost Knight of Jackal" is not applied because it only applies to "an opponent's monster" that is destroyed.
*   If "Ghost Knight of Jackal" attacks "Ghost Knight of Jackal", neither effect is applied.

  
## GIANT AXE MUMMY

*   When a monster with ATK less than "Giant Axe Mummy"’s DEF attacks "Giant Axe Mummy", the monster is treated as being destroyed by the effect of "Giant Axe Mummy", NOT "as a result of battle".

  
## GIANT KOZAKY

*   The first part of “Giant Kozaky” is a Continuous Effect that does not start a chain. The second part is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to.
*   You can chain “Barrel Behind the Door” to the Trigger Effect (the damage) of “Giant Kozaky”.
*   If “Giant Kozaky” is destroyed while face-down, then its effect that inflicts damage is not activated. If “Giant Kozaky” is face-up on the field and is targeted by “Tribute to the Doomed”, and you chain “Book of Moon” so that “Giant Kozaky” is face-down when destroyed by “Tribute to the Doomed”, there is no damage.
*   Like “Atomic Firefly”, “Foxfire”, and “Poison Draw Frog”, if a face-down “Giant Kozaky” is attacked and destroyed, its effect is not applied. However, if a face-down “Giant Kozaky” is attacked, and is not destroyed by the attack, if “Kozaky” is not face-up on the field, then “Giant Kozaky” is destroyed by its own effect after damage calculation, and damage is inflicted by its effect.
*   If “Drillroid” attacks a face-down “Giant Kozaky” while “Kozaky” is not on the field, “Giant Kozaky” is destroyed by the effect of “Drillroid” after being flipped face-up. The effect of “Giant Kozaky” is not applied and it does not inflict damage.
*   The effect of “Giant Kozaky” that inflicts damage to the controller activates in the Graveyard or the “removed zone”, wherever “Giant Kozaky” goes to after being destroyed. “The End of Anubis” will negate the effect of “Giant Kozaky” if it was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, but “Banisher of the Light” will not (because “Giant Kozaky” does not have to be “destroyed and sent to the Graveyard”). Nor will “Skill Drain” negate the damage if “Giant Kozaky” is destroyed.
*   If “Giant Kozaky” is face-up on the field with “Kozaky”, and “Kozaky” is equipped to “Relinquished”, “Giant Kozaky” is not destroyed because a card called “Kozaky” is on the field.
*   If “Giant Kozaky” is equipped to “Relinquished” as an Equip Spell Card, “Giant Kozaky” will not be destroyed by its effect because it’s not a monster (even if “Kozaky” is not on the field).
*   If “Giant Kozaky” is equipped to “Relinquished” and is destroyed by “Mystical Space Typhoon” or the effect of “Relinquished”, the effect of “Giant Kozaky” will inflict damage to the controller.

  
## GIANT RAT

*   If you attack with your "Giant Rat" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you may attack with the monster Special Summoned by "Giant Rat" before entering Main Phase 2.
*   If your opponent controls your "Giant Rat" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you get the effect of "Giant Rat" NOT your opponent.
*   Since the Special Summoning occurs during the Damage Step, "Torrential Tribute", etc. cannot be used.

  
## GIANT TRAP HOLE

*   You cannot activate “Giant Trap Hole” during the Damage Step.
*   You can activate “Giant Trap Hole” when 1 monster is Special Summoned to each side of the field, by “The Shallow Grave”, etc.

*   You can send a face-down monster to the Graveyard as the cost of “Gift of the Martyr”. Refer to the original ATK of the monster.

  
## GIGANTIC CEPHALOTUS

*   If "Skill Drain" is active, "Gigantic Cephalotus" loses any ATK gained by its effect. The ATK is not regained when "Skill Drain" is negated or removed from the field.
*   The destroyed Plant-Type monster must be a Plant-Type monster both on the field and in the Graveyard, or "Gigantic Cephalotus'" effect is not applied.

        *   They are not combined onto the same Chain.
        *   The turn player may resolve ALL their "Gladiator Beast" monsters' tag-out effects before their opponent is allowed to activate any of their own "Gladiator Beast" tag-out effects.

> ① When this card is Special Summoned by the effect of a "Gladiator Beast" monster, you can select 1 "Gladiator Beast" monster from your Graveyard and Special Summon it. Ⓛ That monster's effect(s) is negated, and it is returned to your Deck when this card is removed from the field. ② At the end of the Battle Phase, if this card attacked or was attacked, you can return it to the Deck to Special Summon 1 "Gladiator Beast" monster from your Deck, except "Gladiator Beast Darius"._

*   The ① optional "_When... you can..." Trigger Effect can miss the timing.
    *   This effect targets 1 "Gladiator Beast" monster in the Graveyard. It is negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   The target can still activate its effect.
    *   The target is continuously targeted by Darius's effect while Darius is on the field \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=847041), [REF2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=13130602&postcount=7)\].
    *   If the target battles, it can return to the Deck for no effect while Darius is face-up.
*   The target's effects are not negated:
    *   if the target is flipped face-down / leaves the field (by "Book of Moon" or "Bottomless Trap Hole").
    *   if Darius is flipped face-down / leaves the field ("Book of Moon" / "Compulsory Evacuation Device").
    *   Darius VS. "Bottomless Trap Hole": If "Bottomless Trap Hole" chains to Darius' effect (in response to Darius' Summon) the target is Special Summoned and its effects are negated \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=847041), [REF2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=13130602&postcount=7)\].
        *   This ruling conflicts with the "Book of Moon" ruling. DO NOT APPLY this ruling to other cards!
*   VS. "Skill Drain":
    *   If Darius leaves the field while "Skill Drain" applies, the target remains on the field.
    *   If the target battles, it can return to the Deck for full effect, which is not negated by Darius. This is because "Skill Drain" is negating Darius' Ⓛ effect.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect may be activated if this card was engaged in Damage Calculation.
    *   Returning the “Gladiator Beast” monster to the Deck is a cost.
    *   You can shuffle your opponent's "Gladiator Beast" (that you obtained by "Brain Control") into their deck and Special Summon a different named "Gladiator Beast" from yours.
    *   You cannot activate this effect unless there is a valid “Gladiator Beast” in Deck to Special Summon.
    *   You cannot activate this effect if your “Gladiator Beast” monster that battled was flipped face-down during the Battle Phase (even if it is flipped face-up before the end of the Battle Phase).
    *   "Royal Oppression" and “Divine Wrath” can be chained to this effect. The effect will be negated, but the “Gladiator Beast” monster will not be destroyed because it is in the Deck.
    *   If 2 or more “Gladiator Beast” battled this turn, their effects will activate and resolve separately.
        *   They are not combined onto the same Chain.
        *   The turn player may resolve ALL their "Gladiator Beast" monsters' tag-out effects before their opponent is allowed to activate any of their own "Gladiator Beast" tag-out effects.

*   If "Goggle Golem" has its ATK halved by "Shrink" and it is Normal Summoned again, its ATK will be half its new original ATK, or 1050. (This is the same whether "Shrink"'s effect was applied before or after "Goggle Golem" was Normal Summoned again.)

  
## GOKA, THE PYRE OF MALICE

*   "Goka, the Pyre of Malice"'s first effect targets 1 FIRE monster you control.
*   Tributing 1 FIRE monster is a cost to activate "Goka, the Pyre of Malice"'s third effect.
*   If you do not have an open Monster Card Zone during your Standby Phase, "Goka, the Pyre of Malice"'s second effect still activates, but its effect disappears when it resolves.

  
## GOLD SARCOPHAGUS

*   Can be activated and will resolve normally while "Thunder King Rai-Oh" isface-upon the field.
*   The selected card is placed in a face-up state when removed from play. The identity of the card is revealed when it is selected and removed from play.
*   The selected card must remain banished for the duration of the two turns in order to be added to your hand.

  
## GOLDD, WU-LORD OF DARK WORLD  
Also see rulings for “Dark World Monsters”.

*   The second part of this card’s effect targets 2 cards on the opponent’s side of the field. If the opponent chains a card to remove 1 of the 2 targets, the other targeted card is still destroyed.
*   “Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World” must be Special Summoned to resolve the second part of his effect. If you cannot Summon him because you activated “Scapegoat” that turn, or your Monster Card Zones are full, then the second part of his effect does not resolve.
*   If the Special Summon of “Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World” is negated with “Royal Oppression”, the second part of his effect does not resolve.
*   If “Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World” is discarded by your opponent’s card effect, when his effect resolves, he is Special Summoned first, and then the second part of his effect resolves. So the opponent cannot activate “Bottomless Trap Hole” or “Torrential Tribute”; the timing is no longer correct. Also, you could not draw a card for the effect of “Card of Safe Return”.
*   If monsters are targeted by “Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World”, the opponent can chain “My Body as a Shield”.
*   If at least 1 Trap Card is targeted by “Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World”, then the opponent can chain “Fake Trap” and the targeted Trap Card(s) will not be destroyed.

  
## GOLDEN BAMBOO SWORD

*   If every "Bamboo Sword" Equip Card you control is removed from field after you activate "Golden Bamboo Sword", you will still draw 2 cards.

  
## GOLDEN LADYBUG

*   "Revealing "Golden Ladybug" in your hand is a cost.
*   If your hand is being revealed by another card's effect ("Mind on Air", etc.), you cannot activate "Golden Ladybug"'s effect."

  
## GOOD GOBLIN HOUSEKEEPING

*   The number of “Good Goblin Housekeeping” cards referred to by the effect is counted at resolution of this effect. So, if you have no copies of “Good Goblin Housekeeping” in your Graveyard, and you activate “Good Goblin Housekeeping” and chain “Emergency Provisions” to send it to the Graveyard, you would draw 2 cards.
*   You can activate this card when you have no copies of “Good Goblin Housekeeping” in your Graveyard. You will draw 1 card in this case, then return 1 card from your hand to the bottom of your Deck.

  
## GORA TURTLE

*   If a face-down "Gora Turtle" is attacked by a monster with ATK higher than 1899, the attack continues and damage calculation is applied normally.
*   If "Gora Turtle" is face-up on your side of the field, and your opponent’s monster’s ATK is increased over 1899 after the declaration of the attack, the attack continues and damage calculation is applied normally.
*   If the ATK of "Gora Turtle" is higher than 1899, it cannot attack either.

  
## GORA TURTLE OF ILLUSION

*   When your opponent equips "Gora Turtle of Illusion" with an Equip Spell Card, the effect of the Equip Spell Card is negated but the card is not destroyed and remains equipped to "Gora Turtle of Illusion".
*   If "Gora Turtle of Illusion" is equipped with "Snatch Steal", both effects of "Snatch Steal" are negated. But if "Skill Drain" is activated, then "Gora Turtle of Illusion"'s effect is negated, and "Snatch Steal"'s effects will resolve properly.
*   When your opponent activates a Spell Card that targets a face-down "Gora Turtle of Illusion" as a target, and "Ceasefire" is activated as a chain, "Gora Turtle of Illusion" is flipped face-up and the Spell Card's effect is negated.

  
## GORGON'S EYE

*   "Gorgon’s Eye" cannot negate the effect of "Sangan", "Witch of the Black Forest", or "Sinister Serpent" because they activate in the Graveyard. If a Defense Position "Slate Warrior" is attacked and destroyed, the effect of "Slate Warrior" that lowers ATK and DEF is applied because it activates in the Graveyard.
*   "Gorgon’s Eye"’s effect will include monsters in Defense Position that are Summoned after "Gorgon’s Eye" resolves.
*   If a monster in Defense Position is changed to Attack Position, "Gorgon’s Eye" no longer affects the monster and the monster’s effect will be applied.
*   If "Gorgon’s Eye" is active and you activate a monster effect, and "Book of Moon" is chained to flip the monster into Defense Position, the monster’s effect is still applied and is not negated by Gorgon’s Eye because it was activated properly.
*   A Defense Position Flip Effect Monster that is attacked will have its Flip Effect negated by "Gorgon’s Eye" because it remains in Defense Position. A Defense Position Flip Effect Monster that is Flip Summoned will not have its Flip Effect negated because it is now in Attack Position.
*   If a Defense Position monster has Spell Counters, like "Skilled White Magician" or "Royal Magical Library", the Spell Counters are removed if "Gorgon’s Eye" is activated.
*   Monsters like "D.D. Warrior Lady" attacked while in Defense Position have their effects negated (because they are used before the monster is sent to the Graveyard).
*   While "Gorgon’s Eye" is active, if "Relinquished" equipped with a monster is in Defense Position, the effect of "Relinquished" is negated, it can no longer be equipped with a monster, and the Monster Card equipped to "Relinquished" is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.

  
## GORZ, THE EMISSARY OF DARKNESS  
> ① When you take damage from a card your opponent controls while you control no cards, you can Special Summon this card from your hand. ② Then activate the appropriate effect based on the type of damage:  
(2A) Battle Damage: Special Summon 1 “Emissary of Darkness Token” (Fairy-Type/ LIGHT/ Level 7/ ATK ?/DEF ?). Its ATK and DEF are each equal to the amount of battle damage you took.  
(2B) Effect Damage: Inflict damage to your opponent equal to the amount of damage you took.

*   The ① optional "_When... you can..._" Trigger Effect can miss the timing.
    *   You cannot activate Gorz's effect and chain the effect of "Tragoedia", etc.
    *   If a direct attack deals battle damage, this effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation.
    *   This effect cannot activate if battle damage was dealt while your monster battled.
    *   This effect will miss the timing if effect damage is inflict as Chain Link 2+.
    *   If "Caius the Shadow Monarch" removes from play your only card on the field, a DARK monster, and inflicts 1000 damage, this effect can be activated
    *   VS. "X-Saber Airbellum": Airbellum's mandatory Trigger Effect is always Chain Link 1, Gorz' ① optional Trigger Effect can be Chain Link 2. A second manual Chain is built in Substep 5 when Gorz' (2A) Trigger Effect activates.
*   The (2A / 2B) mandatory Trigger Effects activate and resolve on the field.
    *   The (2A) effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation. It cannot be negated by "Royal Oppression", but it can be negated by "Swallow Flip". Also, "Torrential Tribute" cannot activate.
    *   When (2A) resolves as Chain Link 1, the last thing to happen is the Special Summon of a Token.
    *   An "Emissary of Darkness Token" targeted by "Shrink" has its ATK reduced to 0 ("?" ATK / "?" DEF original stats are treated as 0 ATK / 0 DEF).

  
## GOTTOMS' EMERGENCY CALL  
> Activate only if there is a face-up "X-Saber" monster(s) on the field. Select 2 "X-Saber" monsters in either player's Graveyard(s). Special Summon those monsters to your side of the field.

*   This effect targets the 2 "X-Saber" (including "XX-Saber") monsters in the Graveyard(s).
*   If either target is not in the Graveyard when this card resolves, the other target is not Summoned \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=824459)\].
*   If your opponent controls the only face-up “X-Saber” monster on the field, you can still activate this card.
*   You can select 1 “X-Saber” monster in your Graveyard and 1 in your opponent’s Graveyard..

  
## GOYO GUARDIAN  
> 1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters._  
_① When this card destroys an opponent’s monster by battle and sends it to the Graveyard, you can Special Summon that monster to your side of the field in face-up Defense Position.

*   The Synchro Material Monsters do not need to be EARTH monsters, contrary to recent Errata.
*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates at the start of Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step (when monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the Graveyard) of the Damage Step.
    *   This effect only activates if Goyo is face-up on the field (ex: "Flamvell Firedog" and [MANY MORE](https://www.duelingbook.com/deck?id=7967783)).
    *   This effect forms a Chain with and other cards/effect that activate in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step (ex: "Michizure", "Legendary Jujitsu Master", "Mystic Tomato").
    *   VS. "Creature Swap": If Goyo destroys your monster that your opponent controlled, this effect can still Special Summon it from your Graveyard.
*   This ① optional Trigger Effect will NOT activate if:
    *   Goyo battled a monster with equal ATK and both were destroyed.
    *   Goyo is removed from the field by the effect of "D.D. Warrior Lady".
    *   Goyo is removed from the field by a Flip Effect (ex: "Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter" or "Penguin Soldier").

  
## GOZEN MATCH  
> ① Each player sends monsters they control to the Graveyard until they each control monsters of only 1 Attribute. Each player cannot control monsters with different Attributes.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies immediately after this Trap Card’s activation resolves: both players look at the face-up monsters they control and each choose 1 Attribute to keep and send their face-up monsters that aren’t that Attribute to the Graveyard.
    *   Monsters like "Dark Simorgh" can still be Summoned, they only have one Attribute while in hand.
    *   Monsters like "Dark Simorgh" whose Continuous Effects treats them as having an extra Attribute are sent to the Graveyard unless their effects are negated by "Skill Drain". This does not start a Chain.
    *   If a face-down with a different Attribute is attacked, it is flipped face-up in Substep 2 - Flip Face-Down, and is sent to the Graveyard at the start of Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation. Flip Effects will still activate, but effects that trigger when the monster is destroyed by battle will not.
*   While this effect applies, and you control a face-up monster, YOU CANNOT:
    *   Flip / Normal / Special Summoning a monster of a different Attribute.
    *   Ritual Summon a monster of a different Attribute by Tributing the face-up monster(s).
    *   Fusion/Synchro Summon a monster of a different Attribute using the face-up monster(s) as Material.
    *   Tribute your opponent's monsters to Summon "Lava Golem", unless they are all FIRE Attribute
*   While this effect applies:
    *   You can Tribute Summon a monster of any Attribute by Tributing your only face-up monster(s). Konami's reversal of this ruling was delivered months after SJC Edison \[[REF](https://web.archive.org/web/20120427230353/http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/gameplay/card_faq1.html)\].
    *   You can Set/Tribute Set/Special Summon monsters face-down of any Attribute.
    *   You can activate and resolve "Creature Swap" & "Brain Control". If an exchanged monster's Attribute differs from those already face-up on that field, it is immediately sent to the Graveyard.
    *   You can activate cards that Summon multiple monsters (if you have no face-up monsters). All of them are Summoned, then you pick one Attribute and send all others to the Graveyard.
*   VS. "Gladiator Beasts": Your Glad Beasts can tag out (return to your Deck) as long as there is another Gladiator Beast in your Deck of the correct Attribute that you COULD Summon. However, if you have no face-up monsters when the effect resolves, you can Summon a Glad Beast of any Attribute.
*   VS. "Lonefire Blossom": you cannot activate "Lonefire Blossom"'s effect unless you have a FIRE Plant-Type monster in your Deck. If you Tribute your only face-up monster (Lonefire) for this effect, you can Special Summon a non-FIRE Plant-Type monster (ex: "Dandylion", "Tytannial, Princess of Camellias").
*   VS. Uria, Lord of Searing Flames: You cannot Special Summon Uria by sending Gozen + 2 face-up Continuous Traps to the Graveyard unless you control no face-up monsters non-FIRE monsters.

  
## GRACEFUL CHARITY

*   Your opponent cannot activate "Appropriate" after you activate "Graceful Charity" since the last effect that resolves with "Graceful Charity" is discarding, not drawing, and your opponent misses the timing. But if your opponent already has an active "Appropriate" face-up on the field, he/she can draw 2 cards after you activate "Graceful Charity".
*   If "Solemn Wishes" is on the field when you activate "Graceful Charity", you gain 500 Life Points after you finish both drawing and discarding. If "Solemn Wishes" and "Skull Invitation" are on the field, you finish both drawing and discarding for the effect of "Graceful Charity" then you gain 500 Life Points, then you lose 600 Life Points.
*   If you have three pieces of Exodia in your hand, "Graceful Charity", and no other cards, and then you activate "Graceful Charity" and draw the final 2 pieces of Exodia, you must discard 2 cards before a victory can be declared, but after you discard you will no longer have all 5 pieces of Exodia, and cannot declare a victory.

  
## GRADIUS' OPTION

*   The ATK/DEF of "Gradius’ Option" is the same as the current ATK/DEF of the selected "Gradius", not the original ATK/DEF. So if you equip "Axe of Despair" to "Gradius", the ATK of "Gradius’ Option" will also increase by 1000 points.
*   Equipping "Axe of Despair" to "Gradius’ Option" has no purpose. Activating "Reinforcements" targeting "Gradius’ Option" serves no purpose. "Luminous Spark" on the field will not change the ATK/DEF of "Gradius’ Option". It always has the same ATK/DEF of the selected "Gradius".
*   If the selected "Gradius" is flipped face-down, "Gradius’ Option" is destroyed.
*   If the selected "Gradius" is temporarily removed from play by the effect of "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" or "Dimensionhole", "Gradius’ Option" is destroyed.
*   If "Gradius’ Option" is temporarily removed from play by the effect of "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" or "Dimensionhole", when it returns to the field you must select a new "Gradius". If there is no "Gradius" on the field, it is destroyed.
*   If you pick up "Gradius’ Option" by the effect of "Cyber Jar" you cannot Special Summon it, even if "Gradius" is also in the 5 cards you picked up. It is placed in your hand instead.
*   If you pick up "Gradius’ Option" by the effect of "Morphing Jar #2" you cannot Special Summon it, and it is sent to the Graveyard.
*   ”Shrink” has no effect on “Gradius’ Option”.

  
## GRAGONITH, LIGHTSWORN DRAGON  
> ① This card gains 300 ATK and DEF for each "Lightsworn" monster with a different name in your Graveyard. ② During battle between this attacking card and a Defense Position monster whose DEF is lower than the ATK of this card, inflict the difference as Battle Damage to your opponent. ③ During each of your End Phases, send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard.

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not start a chain.
    *   If "Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind" halves this card's ATK, its ATK will not change anymore.
*   The ② Continuous Effect does not start a chain.
*   The ③ mandatory Trigger Effect must resolve (even if the effect is negated) before the turn can end.
    *   If you do not have enough cards to send to the Graveyard remaining in your Deck when resolving this effect, all cards remaining in your Deck are sent to the Graveyard.
    *   If the activation of this effect is negated by "Light and Darkness Dragon", it will activate again in the same End Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
    *   If this effect is negated by "Skill Drain", it will not activate again in the same End Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
    *   The "Lightsworn" monster (or "Judgment Dragon") must remain face-up on the field in order to activate and resolve this effect.
    *   If your opponent activates "Book of Eclipse" after you resolve this effect, when "Book of Eclipse" resolves and your affected monsters are flipped face-up (and you draw 1 card for each) then each "Lightsworn" monster (or "Judgment Dragon") will once again activate this effect \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=678963)\]
*   ③ VS. "Brain Control": Player A gains control of Player B's "Lightsworn" monster until the End Phase. During the End Phase, Player A may decide in which order to activate/resolve effects:
    1.  Player A resolves "Brain Control" first, restoring control of the "Lightsworn" monster to Player B. That "Lightsworn" monster is no longer controlled by the turn player, thus its effect will not activate.
    2.  Player A activates and resolves the "Lightsworn" monster's effect to send cards from the top of their Deck to the Graveyard. Then that "Lightsworn" monster is returned to Player B's control \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=653322)\].
*   ③ VS. "Enemy Controller":
    *   During Player A's turn, Player B gains control of Player A's "Lightsworn" monster. During the End Phase, when control of the "Lightsworn" monster is restored to Player A, its mandatory Trigger Effect will activate \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/85182-judgment-dragon-and-enemy-controller/)\].

  
## GRANADORA

*   For the first effect (gaining Life Points), it is the controller of "Granadora" who gains. For the second effect (losing Life Points), it is the owner of "Granadora" who takes damage.
*   When your face-down "Granadora" is destroyed, you take 2000 damage.
*   When your "Granadora" is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, you can activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against the damage.
*   When "Granadora" is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard from the field, your hand, or from your Deck, its effect is activated.
*   When "Granadora"'s Summon is negated and it is destroyed, by "Solemn Judgment" or "Horn of Heaven", the owner of "Granadora" takes the damage.

  
## GRAND CONVERGENCE

*   Inflicting 300 damage and destroying all monsters on the field are both resolved at the same time.
*   If the 300 damage would be reduced to 0 by the effect of “Des Wombat” or “Pikeru’s Circle of Enchantment”, “Grand Convergence” can still be activated and all monsters on the field will still be destroyed.
*   If an effect that destroys “Macro Cosmos” or removes it from the field is chained to “Grand Convergence”, the effects of “Grand Convergence” will still resolve because the activation conditions were correct when it was activated.
*   “Barrel Behind the Door” can be chained to this card.
*   If there is a monster on the field, you can chain “My Body as a Shield” to this card.

  
## GRANDMASTER OF THE SIX SAMURAI  
> Ⓤ You can only control 1 "Grandmaster of the Six Samurai" monster. Ⓢ While you control a face-up "Six Samurai" monster, you can Special Summon this card from your hand. ① When this card is destroyed by your opponent's card effect, add 1 "Six Samurai" monster from your Graveyard to your hand.

*   Ⓤ is an Unclassified Effect.
    *   You CANNOTsummon a "Grandmaster of the Six Samurai" while one is already face-up under your control, however you can Tribute Set further copies.
    *   If youcontrol two or more monsters named "Grandmaster of the Six Samurai", the most recently Summoned of the monsters will be destroyed by game mechanic (your choice in the case of a tie).
    *   This Unclassified Effect CAN be negated by "Skill Drain", however you still CANNOT Summon further copies of"Grandmaster of the Six Samurai" because the UnclassifiedEffect is still active while it is in the hand or Graveyard.
*   The Ⓢ Unclassified Effect functions as a built-in Summon. This Special Summon does start a Chain.
*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect cannot misstiming.
    *   This effect targets 1 "Six Samurai" monster in your Graveyard, and can target itself.
    *   This effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard / removed from play area.
    *   This effect activates if your opponent's card effect destroys this card in your hand / field / Deck.
*   The ① Trigger Effect will NOT ACTIVATE if:
    *   your opponent uses your "Royal Oppression" to negate this card's built-in Special Summon.
    *   the Continuous Effect of your other "Six Samurai" destroyed Grandmaster as a substitute.

  
## GRANMARG THE ROCK MONARCH

*   As with most targeting effects that have specific conditions, if the targeted card is flipped face-up in a chain (for example, if it is a monster and “Ceasefire” is activated, or if it is a Trap Card and is chained to the effect of “Granmarg the Rock Monarch”), then the effect of “Granmarg the Rock Monarch” disappears.
*   The effect of “Granmarg the Rock Monarch” is an effect that targets. You select the targets when you activate the effect.

  
## GRASSCHOPPER

*   While “Grasschopper’s” effect is active, if “Grasschopper” attacks a monster and your opponent activates “Magic Cylinder” to negate the attack, “Grasschopper” can attack that same monster again.

  
## GRAVE LURE

*   If your Deck is already face-up because of “Convulsion of Nature”, then the card from “Grave Lure” is turned face-down.

  
## GRAVE OF THE SUPER ANCIENT ORGANISM  
> All face-up Level 6 or higher Special Summoned monsters on the field cannot declare an attack or activate their effects.

*   Even mandatory effects cannot activate while “Grave of the Super Ancient Organism” is active.
*   This card does not negate effects, it prevents both players from activating such effects.
*   If a monster’s Level is lowered below 6, it is no longer affected.
*   Level 6+ Monsters Special Summoned before this card resolves are affected.
*   If a monster's effect was activated, and this card was chained, that effect still resolves.

  
## GRAVE OHJA

*   If you control “Grave Ohja” and you Flip Summon a Flip Effect Monster, the two effects go on a chain. You can choose which effect is chain link 1.
*   If you control multiple copies of “Grave Ohja” and Flip Summon a monster, the effects go on a chain and you can choose the order of the chain links.
*   The second effect of “Grave Ohja” is a Trigger Effect that activates when a monster is Flip Summoned. It can be chained to.
*   If “Grave Ohja” is attacked, and you activate “Book of Moon” to flip another monster on your side of the field face-down, “Grave Ohja” has already been selected as the attack target so the attack proceeds as normal.

  
## GRAVE PROTECTOR

*   "Grave Protector"'s effect is not applied to itself when it is destroyed as a result of battle.
*   Effects like "Mystic Tomato", etc., are not activated while "Grave Protector" is face-up on the field.
*   A monster destroyed by "Dark Magician of Chaos" or "Lesser Fiend" is returned to the Deck instead of being removed from play.
*   A monster that battles with "D. D. Warrior Lady" is still removed from play even if "Grave Protector" is on the field (if "D. D. Warrior Lady"'s effect is activated).
*   If "Banisher of the Light" and "Grave Protector" are both active, destroyed monsters are removed from play.
*   When there is a face-up "Grave Protector" on the field and a face-down "Desertapir" is attacked, and "Desertapir’s" Flip Effect flips "Grave Protector" face-down, the Desertapir is sent to the Graveyard at the end of the Damage Step instead of to the Deck.
*   If "Grave Protector" is on the field, the effect of "Slate Warrior" that reduces the ATK and DEF of the monster that destroys "Slate Warrior" is still applied, even though "Slate Warrior" is shuffled back into the Deck instead of being sent to the Graveyard. The timing of "Slate Warrior’s" effect is still at the end of the Damage Step (when monsters are normally sent to the Graveyard after battle).
*   If "Grave Protector" is on the field when a monster like "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" or "Great Dezard" (with an effect based on when they destroy a monster in battle) battles and destroys a monster, then the "Great Dezard", etc., still gets the reward for destroying the monster even though the destroyed monster was shuffled into the Deck instead of being sent to the Graveyard.
*   If "Grave Protector" is on the field, a monster destroyed by "Sword Hunter" is shuffled into the Deck instead of becoming an Equip Spell Card.

  
## GRAVEKEEPER'S ASSAILANT  
> ① If "Necrovalley" is on the field when this card declares an attack, you can change the battle position of 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates in Start of the Battle Phase - Attack Declaration.
    *   This effect targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.
    *   If the target is no longer face-up, its battle position is not changed.
    *   The target can only be changed to face-up Defense Position. This effect does not Set the target.
    *   This effect can be activated even if "Necrovalley"'s effects are negated by "Magic Deflector".
    *   "Necrovalley" only needs to be face-up when this effect activates, not when it resolves.
*   VS. "Spirit Reaper": When targeted by Assailant, "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed by its own effect. Then a replay occurs, as the number of attack targets changed before entering the Damage Step. In this case, "Gravekeeper’s Assailant" can attack again, and can activate its effect again.

  
## GRAVEKEEPER'S CHIEF

*   You can use the effect of "Gravekeeper’s Chief" to Special Summon the same monster you Tributed to Summon "Gravekeeper’s Chief".
*   If you Set, Flip Summon, or Special Summon "Gravekeeper’s Chief", its Special Summoning effect is not activated.
*   If you have "Gravekeeper’s Chief" and "Necrovalley" on the field, you can use "Monster Reborn", "Premature Burial", "Call of the Haunted", etc. to revive monsters from your Graveyard. Also, if you have "Gravekeeper's Chief" on the field, your opponent can use "Monster Reborn" on monsters in your Graveyard.
*   You cannot activate "The Shallow Grave" while "Necrovalley" is active, even if you control "Gravekeeper’s Chief", because your opponent cannot Special Summon a monster from his Graveyard.
*   If "Necrovalley" is on the field, and both players control a "Gravekeeper’s Chief", then the Flip Effect of "Fiber Jar" can resolve normally, but if neither, or only 1, player has "Gravekeeper’s Chief", then the Flip Effect of "Fiber Jar" disappears.

  
## GRAVEKEEPER’S DESCENDANT  
> ① You can Tribute 1 face-up "Gravekeeper"'s monster you control, except this card, to destroy 1 card your opponent controls.

*   The ① Ignition Effect targets 1 card your opponent controls.
    *   If you gain control of the target, it is not destroyed.
    *   The target is destroyed even if it flipped face-down (by "Book of Moon") or it is chained.
*   Tributing a face-up "Gravekeeper"'s monster is a cost.
    *   If "Soul Exchange" targets your opponent's face-up "Gravekeeper"'s monster, you can Tribute it.

  
## GRAVEKEEPER'S SERVANT

*   If you have 2 of this card on the field, their effects are cumulative.
*   If your opponent has no cards left in his/her Deck, he/she cannot declare an attack while this card is on your side of the field.

  
## GRAVEKEEPER'S SPY  
> FLIP: Special Summon 1 "Gravekeeper"'s monster with 1500 or less ATK from your Deck.

*   The Flip Effect is mandatory.
    *   This effect always activates, even if there are no "Gravekeeper"'s monsters in your Deck.
    *   The "Gravekeeper"'s monster must have 1500 or less printed ATK while in the Deck.

  
## GRAVEKEEPER’S STEELE

*   This effect targets 2 “Gravekeeper’s” monsters in your Graveyard. If only 1 of the targets is still in the Graveyard when this card resolves, the remaining monster is added to your hand.

  
## GRAVEKEEPER'S VASSAL

*   The damage that is inflicted to your opponent’s Life Points as a result of battle with "Gravekeeper’s Vassal" attack is treated as effect damage instead, not Battle Damage. So your opponent cannot use "Kuriboh" or "Waboku" to prevent the damage, for example.
*   A monster destroyed by "Gravekeeper’s Vassal" in battle is still treated as "destroyed as a result of battle" (for "Mystic Tomato", "Nimble Momonga", etc.).
*   If you equip "Fairy Meteor Crush" to "Gravekeeper’s Vassal", and attack a Defense Position monster and inflict Battle Damage to the opponent’s Life Points, the damage is treated as effect damage due to "Gravekeeper’s Vassal"’s effect.
*   You cannot activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against damage inflicted by "Gravekeeper’s Vassal" because its effect is a Continuous Effect and you cannot activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against Continuous Effects.

  
## GRAVEKEEPER’S VISIONARY

*   You can Normal Summon this monster with 2 Tributes as well. “You can Normal Summon this card by Tributing 1 “Gravekeeper’s” monster” is not an effect. If a “Gravekeeper’s” monster is discarded to prevent this monster from being destroyed by battle, you perform damage calculation with the ATK of “Gravekeeper’s Visionary” without applying the extra 200 ATK.

  
## GRAVEKEEPER'S WATCHER

*   You can activate the effect of "Gravekeeper’s Watcher" to negate "Graceful Charity".
*   You cannot activate "Gravekeeper’s Watcher" during the Damage Step (such as against a "Morphing Jar" that is flipped by an attack).
*   You cannot activate "Gravekeeper’s Watcher" when a card is discarded as a cost, such as "Magic Jammer", "Kuriboh", "Tribute to the Doomed", "Thunder Dragon", or "Type Zero Magic Crusher".
*   You cannot activate "Gravekeeper’s Watcher" against your opponent's "Delinquent Duo" because it makes YOU discard, not your opponent.
*   You cannot activate "Gravekeeper's Watcher" against the activation of your opponent's "Mirage of Nightmare" because it is possible that your opponent will not have to discard (for example, by having more than 4 cards in his hand).
*   When "Morphing Jar" is Flip Summoned, you may chain the effect of "Gravekeeper's Watcher", negating the Flip Effect of "Morphing Jar" and destroying it.

  
## GRAVEROBBER

*   The selected Spell Card is added to your hand. If you do not activate the selected Spell Card, it is returned to its owner's Graveyard during the End Phase.
*   If you select an Equip Spell Card, Field Spell Card, or Continuous Spell Card and you activate it, it is not sent to the Graveyard during the End Phase.
*   If you Set the selected Spell Card and do not activate it, you do not receive damage and it is returned to its owner's Graveyard during the End Phase.

  
## GRAVITY BIND  
> ① Level 4 and higher monsters cannot attack.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect does not activate.
    *   If you activate "Gravity Bind" when a Level 4+ monster attacks, the attack stops but is not negated.
    *   If your opponent activates "Mirror Force" when your Level 4+ monster attacks, chaining "Gravity Bind" does not stop "Mirror Force" from destroying your Attack Position monsters.

  
## GRAY WING

*   Discarding 1 card is a cost.
*   You cannot discard 2 cards to gain more attacks.

  
## GREAT DEZARD

*   After destroying a second monster, "Great Dezard" still retains his first effect.
*   If your opponent uses "Double Snare" against "Great Dezard" after "Great Dezard" has achieved his first effect, "Double Snare" is negated and destroyed.
*   If "Great Dezard" is removed from the field after activating his first effect and then returns to the field, he loses his previously-achieved effect(s).
*   You can Special Summon only 1 "Fushioh Richie" by Tributing "Great Dezard".
*   "Great Dezard" can achieve his effects by destroying Monster Tokens.

  
## GREAT MAJU GARZETT

*   When you use a monster with an original ATK of "?" then "Great Maju Garzett"'s ATK is zero.

  
## GREAT SHOGUN SHIEN  
> Ⓤ If you control 2 or more "Six Samurai" monsters, you can Special Summon this card from your hand. ① Your opponent can activate only 1 Spell/Trap Card each turn. ② If this card would be destroyed, you can destroy a "Six Samurai" monster you control instead.

*   The Ⓤ Unclassified Effect works like a built-in Special Summon. This Summon does not start a chain.
*   The ① Continuous Effect applies so long as "Great Shogun Shien" is face-up on the field.
    *   Your opponent can activate either 1 Spell Card or 1 Trap Card each turn; not one of each.
    *   If the activation of your opponent’s Spell/Trap Card is negated (by “Dark Bribe"), they can still activate 1 more Spell/Trap Card after that.
    *   This effect applies during both players’ turns.
    *   The effects of face-up Spell / Trap Cards can be activated without restriction.
    *   The effects of Spell / Trap Cards in the Graveyards can be activated without restriction.
    *   If your opponent activates a Spell / Trap Card, and later you Special Summon “Great Shogun Shien” (or flip him face-up), your opponent can activate 1 more Spell / Trap Card this turn.
*   The ② Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   This effect does not target. You cannot destroy a face-down “Six Samurai” monster instead.
    *   This effect applies while resolving the effect (ex: "Call of the Haunted", "Raigeki Break").
    *   Your other “Six Samurai” monster is considered to be destroyed by this (your) effect.
        *   Example: If “Ring of Destruction” targets a “Six Samurai” monster, and you destroy a different “Six Samurai” monster instead, zero damage will be inflicted by “Ring of Destruction”.
    *   This effect can apply in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation. The substitute “Six Samurai” is sent to the Graveyard in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step, it is not treated as '_destroyed by battle_'.
    *   You cannot destroy 1 “Six Samurai” to save multiple other “Six Samurai” monsters at the same time.
        *   Example: If "Mirror Force" would destroy 2 of your "Six Samurai" monsters, you must destroy 2 Defense Position "Six Samurai" monsters to save those two.
    *   This effect cannot apply if the substitute “Six Samurai” is also being destroyed by the effect.
        *   Example: If "Mirror Force" would destroy all your "Six Samurai", you cannot substitute any.
*   If you control 2 “Six Samurai” monsters, and 1 of them equipped with “Legendary Ebon Steed” would be destroyed, the effect of “Legendary Ebon Steed” must be used. You cannot choose to destroy another “Six Samurai” monster instead.

  
## GREED

*   The effect of "Greed" only applies to cards drawn while "Greed" was active. If "Jar of Greed" is chained to "Greed"'s activation, "Jar of Greed" (Step 2) resolves and you draw 1 card for "Jar of Greed" before "Greed"’s effect (Step 1) was active, so no damage is inflicted during the End Phase. But if you chain "Greed" (Step 2) to "Pot of Greed" (Step 1), then "Greed" is active before "Pot of Greed" resolves, so the activator of "Pot of Greed" takes 1000 damage from "Greed".
*   You can chain to the effect of "Greed" that inflicts damage.

  
## GREED QUASAR

*   The Level of “Greed Quasar” increases at the same timing that monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the Graveyard.
*   This card cannot be searched from the Deck by cards like “Sangan” that search based on ATK/DEF. If “Greed Quasar” is flipped face-down, its effect is reset and any increased Levels are lost. If “Skill Drain” is activated, “Greed Quasar” loses any extra Levels it has. Even if “Skill Drain” is destroyed, the extra Levels remain lost.

  
## GREEN BABOON, DEFENDER OF THE FOREST  
> ① When a Beast-Type monster you control is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, you can pay 1000 Life Points to Special Summon this card from your hand or the Graveyard._

*   The ① optional "_When... you can..." Trigger Effect can miss the timing.
    *   This effect can be activated during either player's turn.
    *   This effect can activate even if the destroyed monster was Beast-Type by "DNA Surgery".
    *   You can only activate the effect of 1 “Green Baboon, Defender of the Forest,” even if multiple copies are available in your hand/Graveyard.
*   The ① Effect CANNOT ACTIVATE:
    *   during the Damage Step \[[REF1](https://img.yugioh-card.com/lat-am/gameplay/errata/YGOErrata100105.pdf), [REF2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=715208)\].
    *   if the destroyed Beast-Type monster was being treated as a Spell Card (by "Relinquished").
    *   if the destroyed Beast-Type monster was face-down.
    *   if the Beast-Type monster was destroyed as Chain Link 2+.
    *   if the last thing to happen when resolving an effect was not the destruction of the Beast-Type.
    *   if your only Green Baboon on the field was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard. It must be in the hand / Graveyard when your Beast-Type monster was destroyed.
    *   if your only Green Baboon and another Beast-Type are destroyed simultaneously (by "Lightning Vortex"). It must be in the hand / Graveyard when your Beast-Type was destroyed.

  
## GREEN GADGET  
> ① When you Normal Summon or Special Summon this card, you can add 1 "Red Gadget" from your Deck to your hand._

*   The ① optional "_When... you can..." Trigger Effect can miss the timing.
    *   If Normal Summoned, this effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Trap Hole").
    *   This effect can activate if Special Summoned in the Damage Step (by "Giant Rat" as Chain Link 1).
    *   This effect cannot activate if this card was Normal / Special Summoned as Chain Link 2+, such as by "Ultimate Offering" or "Call of the Haunted".

  
## GREENKAPPA

*   If there is only 1 face-down Spell or Trap Card on the field when the effect of “Greenkappa” is activated, the effect disappears.
*   You can chain to the effect of “Greenkappa”, even with the targeted Spell or Trap Cards. If only 1 of the 2 cards is chained, “Greenkappa” will still resolve and destroy the other. If “Greenkappa” is destroyed in a chain to its effect (such as with “Torrential Tribute”) its effect still resolves.
*   Since “Greenkappa” targets, you can use “Fake Trap” to save your Trap Card(s) that were targeted by “Greenkappa”.

  
## GREN MAJU DA EIZA

*   "Gren Maju Da Eiza"'s effect includes cards removed from play face-down with "Lightforce Sword" or "Different Dimension Capsule".
*   If you equip "Axe of Despair" to "Gren Maju Da Eiza", calculate its ATK and DEF according to its effect, then add +1000 ATK on top of that.
*   If "Gren Maju Da Eiza" is equipped with "Megamorph", its ATK is zero, but if "Megamorph" leaves play, recalculate its ATK using its effect.

  
## GREN, TACTICIAN OF DARK WORLD

*   This is a Trigger Effect. This effect targets.

  
## GRIGGLE

*   This card’s effect is not activated when equipped to an opponent’s "Relinquished" or "Thousand-Eyes Restrict".
*   If your opponent uses "Change of Heart" on a face-down "Griggle" and Flip Summons it, when it returns to you during the End Phase, its effect activates and your opponent will gain 3000 Life Points.

  
## GRINDER GOLEM

*   You cannot Special Summon "Grinder Golem" if you do not have 2 open Monster Zone Spaces for the "Grinder Tokens".
*   If your opponent negates the Special Summon of "Grinder Golem", the "Grinder Tokens" remain on your side of the field and you cannot Normal Summon or Set that turn.
*   If you Special Summon "Grinder Golem" while "King Tiger Wanghu" is face-up on the field, its effect activates to destroy the "Grinder Tokens" after "Grinder Golem" is Special Summoned.

  
## GROUND COLLAPSE

*   When resolving the effect of "Cyber Jar" or "Morphing Jar #2", if you pick up more monsters than you can Special Summon, due to "Ground Collapse", the monsters you cannot Special Summon are destroyed. If a "Sangan" or "Witch of the Black Forest" is destroyed this way, its effect does not activate.
*   While "Ground Collapse"'s effect is negated, monsters can be Summoned or Set into the selected Monster Card Zones. When "Ground Collapse" becomes active again, the selected Monster Card Zones cannot be used, but any monster in the selected Monster Card Zones remains there.
*   You cannot select a Monster Card Zone that is already selected by another "Ground Collapse".
*   If your opponent takes control of your monster with "Brain Control" and then activates "Ground Collapse", if there are no open Monster Card Zones for the monster to return to in the End Phase, it is destroyed.

  
## GROUND SPIDER

*   This effect does not target.
*   If "[Ground Spider](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Ground_Spider)" is no longer on the field when its effect resolves, the monster will still be switched to Defense Position.
*   If your opponent Special Summons multiple monsters and at least one of them is Summoned in Attack Position, you can activate this effect.
*   If your opponent Special Summons multiple monsters and you activate this effect, all of the Summoned monsters are changed to Defense Position.
*   You cannot activate this effect during the Damage Step.

  
## GRYPHON WING

*   You can chain "Fake Trap" to "Gryphon Wing".

  
## GRYPHON'S FEATHER DUSTER

*   "Gryphon's Feather Duster" does not destroy itself.
*   When you destroy multiple cards at the same time with "Gryphon's Feather Duster", you gain the Life Points as 1 "lump sum", so your "Fire Princess" will only do 500 damage.

  
## GUARD DOG

*   If your “Guard Dog’s” Flip Effect resolves, and then later “Cyber Jar” is flipped face-up, your opponent will not be able to Special Summon any of the monsters they pick up, and any monsters that would normally be Special Summoned will be destroyed instead.

  
## GUARD PENALTY

*   You can only draw 1 card from “Guard Penalty’s” effect. You draw 1 card the first time the selected monster is changed to Defense Position. Drawing the 1 card cannot be chained to.
*   “Guard Penalty’s” effect must resolve before the selected monster is changed to Defense Position. If the opponent chains “Enemy Controller” to change the selected monster’s position, you will not draw a card.
*   You draw 1 card even if the selected monster is changed from face-up Attack Position to face-down Defense Position. If you select “Guardian Sphinx” you could use its effect to flip itself face-down and draw 1 card.
*   If an effect changes the selected monster to Defense Position in the middle of a chain, you draw 1 card immediately after that effect resolves. You do not wait for the entire chain to resolve.

  
## GUARDIAN ANGEL JOAN

*   The controller (not the owner) of "Guardian Angel Joan" increases his/her Life Points.
*   When "Guardian Angel Joan" is destroyed while battling a monster with equal ATK (such as another "Guardian Angel Joan"), her effect is NOT activated because "Guardian Angel Joan" has been removed from the field.
*   When "Guardian Angel Joan" attacks "Cyber Jar", "Guardian Angel Joan"'s effect is not activated because she is destroyed before "Cyber Jar" is sent to the Graveyard.

  
## GUARDIAN CEAL

*   The Equip Spell Cards used for "Guardian Ceal"'s effect must be activated and equipped to "Guardian Ceal" by "Guardian Ceal"'s controller in order to be on that player's side of the field.
*   Sending 1 Equip Spell Card equipped to "Guardian Ceal" to the Graveyard is a cost.
*   When you send "Big Bang Shot" to the Graveyard for "Guardian Ceal"'s effect, your opponent can chain to this effect, and then "Guardian Ceal" is removed from play.

  
## GUARDIAN EATOS  
> Ⓤ If you have no monsters in your Graveyard, you can Special Summon this card from your hand. ① You can send 1 Equip Spell Card equipped to this card to the Graveyard to select and remove from play up to 3 monsters in your opponent's Graveyard. This card gains 500 ATK for each monster removed by this effect, until the End Phase.

*   The Ⓤ Unclassified effect works like a built-in Special Summon. This does not start a Chain.
*   The ① Ignition Effect sends an Equip Spell equipped to this card to the Graveyard for cost.
    *   You can send an opponent’s Equip Spell equipped to this card to the Graveyard as the cost.
    *   This effect targets 1, 2, or 3 monsters in your opponent’s Graveyard.
    *   Removing the targets from play and increasing this card’s ATK occur simultaneously.
    *   If a target disappears, the other targets are removed from play and Eatos gains ATK accordingly.

  
## GUARDIAN ELMA

*   When you Summon "Guardian Elma", her effect activates and you choose the Equip Spell Card you want. Your opponent can then chain to the effect and, with an effect like "Disappear", can remove the Equip Spell Card so that "Guardian Elma"'s effect disappears.
*   You cannot equip inappropriate Equip Spell Cards like "Premature Burial" or "Snatch Steal" to "Guardian Elma" with her effect.
*   You can equip a card with a cost, like "Wicked-Breaking Flamberge - Baou" to "Guardian Elma" with her effect, and you don't have to pay the cost because the Equip Spell Card is not considered "activated".
*   "Morale Boost"'s effect is applied when you equip "Guardian Elma" with a Spell Card using her effect.

  
## GUARDIAN GRARL

*   If you wish to use "Guardian Grarl"'s effect to Special Summon him from your hand, you still must have "Gravity Axe - Grarl" on your side of the field.
*   You cannot Tribute Summon "Guardian Grarl" by Tributing a monster equipped with your only "Gravity Axe - Grarl" on your side of the field, because the "Gravity Axe - Grarl" will no longer be on the field when the Summon occurs.

  
## GUARDIAN KAY'EST

*   "Guardian Kay'est" is not affected by Spell Cards, just like "The Legendary Fisherman".
*   Your opponent cannot select "Guardian Kay'est" as the target of an attack.
*   If "Guardian Kay'est" is your only monster on the field, your opponent can attack your Life Points directly.
*   As long as "Guardian Kay'est" cannot be selected as the target of an attack, it cannot be targeted by the effect of "Staunch Defender", either.
*   If "Guardian Kay'est" and another monster are targeted for "Different Dimension Gate", only the other monster is removed from play and returns when "Different Dimension Gate" is destroyed.
*   If "Guardian Kay'est" and another monster are selected for "Creature Swap"'s effect, "Creature Swap"'s effect is negated because switching is impossible.

  
## GUARDIAN TRYCE

*   If you Special Summon "Guardian Tryce", you don't get to activate his effect when he's destroyed, even if you Tribute Summoned him previously and are using "Monster Reborn" on him later.
*   You must Special Summon the exact same card that was Tributed for "Guardian Tryce" when using his effect; you cannot Special Summon a card of the same name.
*   You cannot use "Guardian Tryce"'s effect to Special Summon a "Special Summon-only" monster that had not been properly Summoned, such as a Fusion Monster that was Special Summoned with "Magical Scientist" and then Tributed for "Guardian Tryce".
*   You cannot Special Summon "Dark Ruler Ha Des" with "Guardian Tryce"'s effect.
*   You can Special Summon a monster in your opponent's Graveyard if it was used to Tribute Summon "Guardian Tryce".
*   If "Guardian Tryce" is an Equip Spell Card equipped to "Relinquished" or "Sword Hunter", and "Guardian Tryce" is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, his effect activates.
*   If "Guardian Tryce" is Set and is destroyed, his effect activates.

  
## GUARDIANS  
"Guardian Baou", "Guardian Ceal", "Guardian Elma", "Guardian Grarl", "Guardian Kay'est", and "Guardian Tryce" all share some basic rules. These rules apply to all six of these monsters. Using "Guardian Elma" as an example:

*   You can Set "Guardian Elma" face-down without "Butterfly Dagger - Elma", but you cannot Special Summon her face-down with "The Shallow Grave", etc., unless you have "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" on your side of the field.
*   If your Set "Guardian Elma" is flipped face-up with "Swords of Revealing Light", or by an attack, without "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" on your side of the field, she remains on the field because she was not Summoned.
*   "Guardian Elma" is a normally Summoned monster, not a Special Summon-only monster. So if Normal Summoned she counts as your 1 Summon for the turn.
*   You cannot use "Monster Reborn" on "Guardian Elma" if you do not have "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" on your side of the field.
*   If you activate "Monster Reborn" and target "Guardian Elma" while you have "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" on the field, and your opponent chains "Mystical Space Typhoon" to destroy "Butterfly Dagger - Elma", so that it is no longer on the field when "Monster Reborn" resolves, you cannot Special Summon "Guardian Elma" and "Monster Reborn"'s effect disappears.
*   You can Normal Summon, Flip Summon, or Special Summon "Guardian Elma" even if your "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" has its effect negated by "Imperial Order".
*   If "Cyber Jar" resolves and you pick up "Guardian Elma" without "Butterfly Dagger - Elma" on your side of the field, "Guardian Elma" is added to your hand.

  
## GUNDARI

*   The effect to return “Gundari” and the Synchro Monster activates at the start of the Damage Step.
*   If “Gundari” battles a Synchro Monster while “G.B. Hunter” is on the field, “Gundari” is returned to the hand and the Synchro Monster stays on the field.
*   If “Ally of Justice Catastor” battles “Gundari” both of their effects activate and form a Chain. If “Ally of Justice Catastor” attacks “Gundari,” both monsters are returned to the hand or Extra Deck. If “Gundari” attacks “Ally of Justice Catastor,” then “Gundari” is destroyed and “Ally of Justice Catastor” returns to the Extra Deck.

  
## GYAKU-GIRE PANDA

*   When "Gyaku-Gire Panda" is equipped with "Rod of the Mind's Eye" and attacks, the Battle Damage is 1000 points.

  
## GYROID

*   You cannot choose when to apply “Gyroid’s” effect. If “Gyroid” would be destroyed as a result of battle, its effect is applied (once per turn) whether you want it to be destroyed or not.
*   If “Gyroid” is destroyed, and is then Special Summoned again that same turn, the effect is reset and its effect will be applied again if appropriate. If “Gyroid” is attacked once, is not destroyed because of its effect, then gets flipped face-down, its effect is reset and will be applied again if attacked that turn.
*   The effect of “Gyroid” is a Continuous Effect that cannot be chained to (including “Divine Wrath”).
*   If “Gyroid” is attacked for the first time in a turn by “Dark Ruler Ha Des”, “Gyroid”’s effect is not negated because it will not be destroyed.
*   If “Gyroid” is equipped with “Heavy Mech Support Platform”, the effect of “Gyroid” will prevent both from being destroyed in battle. If attacked again the same turn and “Gyroid” would be destroyed, “Heavy Mech Support Platform” will be destroyed instead. A third attack will then destroy “Gyroid” normally.
*   If “Gyroid” is attacked during a Special Battle Phase created by the effect of “Last Turn”, and is then attacked again during the regular Battle Phase, it will be destroyed because its effect was already applied once that turn (during the Special Battle Phase).

  
## HALF OR NOTHING

*   “Half or Nothing” cannot be activated during the Damage Step. The effect of “Half or Nothing” that halves ATK only applies to monsters face-up on the field at that time. Monsters flipped face-up, or Summoned, afterwards are not affected.

  
## HALLOWED LIFE BARRIER

*   "Hallowed Life Barrier" protects your Life Points from Battle Damage and Effect Damage. It doesn’t protect your monsters from being destroyed as a result of battle.

  
## HAMMER SHOT

*   "Hammer Shot" determines which monster to destroy using current ATK, not original ATK.
*   "Hammer Shot" does not target. You determine which monster is destroyed when "Hammer Shot" resolves.

  
## HAND DESTRUCTION  
> Each player sends 2 cards from their hand to the Graveyard and draws 2 cards.

*   Sending 2 cards from the hand to the Graveyard is NOT a cost.
    *   Sending a card to the Graveyard is not the same as discarding it.
    *   Dragon-Type monsters sent to the Graveyard do not count towards "Super Rejuvenation".
    *   "Dark World" monsters will not activate, since they must be discarded to the Graveyard.
    *   If a player is unable to draw 2 cards (because they have 1 or 0 in Deck), they lose the duel.
    *   if a player does not have 2 cards in hand to send to the Graveyard, then neither player sends any cards from the hand to the Graveyard nor draws cards.
*   This card CAN be activated while "Macro Cosmos" is active. The cards are removed from play instead.
*   You CANNOT ACTIVATE "Hand Destruction":
    *   if either player has fewer than 2 cards remaining in their Deck.
    *   while "Protector of the Sanctuary" is face-up on the field.
    *   if activating (playing it face-up) it would cause you to have fewer than 2 cards in your hand.

  
## HAND OF NEPHTHYS

*   "Tribute 2 monsters on your side of the field, including this card" means that you Tribute "Hand of Nephthys" plus 1 additional monster.
*   Ignition Effects on monsters cannot be activated while the Effect Monster is face-down. So this face-down monster cannot be Tributed for its own effect.
*   You can chain to the activation of this monster’s effect.
*   Tributing monsters is a cost of this card’s effect.
*   You can Tribute a Monster Token as part of this card’s cost.
*   You can chain to the activation of "Hand of Nephthys’" effect with the effect of "Royal Oppression" to negate the Special Summon of "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys".

  
## HAND OF THE SIX SAMURAI  
> ① While you control another "Six Samurai" monster, you can Tribute 1 "Six Samurai" monster to destroy 1 monster on the field.

*   The ① Ignition Effect targets 1 monster on the field.
    *   Tributing 1 "Six Samurai" monster (including this card) you control is a cost. If "Soul Exchange" targets your opponent's "Six Samurai" monster, you can Tribute it as cost instead.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down, it is still destroyed.

  
## HANDCUFFS DRAGON

*   "Handcuffs Dragon’s" effect does not target when it is activated. However, while equipped to a monster it targets the equipped monster.
*   If "Handcuffs Dragon" becomes equipped to a monster with its effect, "Tailor of the Fickle" cannot be used to equip it to another monster.

  
## HARDENED ARMED DRAGON  
> (U1) You can send 1 Level 8 or higher monster from your hand to the Graveyard and Special Summon this card. (U2) If you Tribute this card for the Tribute Summon of a Level 7 or higher monster, that monster cannot be destroyed by card effects.

*   The (U1) Unclassified effect is a built-in Special Summon. This does not start a Chain.
    *   This can only be used to Summon this card from the hand.
    *   Sending 1 Level 8+ monster from your hand to the Graveyard is a cost.
*   The (U2) Unclassified effect does not activate. It applies to the Tribute Summoned Level 7+ monster.
    *   This effect applies even if "Skill Drain" negates the effects of the Tribute Summoned monster.
    *   If this card is Tributed to Summon "[Earthbound Immortal Aslla piscu](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Earthbound_Immortal_Aslla_piscu)" while there is not face-up Field Spell Card on the field, "[Earthbound Immortal Aslla piscu](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Earthbound_Immortal_Aslla_piscu)" will not be destroyed by its own effect.

  
## HARPIE LADY 1

*   The name of "Harpie Lady 1", "Harpie Lady 2", and "Harpie Lady 3" is treated as "Harpie Lady" for all purposes, including Deck construction. So you can have 2 copies of "Harpie Lady 1" in your Deck and 1 copy of "Harpie Lady 2", but not 2 copies of each because you would have 4 cards in your Deck treated as "Harpie Lady". This restriction also applies to your Side Deck, so if you have 3 monsters treated as "Harpie Lady" in your Deck, you cannot have any in your Side Deck.
*   The effect of "Harpie Lady 1" will increase the ATK of your opponent’s WIND monsters too.

  
## HARPIE LADY 3

*   For the effect of "Harpie Lady 3" count only your opponent’s turns. If your opponent’s monster attacks "Harpie Lady 3", then count that turn as the first of the two turns. (So the monster could not attack again that turn, even if it had the ability to attack more than once, and it could not attack on your opponent’s next turn either.) If "Harpie Lady 3" attacks your opponent’s monster, then that monster cannot attack for your opponent’s next 2 turns.
*   If "Element Magician" attacks and destroys "Harpie Lady 3" while there is another WIND monster on the field, "Element Magician" cannot attack again that turn.
*   If you control "Harpie Lady 3" and "Gemini Elf" and your opponent activates "Change of Heart" to gain control of "Gemini Elf", then attacks your "Harpie Lady 3", your "Gemini Elf" cannot attack for 2 of your opponent’s turns, even after it returns to your side of the field.

  
## HARPIE QUEEN

*   If "Skill Drain" is active on the field, while "Harpie Queen" is on the field its name will not be treated as "Harpie Lady".
*   If “Prohibition” is activated choosing “Harpie Lady”, “Harpie Queen” will not have its name treated as “Harpie Lady” and can still attack and change its battle position.

  
## HARPIES' HUNTING GROUND

*   If you control "Harpies’ Hunting Ground" on your side of the field, because it is a Field Spell Card, its effects apply to both players. When either player Normal Summons or Special Summons a "Harpie Lady" or "Harpie Lady Sisters" to the field, the controller of that newly-Summoned monster is the one who selects 1 Spell or Trap Card and destroys it.
*   You can chain to the effect of "Harpies’ Hunting Ground" that destroys 1 Spell or Trap Card.
*   The effect of "Harpies’ Hunting Ground" that increases ATK and DEF is applied to all face-up Winged Beast-Type monsters on the field, including your opponent’s, because it is a Field Spell Card.

  
## HARPIE'S PET BABY DRAGON

*   These effects accumulate, so if you have 3 “Harpie Lady” on the field all 3 effects are applied. Only face-up Harpies count, though.
*   If you activate the 3rd effect of “Harpie’s Pet Baby Dragon” and the opponent chains an effect to destroy 1 of your other “Harpie” monsters, leaving you with only 2, the effect still resolves properly because the conditions were correct when it was activated.

  
## HARPIE'S PET DRAGON

*   You count "Harpie Lady" cards on both sides of the field when increasing this card’s ATK and DEF.

  
## HATE BUSTER

*   "Hate Buster" targets the attacking monster and the Fiend-Type Monster being attacked.
*   If your Fiend-Type Monster isn't destroyed by "Hate Buster", you do not inflict damage to your opponent's Life Points.
*   "Hate Buster" inflicts damage equal to the original ATK of the destroyed monster after it is sent to the Graveyard or removed zone. If you destroy a Monster Token or a Trap Card that is treated as a monster ("Embodiment of Apophis", etc.) no damage will be inflicted.

  
## HAYABUSA KNIGHT

*   If "Hayabusa Knight"'s first attack is negated with "Magic Cylinder", it may still attack one more time.
*   If "Kuriboh"'s effect is activated during "Hayabusa Knight"'s first attack, when it attacks again "Kuriboh"'s effect is not applied.

  
## HEALING WAVE GENERATOR

*   "Healing Wave Generator"'s effect targets 1 other monster you control.
*   If an effect is chained that removes the targeted monster from the field or flips it face-down, "Healing Wave Generator"'s effect disappears.
*   If an effect is chained that shifts control of the targeted monster to your opponent, you will still gain Life Points.

  
## HEART OF CLEAR WATER

*   You may equip this card to a monster with ATK 1300 or greater, but it will be immediately destroyed.
*   If a monster equipped with this card has its ATK increased over 1299, by the effect of "Rush Recklessly", etc., this card is destroyed.
*   If your "Relinquished" or "Thousand-Eyes Restrict" is equipped with "Heart of Clear Water" and you its effect to equip it with a Monster Card whose ATK is 1300 or higher, "Heart of Clear Water" is destroyed.
*   Your monster equipped with "Heart of Clear Water" is not destroyed in battle, but you still take any Battle Damage that would be inflicted to your Life Points by the attack.
*   If you Special Summon a monster with "Premature Burial" or "Call of the Haunted" and then equip that monster with "Heart of Clear Water", the monster will not be destroyed if "Premature Burial" or "Call of the Haunted" is destroyed.
*   A monster equipped with this card can still be destroyed by effects that do not target, such as the effects of "Fissure", "Dark Hole", "Smashing Ground", or "Torrential Tribute".
*   A monster equipped with this card cannot be destroyed by a card that targets, but it may still be declared a target. So the opponent may activate "Nightmare Wheel" or "Snatch Steal" targeting your monster equipped with "Heart of Clear Water".

  
## HEART OF THE UNDERDOG

*   Missing the Timing: Suppose you have 3 copies of “Heart of the Underdog” on the field, and draw a Normal Monster Card during your Draw Phase. All 3 copies of “Heart of the Underdog” immediately activate their effects, and because they activate simultaneously, they form a chain with Chain Links 1, 2, and 3. If you draw a Normal Monster card for Chain Link 3 or Chain Link 2, your copies of “Heart of the Underdog” do not activate again. This is because they are “when… you can” optional Trigger Effects, and you “miss the timing” because you drew the Normal Monster Card during a chain and not as Chain Link 1. However, if you draw a Normal Monster Card for Chain Link 1, all 3 copies of “Heart of the Underdog” will activate their effects again.
*   “Heart of the Underdog” doesn’t only activate if you draw a Normal Monster Card for your standard draw. It will also activate its effect if you draw a Normal Monster Card with a card effect such as “Reload”, “Jar of Greed”, or “Heart of the Underdog”.
*   When you draw a Normal Monster Card, if you want to activate the effect of “Heart of the Underdog” you have to show it to your opponent immediately. You can’t do anything else in between.
*   A Normal Monster Card means a yellow card with no effect. A Ritual Monster with no effect is not a Normal Monster Card. A card like “Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon” is not a Normal Monster Card.
*   When you show a Normal Monster Card to your opponent to activate “Heart of the Underdog”, your opponent can chain “Drop Off”. You will have to discard that Normal Monster Card, but “Heart of the Underdog” still resolves its effect.
*   If you draw multiple cards at the same time during your Draw Phase, such as with “Reload”, only 1 of the cards needs to be a Normal Monster to trigger “Heart of the Underdog”, since they are all drawn at the same time. If you activate “Reload” in your Draw Phase and draw 5 Normal Monster Cards, your “Heart of the Underdog” only activates 1 time because it says “card(s)”.

  
## HEAVY MECH SUPPORT PLATFORM  
> ① Once per turn, during your Main Phase, you can equip this card to a Machine-Type monster you control as an Equip Card, OR unequip it and Special Summon it in face-up Attack Position. ② While equipped to a monster by this effect, that monster gains 500 ATK and DEF. Ⓒ (A monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the equipped monster would be destroyed, this card is destroyed instead.)

*   Note that "Heavy Mech Support Platform" is different from other Union Monsters in that its last sentence is applied if the monster it is equipped to is destroyed (period), not just when the monster is destroyed as a result of battle. This extra effect does not apply to previous Union Monsters.
*   If a monster equipped with "Heavy Mech Support Platform" is targeted by "Ring of Destruction", then "Heavy Mech Support Platform" is destroyed instead of the equipped monster, and the damage inflicted to both players by "Ring of Destruction" is 0 (because the monster targeted by "Ring of Destruction" was not destroyed by it).
*   If you have a monster, "X-Head Cannon" for example, equipped with "Heavy Mech Support Platform", and you activate "Limiter Removal", the ATK will becomes (1800 + 500) x 2 = 4600. Also, the "Heavy Mech Support Platform" will be destroyed instead of the "X-Head Cannon" during the End Phase (by the effect of "Limiter Removal") and "X-Head Cannon"'s ATK will no longer be doubled.
*   If "Heavy Mech Support Platform" is equipped to "Big Core" or "Reflect Bounder" and they would be destroyed by their effect, "Heavy Mech Support Platform" is destroyed instead.
*   If “Reflect Bounder” equipped with “Heavy Mech Support Platform” is attacked by “Dark Ruler Ha Des”, during damage calculation “Heavy Mech Support Platform” is destroyed instead of “Reflect Bounder”. Then, after damage calculation, “Reflect Bounder” will destroy itself by its own effect. Its effect is not negated, because it was not destroyed by “Dark Ruler Ha Des”.

  
## HEDGE GUARD

*   Sending “Hedge Guard” to the Graveyard is a cost. This effect does not target.

  
## HELPING ROBO FOR COMBAT

*   When "Helping Robo For Combat" destroys a monster in battle, you resolve the effect of "Helping Robo for Combat" before the destroyed monster is sent to the Graveyard.

  
## HELPOEMER

*   When you have multiple "Helpoemer" cards in your Graveyard, each with an activated effect, the effects are cumulative.
*   If your opponent chooses not to conduct a Battle Phase, there is no timing for the end of the Battle Phase, so the effect of "Helpoemer" is not activated. The same is true if the Battle Phase is skipped due to a card effect.
*   "Helpoemer" cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard even if it was not destroyed as a result of battle (the final sentence on "Helpoemer" is a condition, not an effect, and is not subject to the first sentence on "Helpoemer").

  
## HERALD OF CREATION  
> ① Once per turn, you can discard 1 card to add 1 Level 7 or higher monster from your Graveyard to your hand.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Discarding 1 card is a cost.
    *   This effect targets a Level 7(+) monster in your Graveyard. It is negated by "Necrovalley".

    *   Sending this card and 1 Fairy-Type monster from hand to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   This effect activates & resolves in the hand.
    *   By negating the activation of the previous card in the Chain, that Link is removed when the Chain resolves. The last thing to happen is this effect resolving, negating and destroying the other card.
    *   This effect cannot activate while "Macro Cosmos" is active.

  
## HERALD OF ORANGE LIGHT  
> ① You can send this card and 1 other Fairy-Type monster from your hand to the Graveyard to negate the activation of an effect of an Effect Monster your opponent controls, and destroy it. You can activate this effect during either player's turn.

*   The ① Quick Effect can activate in the Damage Step, as it negates the activation of cards/effects.
    *   Sending this card and 1 Fairy-Type monster from hand to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   This effect activates & resolves in the hand.
    *   By negating the activation of the previous card in the Chain, that Link is removed when the Chain resolves. The last thing to happen is this effect resolving, negating and destroying the other card.
    *   This effect cannot activate while "Macro Cosmos" is active.
    *   If this effect destroys a opponent's monster before the Damage Step, a replay occurs.
    *   If this effect destroys a opponent's monster during the Damage Step, no replay occurs.

  
## HERALD OF PURPLE LIGHT  
> ① You can send this card and 1 other Fairy-Type monster from your hand to the Graveyard to negate the activation of an opponent's Trap Card and destroy it. This effect can be activated during either player's turn.

*   The ① Quick Effect can activate in the Damage Step, as it negates the activation of cards/effects.

    *   This effect activates & resolves in the hand.

    *   This effect cannot activate while "Macro Cosmos" is active.

  
## HERCULEAN POWER

*   The effect to Special Summon starts a Chain. If you control a monster when this effect resolves or your opponent controls no monsters when this effect resolves, you will not Special Summon a monster.

  
## HERO BARRIER

*   You can activate this card at any time before the Damage Step. You can activate it before the opponent declares any attacks, but in that case the first attack your opponent makes will be negated.
*   “Hero Barrier” can be activated even if you do not have a face-up “Elemental Hero” monster on the field. If you do not have an “Elemental Hero” monster on the field when “Hero Barrier” resolves, then it does nothing. This means if the opponent chains “Ring of Destruction” to destroy your only “Elemental Hero”, then “Hero Barrier” does nothing.
*   If you have a face-down “Elemental Hero” monster on the field, and you activate “Hero Barrier”, when the opponent attacks your face-down monster and flips it face-up, the attack is not negated because it is already in the Damage Step.
*   If you activate “Hero Barrier” when your opponent attacks 1 of your monsters (and its not your only “Elemental Hero”), and the opponent chains “Ring of Destruction” or “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” to remove the attack-target monster from the field, a replay does not occur, because the attack is still negated by “Hero Barrier”.

  
## HERO BLAST  
> Select 1 "Elemental Hero" Normal Monster from your Graveyard and add it to your hand. Then, destroy 1 face-up monster your opponent controls with ATK equal to or less than the selected monster's ATK.

*   This effect targets 1 "Elemental Hero" Normal Monster (including Gemini Monsters) in your Graveyard.
    *   If the target is not returned to your hand, you do not destroy your opponent's monster.
*   This effect does NOT target an opponent's monster.
    *   You can activate "Hero Blast" when you opponent doesn't have any face-up monsters.
*   This effect MUST attempt to destroy an opponent's face-up monster, if its ATK is lower than the target's.
    *   "My Body as a Shield" can be activated if 1+ of your face-up monsters has less ATK than the "Elemental Hero" Normal Monster your opponent targeted with this effect.

  
## HERO COUNTERATTACK

*   You must reveal the card randomly selected by your opponent (even if it is not an "Elemental Hero" monster).
*   This card is activated at the end of the Damage Step, when monsters are sent to the Graveyard.
*   You can activate this card even if you have no "Elemental Hero" monsters in your hand.
*   You can activate this card if you your opponent controls no monsters, but if the card they select is an "Elemental Hero" monster you cannot Special Summon it because you can't destroy 1 of their monsters.
*   You cannot activate this card if you cannot Special Summon a monster due to the effect of "Scapegoat", etc.
*   If your opponent selects "Elemental Hero Neo Bubbleman", etc. that cannot be Special Summoned, you can still destroy 1 monster they control, but the selected "Elemental Hero" monster is destroyed.

  
## HERO FLASH!!

*   “HERO Flash!!” only affects “Elemental Hero” Normal Monsters that are on the field when it resolves.
*   Even if you are unable to Special Summon an “Elemental Hero” Normal Monster from your Deck, your “Elemental Hero” Normal Monsters can still attack directly.

  
## HERO HEART

*   You only halve the ATK of the selected “Elemental Hero” when “Hero Heart” resolves. If you later equip the monster with “Axe of Despair” it will get the full +1000 ATK.

  
## HERO KID

*   If “Hero Kid” is Special Summoned during the Damage Step, you can activate its effect and Special Summon 1 or 2 “Hero Kids” from your Deck.

  
## HERO MASK

*   Send 1 "Elemental Hero" monster from your Deck to the Graveyard when you resolve "Hero Mask".
*   "Hero Mask" targets 1 face-up monster you control.
*   If you select a Monster Token and send "Elemental Hero Neos" to your Graveyard, you cannot return the selected Monster Token to your Deck to Special Summon a "Neos" Fusion Monster.
*   If you select "Grandmaster of the Six Samurai" and change its name with "Hero Mask"'s effect, and afterwards you Summon another "Grandmaster of the Six Samurai", when "Hero Mask"'s effect disappears in the End Phase the Summoned "Grandmaster of the Six Samurai" is destroyed because you cannot control more than 1 face-up "Grandmaster of the Six Samurai".
*   If you select a "Harpie Lady 1" with "Hero Mask" and send "Elemental Hero Neos" to your Graveyard, the "Harpie Lady 1"'s name will be treated as "Elemental Hero Neos" and it can be returned to the Deck to Special Summon a "Neos" Fusion Monster.
*   If you select an "Elemental Hero Neos Alius" that is being treated as a Normal Monster Card and change its name to "Elemental Hero Necroshade" with "Hero Mask", if you Normal Summon the "Elemental Hero Neos Alius", so it becomes an Effect Monster, its name will be treated as "Elemental Hero Neos".

  
## HERO MEDAL

*   This card activates in the Graveyard.
*   Shuffling this card into the Deck is part of the effect, not a cost.

  
## HERO'S RULE 2

*   If an effect targets card(s) on the field and also targets card(s) in the Graveyard, you can chain "Hero's Rule 2".

  
## HIDDEN BOOK OF SPELL

*   If you have zero or 1 Spell Cards in your Graveyard, you cannot activate "Hidden Book of Spell".
*   When you activate "Hidden Book of Spell" and your opponent chains "Disappear" or "Graverobber", and 1 of the targeted Spell Cards is removed from play, the remaining Spell Card goes back to the Deck and the Deck is shuffled.

  
## HIEROGLYPH LITHOGRAPH

*   "Hieroglyph Lithograph" does not remain on the field like "Swords of Revealing Light".
*   The effect of "Hieroglyph Lithograph" cannot be negated by "Imperial Order" after "Hieroglyph Lithograph" has resolved. You can, of course, chain "Imperial Order" to the activation of "Hieroglyph Lithograph" to negate the effect.
*   When "Infinite Cards" and "Hieroglyph Lithograph" are both in effect, there is no limit to the number of cards for your hand.

  
## HIITA THE FIRE CHARMER

*   If your opponent chains “Enemy Controller” to the activation of the Flip Effect of a “Charmer”, and takes control of the “Charmer”, the Flip Effect disappears.
*   If you take control of the opponent’s monster with a “Charmer” and the opponent takes control back with “Change of Heart”, control still reverts to you after the effect of “Change of Heart” expires (even though it wasn’t your monster originally).
*   If your opponent takes control of your monster with “Snatch Steal”, and you activate the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to take it back, you keep control while the “Charmer” is face-up on the field.
*   If “Book of Moon” is chained to the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to flip the target monster face-down, the effect of the “Charmer” disappears.
*   If a “Charmer” is removed from play with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, its effect is not re-applied when it’s back on the field.
*   If “DNA Transplant” changes a monster’s Attribute so that it can be taken by a “Charmer”, and then “DNA Transplant” is destroyed so that the monster’s Attribute no longer corresponds to the effect of the “Charmer”, the controller of the “Charmer” loses control of the monster.
*   If the turn player controls a “Charmer” and a monster controlled by its effect, and activates “Assault on GHQ” and targets the controlled monster, and the opponent chains an effect to destroy the “Charmer”, the controlled monster returns to the opponent’s control, but is still destroyed by the effect of “Assault on GHQ”.

  
## HINO-KAGU-TSUCHI

*   When your "Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi" inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent, he / she discards his / her hand before drawing in their next Draw Phase. If their next Draw Phase is skipped, they discard at the start of the Standby Phase. If the Draw Phase and Standby Phase are skipped, they discard at the start of Main Phase 1.
*   The opponent cannot activate any effects at the start of their turn before they discard their hand for the effect of "Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi".

  
## HOMUNCULUS THE ALCHEMIC BEING

*   This monster’s effect is a Ignition Effect.
*   If you use this monster’s effect to change its Attribute, it remains changed as long as it remains face-up on the field, or until it is changed again.

  
## HONEST  
> ① During your Main Phase, you can return this card from the field to its owner’s hand. ② During either player’s Damage Step, when a face-up LIGHT monster you control battles, you can send this card from your hand to the Graveyard to have that monster gain ATK equal to the ATK of the opponent’s monster it is battling, until the End Phase.

*   The ① Ignition Effect can be activated during your Main Phase 1 or 2.
    *   Returning this card to the hand is not a cost.
    *   If "Honest" is flipped face-down, it is not returned to the hand.
*   The ② Quick Effect does not target your LIGHT monster.
    *   Sending "Honest" to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   The ATK gain occurs once, even if that monster (ex: "Asura Priest") battles other monsters after.
    *   This effect can activate in Substep 1 - Start of the Damage Step, Substep 3 - Before Damage Calculation, or Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.
    *   This effect activates & resolves in the hand. It cannot be negated by "Light-Imprisoning Mirror".
    *   This effect cannot be activated while "Dimensional Fissure" is active.
*   VS. "Shrink: If a monster whose ATK has been modified by "Honest" becomes targeted by "Shrink", the monster’s ATK becomes half its original ATK, and then the ATK increase from "Honest" is re-applied.

  
## HORN OF HEAVEN

*   "Horn of Heaven" cannot be used to negate a Special Summon that results from a Spell, Trap, or effect of an Effect Monster Card. You cannot use "Horn of Heaven" to negate a Special Summon from "Monster Reborn", "Polymerization", "Premature Burial", "Call of the Haunted", "Elegant Egotist", "Fusion Gate", a RItual Spell Card, "Giant Rat", "Mystic Tomato", "Marauding Captain", "Spear Cretin", "Cyber Jar", "Van'Dalgyon the Dark Dragon Lord", "Tualatin", etc.
*   "Horn of Heaven" can be used to negate the Special Summon of a monster with an inherent Special Summon effect that does not start a Chain, like "Dark Armed Dragon", "Dark Necrofear", "Cyber Dragon", "Gladiator Beast Heraklinos", "Elemental Hero Magma Neos", etc.

  
## HORN OF LIGHT

*   If a "Sangan" or a "Witch of the Black Forest" equipped with "Horn of Light" is Tributed and you activate the effect of "Horn of Light", "Horn of Light" goes on top of your Deck and then "Sangan" or "Witch of the Black Forest" is resolved. If "Sangan" is destroyed (not Tributed) the effects of "Sangan" and "Horn of Light" are simultaneous and form a chain.

  
## HORSEYTAIL

*   If "Horseytail" is declared with "Prohibition" after the "Horsetail Token" is Special Summoned, the discard effect is applied when "Horseytail Token" is destroyed.
*   If a "Horseytail Token" is Special Summoned onto your side of the field by the effect of your opponent's "Horseytail", when it is destroyed by battle with a Plant-Type monster and you send a card from your hand to the Graveyard, if you send "Elephant Statue of Disaster" to the Graveyard, its effect does not activate.
*   Sending 1 card from your hand to the Graveyard when "Horseytail Token" is destroyed by battle with a Plant-Type monster does not start a Chain.
*   If "Remove Brainwashing" or "Owner's Seal" is activated, control of the "Horseytail Token" is shifted to the player that activated the effect of "Horseytail".

  
## HORUS' SERVANT

*   "Horus’ Servant" has an effect just like "Lord of D.", but only applicable to "Horus the Black Flame Dragon". "Horus’ Servant" will not negate a card effect. All it does is prevent "Horus the Black Flame Dragon" from being selected as a target. If your opponent selects "Horus the Black Flame Dragon" as a target (with "Ring of Destruction", for example), and you chain "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Horus’ Servant", then "Horus the Black Flame Dragon" will still be destroyed by "Ring of Destruction" because "Horus’ Servant" is being Special Summoned AFTER "Horus the Black Flame Dragon" was selected. The fact that "Ring of Destruction" has not yet resolved does not matter; "Horus the Black Flame Dragon" was selected at activation of "Ring of Destruction", and "Horus’ Servant" is Special Summoned too late to prevent this.
*   Your opponent cannot activate a Spell Card, Trap Card, or Monster Effect that would select "Horus the Black Flame Dragon" as a target while "Horus’ Servant" is in play. "Horus’ Servant" does not cause the effect to be negated; he prevents the activation of the effect in the first place.

  
## HORUS THE BLACK FLAME DRAGON LV4

*   The "you" in "on your side of the field" is the current controller’s field, so as long as "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 4" is face-up, it is always "face-up on your side of the field".
*   If "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 4" destroys a monster, you can activate its effect during the End Phase, even if the destroyed monster was your monster that was controlled by your opponent.
*   If you don’t have "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6" in your hand or Deck, you cannot send "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV4" to the Graveyard to activate its effect.
*   If "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 4" destroys a monster as a result of battle, and is removed from play by "Interdimensional Matter Transporter", and returns to play during the End Phase, you can still activate its effect.
*   "If Banisher of the Light" is in play, you cannot send "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 4" to the Graveyard, so you cannot activate its effect.
*   You don’t have to send "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 4" to the Graveyard if you don’t want to, even if it destroyed a monster as a result of battle. But if you activate its effect by sending it to the Graveyard, you must Special Summon "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 6" if possible.
*   You can activate the effect of "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 4" during your opponent’s End Phase if appropriate.
*   If a level monster fulfills its condition to Special Summon the next-highest level (for example, if "Armed Dragon LV5" destroys a monster as a result of battle), and the level monster is then flipped face-down, or removed from play permanently, or sent to the Graveyard and then Special Summoned from the Graveyard, then its condition is reset and it is no longer considered to have met the condition to level up to the next level.

  
## HORUS THE BLACK FLAME DRAGON LV6

*   The "you" in "on your side of the field" is the current controller’s field, so as long as "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 6" is face-up, it is always "face-up on your side of the field".
*   If you don’t have "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8" in your hand or Deck, you cannot send "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6" to the Graveyard to activate its effect.
*   You cannot Tribute "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 6" for "Ectoplasmer"’s effect because it is not a cost, it is a Tribute when you resolve "Ectoplasmer"’s effect, and "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6" is not affected by Spell Cards’ effects.
*   If "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6" is equipped with "Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite", and would be destroyed as a result of battle, "Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite" is destroyed instead (this is not negated by "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6"’s effect).
*   If "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 6" is the only monster on the field, you can activate a Spell Card that targets, but its effect will be negated because "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 6" would be the only valid target and it is unaffected by Spell Cards.
*   You can activate "Level Up!" and send "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 6" to the Graveyard to Special Summon "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 8" because sending 1 monster to the Graveyard is a cost for "Level Up!" and if a card is unaffected by Spell Cards, that only refers to effects, not to costs.
*   If a level monster fulfills its condition to Special Summon the next-highest level (for example, if "Armed Dragon LV5" destroys a monster as a result of battle), and the level monster is then flipped face-down, or removed from play permanently, or sent to the Graveyard and then Special Summoned from the Graveyard, then its condition is reset and it is no longer considered to have met the condition to level up to the next level.

  
## HORUS THE BLACK FLAME DRAGON LV8

*   Note that "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8" has the word "except" in its Summoning conditions, which means that even if Special Summoned properly, you cannot revive it with "Monster Reborn" afterwards if it is destroyed.
*   The "you" in "on your side of the field" is the current controller’s field, so as long as "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV 8" is face-up, it is always "face-up on your side of the field".
*   The ability of "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8" to negate Spell Cards is a Quick Effect that must be chained to the activation of the Spell Card. You can activate this effect multiple times in the same chain to negate the activation and effect of several Spell Cards that are activated in the same chain.
*   You can chain the effect of "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8" to the activation of a Continuous Spell Card, Field Spell Card, or Equip Spell Card and negate it. However, if the Continuous, Field, or Equip Spell Card is already active, you cannot later decide to try and negate its effect with "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8". You can only negate it when it is originally activated.
*   You can activate the effect of "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8" during the Damage Step.

  
## HUGE REVOLUTION

*   When your opponent chains "Book of Moon" to your "Huge Revolution" and flips 1 of the 3 monsters face-down, "Huge Revolution" has already been activated correctly so the effect of "Huge Revolution" resolves.
*   When your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to your "Huge Revolution" and destroys 1 of the 3 monsters, "Huge Revolution" has already been activated correctly so the effect of "Huge Revolution" resolves.
*   "Huge Revolution" destroys both face-up and face-down cards.
*   If your opponent activates "Huge Revolution" and you have "Pandemonium Watchbear" and "Pandemonium", your "Pandemonium" card is not destroyed.

  
## HUMAN-WAVE TACTICS

*   "Human-Wave Tactics" includes Tokens.
*   If you have 2 "Human-Wave Tactics" then both effects are applied, so if 1 Level 2 or lower Normal Monster is destroyed in battle, then you Special Summon 2 monsters.
*   If your monster is destroyed as a result of battle while on your opponent's side of the field, you can't get the effect of "Human-Wave Tactics" for that monster.
*   If you don't have enough vacant Monster Card Zones to Special Summon as many monsters as you need to for "Human-Wave Tactics", Special Summon as many as you can, and the rest are destroyed. This is also true for multiple "Human-Wave Tactics", so if you have 2 "Human Wave Tactics", and each wants to Summon 2 monsters, and you only have 3 Zones, Special Summon 3 monsters and destroy 1 monster.

  
## HYDRA VIPER

*   Tributing 1 Aqua monster is a cost for declaring the attack. If you Tribute “Poison Draw Frog” for the attack, you can activate its effect.

  
## HYDRO PRESSURE CANNON

*   If this card is equipped to a monster that is unaffected by Spell Cards, this card’s effect will still be applied. The effect to send 1 random card in your opponent’s hand to the Graveyard starts a Chain.

  
## HYDROGEDDON

*   If this card battles a monster with equal ATK, and both are destroyed, you cannot Special Summon a “Hydrogeddon” from your Deck.

  
## HYENA

*   Because the effect of “Hyena” activates in the Graveyard, the owner of “Hyena” gets the effect. So if your opponent controls your “Hyena” and it is destroyed, you get the effect.
*   You can Special Summon more than 1 “Hyena” using this effect.

  
## HYPER HAMMERHEAD

*   "Hyper Hammerhead"'s effect activates at the time that a monster would be sent to the Graveyard.
*   Even if "Hyper Hammerhead" was destroyed, its effect resolves.
*   The effect of "Hyper Hammerhead" can be chained to.
*   If you have another effect that activates at the end of the Damage Step, you can place it on a chain with "Hyper Hammerhead"'s effect (such as "Hyper Hammerhead" vs. "Hyper Hammerhead").

  
## HYPER PSYCHIC BLASTER  
> ① During battle between this attacking card and a Defense Position monster whose DEF is lower than the ATK of this card, inflict the difference as Battle Damage to your opponent. ② If this card attacks a Defense Position monster whose DEF is lower than the ATK of this card, gain Life Points equal to the difference at the end of the Damage Step.

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not start a chain.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect cannot miss the timing.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step, even if this card is no longer face-up.
    *   Compute the Life Points you gain based on the attacked monster’s DEF in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step. If the attacked monster is no longer on the field, refer to its original (printed) DEF.

  
## HYPER SYNCHRON

*   If “DNA Surgery” is making all monsters on the field into Dragons, and “Hyper Synchron” is used to Synchro Summon a monster that was not originally a Dragon, the effects of “Hyper Synchron” still activate. So the Synchro Monster gains 800 ATK and is removed during the End Phase.
*   If the Synchro Monster is flipped face-down, the effects of “Hyper Synchron” are wiped, so the Synchro Monster will not gain 800 ATK or be removed from play.
*   If the End Phase is skipped, the Synchro Monster will be removed during the next End Phase. If “Imperial Iron Wall” is active, the Synchro Monster will not be removed. However, if “Imperial Iron Wall” is destroyed, the Synchro Monster will be removed during the next End Phase.
*   If the Synchro Monster is not removed from play for some reason, it still retains the +800 ATK. The +800 ATK boost and the condition to remove the Synchro Monster from play resolve as a single Trigger Effect.
*   This is not an effect that targets. Removing the Synchro Monster from play during the End Phase does not start a chain.

  
## HYSTERIC FAIRY

*   Tributing 2 monsters is a cost. "Hysteric Fairy" can be Tributed to pay its cost.

*   If “Ice Queen” is equipped to “Relinquished” while face-up and is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, you can activate the effect.

  
## IDO THE SUPREME MAGICAL FORCE

*   The effect of “Ido the Supreme Magical Force” that Summons it in the Standby Phase, and its effect that destroys all other monsters, happen simultaneously. Therefore, you can activate “Torrential Tribute” or “Bottomless Trap Hole” when it Summons itself, as you have not missed the timing.
*   If your next turn’s Standby Phase is skipped, you cannot Special Summon “Ido the Supreme Magical Force” with its effect during the following Standby Phase. The opportunity has been missed.
*   If “Ido the Supreme Magical Force” is not in the Graveyard during the next Standby Phase (if it has been removed from play, for example), it is not Special Summoned, and you do not destroy any monsters with its effect.

    *   This effect does not target a monster in the Graveyard. It is not negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   While "Zombie World" is active, you can Special Summon non-Zombie-Type monsters.
    *   If you activate the effect of "Il Blud" and an effect is chained that turns it face-down, the effect still resolves and you can Special Summon a monster.
    *   If a card is chained to this effect and destroys “Il Blud”, the effect to Special Summon is still resolved. The Special Summoned monster will not be destroyed by “Il Blud’s” effect.
    *   If there is no monster in either Graveyard or in your hand that can be Special Summoned by this effect when it resolves, your opponent can look at your hand to verify.
*   The ② Continuous Effect does not start a chain.
    *   If "Il Blud" leaves the field while resolving a Chain, destroy all Zombie-Type monsters it Special Summoned before resolving the next effect in the chain.

    *   Continuous Traps still destroy themselves if maintenance costs are not paid (ex: "Mirror Wall").
    *   Trap Monsters (ex: "Zoma the Spirit") can't be destroyed by battle or card effect.
    *   If "Heavy Storm" would destroy face-up Continous Trap Cards, "Imperial Custom" is destroyed but all other face-up Continuous Trap Cards (including your opponent's) remain.
*   Continuous Trap Cards can still:
    *   be flipped face-down (a Trap Monster targeted by "Book of Moon").
    *   be returned to the Deck (by "Raiza the Storm Monarch").
    *   be returned to the hand (by "Giant Trunade").
    *   be removed from play (by "Caius the Shadow Monarch").
    *   have their effects negated (by "Jinzo").
    *   have their activation (playing face-up) negated (by "Dark Bribe"). If the activation of a Continuous Trap Card is negated, it is sent to the Graveyard. It was never face-up on the field.

  
## IMPERIAL IRON WALL  
> ① Cards cannot be removed from play.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect does not activate.
*   Cards CANNOT activate if their cost / effect would remove a card(s) from play
    *   Examples: "Allure of Darkness", "Nobleman of Crossout", "Book of Life", "Bottomless Trap Hole").
*   If "Imperial Iron Wall" is chained, effects earlier in the Chain resolve as much as possible.
    *   Example: Player A activated "Allure of Darkness" and "Imperial Iron Wall" was chained. Player A only needs to reveal a DARK monster in hand. If they cannot, they discard their entire hand.
    *   Example: "Imperial Iron Wall" was chained to "Nobleman of Crossout", the targeted monster is destroyed but it is not removed from play. No cards in the Deck are removed from play.

*   If you chain "Imperial Order" when a Spell Card is activated, "Imperial Order" will resolve first and negate the Spell Card.
*   If you activate "Imperial Order" while Equip Spell Cards are equipped to monsters, the Equip Spell Cards remain equipped to the monsters but their effects are negated.
*   "Imperial Order" cannot be activated in the Damage Step, so you cannot activate it to negate "Rush Recklessly", etc. in the Damage Step.

## IMPRISONED QUEEN ARCHFIEND

*   Paying 1000 Life Points during your Standby Phase is a maintenance cost.

## INABA WHITE RABBIT

*   This card can only attack Life Points directly. It cannot attack another monster. If the opponent controls "Patrician of Darkness" and you attack with "Inaba White Rabbit", it is still a direct attack; they cannot select a monster as the attack target.

*   If you control "Red-Eyes B. Dragon" and activate "Inferno Fire Blast" to inflict damage, and then after that resolves you activate "Non-Spellcasting Area", "Red-Eyes B. Dragon" still cannot attack because "Non-Spellcasting Area" will not negate the condition.
*   If "Imperial Order" is chained to "Inferno Fire Blast", the effect of "Inferno Fire Blast" is negated but "Red-Eyes B. Dragon" cannot attack. However, if "Magic Jammer" negates the activation of "Inferno Fire Blast", your "Red-Eyes B. Dragon" can attack.

*   If an effect is chained that removes your Special Summoned monster from the field or flips it face-down, your opponent will still Special Summon his/her monsters. If an effect is chained that removes your opponent's only face-up monster from play or flips it face-down, your monsters are still Special Summoned.

*   If “Shrink” targets a monster that has been affected by “Inverse Universe” its ATK will be half of its original, printed ATK. After “Shrink” wears off, the monster’s ATK becomes its original, printed ATK.
*   If “Ojama Country” is switching the ATK and DEF of all monsters and “Inverse Universe” is played, the ATK and DEF values will be switched again. Even if “Ojama Country” leaves the field later, the values set by “Inverse Universe” will remain.
*   Monsters affected by “Inverse Universe” have their ATK and DEF switched for as long as they are face-up on the field.
*   You can activate “Inverse Universe” during the Damage Step, but not during damage calculation. If the ATK of a monster is being changed by an Equip Spell and “Inverse Universe” is activated, the ATK and DEF switch, but the Equip Spell does not reapply its effect to the new ATK.
*   When the Equip Spell is destroyed, the ATK and DEF of the monster do not change.
*   New Equip Spells will modify the new ATK.

  
## IRIS, THE EARTH MOTHER

*   The effect of “Iris, the Earth Mother” is a Trigger Effect. So it will start a new chain itself.

*   Sending a “Koa’ki Meiru” monster to the Graveyard is a cost to activate the second effect.
*   While “Macro Cosmos” is active, you cannot send “Iron Core of Koa’ki Meiru” to the Graveyard to pay the cost of keeping your “Koa’ki Meiru” monster on the field. So you must either pay the reveal cost, or destroy the monster.

  
## IRON CORE SPECIMEN LAB

*   Revealing “Iron Core of Koa’ki Meiru” is a maintenance cost to keep this card on the field.
*   Both players can use the effect of this card. If the opponent activates the effect of this card, the effect is considered to be controlled by the controller for this card.
    *   There is no limit to the number of times you can activate this card’s effect in a single turn.

*   A face-up "Parasite Paracide" can be selected with "Jade Insect Whistle".

*   ② VS. "Brain Control": Player A gains control of Player B's "Lightsworn" monster until the End Phase. During the End Phase, Player A may decide in which order to activate/resolve effects:
    1.  Player A resolves "Brain Control" first, restoring control of the "Lightsworn" monster to Player B. That "Lightsworn" monster is no longer controlled by the turn player, thus its effect will not activate.
    2.  Player A activates and resolves the "Lightsworn" monster's effect to send cards from the top of their Deck to the Graveyard. Then that "Lightsworn" monster is returned to Player B's control \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=653322)\].

*   You can activate "Judgment of Anubis" and select a Spell Card that negates the activation of a card and destroys it, like "My Body as a Shield" or "Bait Doll".

> ① If there is 1 or more monster(s) on the field of the controller of this card, his/her opponent cannot place a monster on the field if his/her number of monsters would exceed the number of monsters that are on the field of this card's controller.

    *   Your opponent cannot Tribute Summon if they would still control more monsters than you do.
    *   Your opponent cannot activate cards / effects that Summon (ex: "Scapegoat", "Call of the Haunted").
    *   VS. "Cyber Jar": if your opponent would control more monsters, they must destroy monsters equal to the difference; the excess monsters are never actually Summoned and instead are sent from the Deck to the Graveyard (so "Sangan" does not get its effect). So the monsters are destroyed after they are picked up, but before any monsters are Special Summoned for the effect of "Cyber Jar".
*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated. It is not an Effect.
    *   If there are already more monsters on your opponent's side of the field when you activate "Kaiser Colosseum", nothing happens to them but your opponent cannot Summon any more.

*   If “Kangaroo Champ” attacks a Flip Effect Monster, “Kangaroo Champ” is Step 1 of the chain and the Flip Effect Monster is Step 2.
*   If your opponent’s monster is destroyed during damage calculation then you cannot apply the effect of “Kangaroo Champ”.
*   The effect of “Kangaroo Champ” can be chained to. After damage calculation, it starts a new chain.

  
## KARATE MAN

*   "Revese Trap"'s effect is not applied because "doubled and halved" are not considered as increasing or decreasing.
*   If Karate Man is equipped with Megamorph, and Megamorph is halving Karate Man's ATK, and you use Karate Man's effect, Karate Man's ATK is 2000. If you use Karate Man's effect, and THEN equip him with Megamorph after that, and Megamorph would halve his ATK, then his ATK is 500.
*   If the effect of "Shrink" is applied after "Karate Man"'s effect has been used, its ATK will become 500. If "Karate Man" is affected by "Shrink", then its effect is activated, its ATK will become 2000.

    *   If “Proto-Cyber Dragon” is removed from play, copies of “Cyber Dragon” are not affected.
    *   “Harpie Lady”, “Harpie Lady 1”, “Harpie Lady 2”, “Harpie Lady 3”, or “Cyber Harpie Lady” have the same name in the Graveyard. If one is removed from play, others in the Graveyard are affected.

  
## KASHA

*   This card’s effect is a Trigger Effect. Setting the ATK equal to the number of Zombie-Type monsters x1000 is part of the resolution of the Trigger effect.
*   If you return face-down Zombie-Type monsters to the Deck they are not counted towards the ATK of “Kasha.” If you return Zombie-Type Fusion Monsters or Synchro Monsters to the Extra Deck, they count towards the ATK of “Kasha.”
*   If non-Zombie-Type monsters that are treated as Zombies by “Zombie World” are returned to the Deck by “Kasha” they do not count towards its ATK.

*   Your opponent cannot target a Dragon-Type Fusion Monster with “De-Fusion” while “King Dragun” or “Lord of D.” is on the field because “De-Fusion” targets.
*   “Divine Wrath” is NOT a card that targets, so “Divine Wrath” may be used against Dragon-Type monsters while “King Dragun” or “Lord of D.” is on the field.
*   You can chain “Divine Wrath” to the effect of “King Dragun” that Special summons a Dragon-Type monster.

  
## KING OF THE SKULL SERVANTS

*   If the number of “Skull Servant” and “King of the Skull Servants” cards in your Graveyard changes, re-calculate the original ATK of “King of the Skull Servants”. If it is equipped with "Megamorph" you would then re-apply the effect of "Megamorph".
*   If you have 2 "Skull Servant" cards in your Graveyard (original ATK 2000), and you equip this card with "Megamorph", its current ATK will become either 4000 or 1000, depending on your Life Points.

    *   This effect verifies ATK at resolution, and includes all ATK modifiers.
    *   This effect activates if a monster(s) is Summoned face-down (by "Super Nimble-Mega Hamster"), it does not destroy the Special Summoned monster because its ATK cannot be verified.

*   VS. "Return from the Different Dimension": If a monster(s) with ATK 1400 or less is Special Summoned simultaneously with Wanghu, Wanghu's effect will trigger and start another Chain. If Wanghu itself has 1400 or less ATK when resolving its effect, it is also destroyed.
*   VS. "Treeborn Frog": "Treeborn Frog" will be destroyed, but can Special Summon itself again. Doing so without purpose is considered stalling, a violation of Tournament Policy.

Ⓒ (1 monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the equipped monster is destroyed as a result of battle, destroy this card instead.)

*   While "Mask of Restrict" is active, you cannot Tribute "Kiryu" because "Mask of Restrict" prevents all Tributing, including Tributing Equip Spell Cards.
*   If you Tribute "Kiryu" while it is equipped to "Dark Blade", you cannot then use "Super Rejuvenation" and count "Kiryu" as a Dragon-Type monster.

If this card battles a LIGHT or DARK monster, any of that monster's effects that activate or apply on the field are negated during that Battle Phase, while this card remains on the field.

*   The first sentence of this card is a maintenance cost, not an effect. It does not start a Chain.
*   “Koa’ki Meiru Powerhand” only negates a monster’s effect while they are battling. This means that it only negates effects that activate on the field, or are continuous effects while on the field. Effects that activate in the Graveyard like “Sangan” are not negated.
*   If “Koa’ki Meiru Powerhand” is destroyed by battle, its effect stops working from that point.
    *   Example: if “Koa’ki Meiru Powerhand” battles “Divine Knight Ishzark,” the effect of “Koa’ki Meiru Powerhand” stops as soon as it is destroyed, and it will be removed from play by the effect of “Divine Knight Ishzark.”
*   The effect negation ability of “Koa’ki Meiru Powerhand” begins when an attack target is declared. If “Koa’ki Meiru Powerhand” declares an attack on “Cyber Valley,” and the controller of “Cyber Valley” removes it from play, “Cyber Valley” will be removed from play but the controller will not draw a card, and the Battle Phase will not end, because the effect was activated on the field and is negated by “Koa’ki Meiru Powerhand.” (Also, since the number of potential attack targets has changed in this case, a replay will occur.)

*   You cannot activate “Last Resort” if “Field Barrier” is in play, because a new Field Spell Card cannot be played.
*   You can activate “Last Resort” while you have a Field Spell Card in your Field Spell Card Zone. When “Last Resort” resolves, the Field Spell Card in your Field Spell Card Zone is destroyed and “Ancient City – Rainbow Ruins” is placed into your Field Spell Card Zone.

  
## LAST TURN

*   “Last Turn” is a very special Trap Card with very special and unusual rules. The most important thing to understand about “Last Turn” is that not all of its effects are applied when the Trap Card resolves. When “Last Turn” (the Trap Card itself) resolves, the activating player selects 1 monster on their side of the field, and all other cards on the field and in both players’ hands are sent to the Graveyard. That is all that happens when “Last Turn” resolves. After that, the turn player Special Summons 1 monster from their Deck. After that, a special Battle Phase occurs. Then, during the End Phase, the victory check of “Last Turn” is applied. “Last Turn” sets up several effects that resolve later in the turn long after the Trap Card itself has resolved. Several other cards do this too, like “Last Will” and “Change of Heart”.
*   Suppose that “Ceasefire” is activated (Chain Link 1), and “Last Turn” is chained to it (Chain Link 2). In this case, “Last Turn” resolves first, the activating player selects 1 monster on their side of the field, and all other cards are sent to the Graveyard. Then resolve the effect of “Ceasefire” (Chain Link 1). After “Ceasefire” resolves, the turn player Special Summons a monster for “Last Turn”, then the special Battle Phase occurs, then in the End Phase the victory check is applied. This is an example of how the special nature of “Last Turn” works: the only thing that happens when “Last Turn” resolves is to select 1 monster and send all other cards to the Graveyard.
*   “Last Turn” is not a card that Special Summons a monster when it resolves. Therefore you can activate “Last Turn” even while “Jowgen the Spiritualist” is face-up on the field. If the player activating “Last Turn” controls “Jowgen the Spiritualist” and selects it as the monster to keep, the opponent cannot Special Summon for “Last Turn”, and there will be no special Battle Phase. However the victory check is still applied in the End Phase.
*   The special Battle Phase for “Last Turn” happens right after the monster is Special Summoned. It is in addition to the normal Battle Phase and does not disrupt the normal order of the turn. For example, if “Last Turn” is activated during the Draw Phase, resolves the effect, Special Summon, initiate the special Battle Phase, then continue with the Draw Phase. The turn player can have a normal Battle Phase later in the turn.
*   The special Battle Phase is treated like a standard Battle Phase in every other way, with a Start Step, Battle Step, Damage Step, and End Step. Only the selected monster and the Special Summoned monster can battle.
*   If you activate “Last Turn” and select your “The Rock Spirit” or “Soul of Purity and Light” their effects will be applied during your opponent’s special Battle Phase. Also any Flip Effects are resolved as normal, etc. You can use the effect of “Injection Fairy Lily” and other monster effects during the special Battle Phase.
*   The effect that reduces Battle Damage to zero applies only for the special Battle Phase, not for the normal Battle Phase. Example: A player activates “Last Turn” and selects their Defense Position “Spirit Reaper”. The turn player Special Summons “Enraged Battle Ox” and attacks in the special Battle Phase, but no damage occurs. However, during the turn player’s normal Battle Phase they can attack again, and will inflict 1500 points of damage due to the effect of “Enraged Battle Ox”, so the opponent’s Life Points will be zero and the turn player will win.
*   If the Battle Phase is skipped because of “Thunder of Ruler” or “Soul Exchange”, resolve the effects of “Last Turn” as much as possible (including victory check, quite possibly resulting in a DRAW).
*   You can chain to the activation of “Last Turn” with cards like “Ring of Destruction”, “Offerings to the Doomed”, or “Compulsory Evacuation Device” to eliminate the opponent’s monsters. If the player who activated “Last Turn” has no monsters on the field when it resolves, the effects of “Last Turn” are not negated. So the turn player still Special Summons a monster, although the special Battle Phase is not conducted, but the victory check in the End Phase is still performed.
*   The victory check for “Last Turn” is an effect that must be resolved by the player who activated it. The turn player still has priority to activate and resolve any other effects first. You cannot chain to the victory check of “Last Turn”.
*   If your opponent activates “Last Turn” and you Special Summon “Dark Magician of Chaos” from your Deck, you can activate his effect to add a Spell Card from your Graveyard to your hand.
*   After “Last Turn” sends all cards to the Graveyard, before the Special Summon for “Last Turn” is performed, monster effects like “Despair from the Dark”, “Elephant Statue of Disaster”, and “Regenerating Mummy” will activate.
*   If “Night Assailant” is sent from the hand to the Graveyard by the effect of “Last Turn”, resolve the effect of “Night Assailant” before Special Summoning for “Last Turn”.
*   If your opponent activates “Last Turn” and you Special Summon a monster that can attack twice, it can attack twice during the special Battle Phase (important if the opponent had a monster like “Big Core”).
*   “Last Turn” as a chain to “Change of Heart”: Suppose the turn player activates “Change of Heart” and the opponent chains “Last Turn”, then the opponent selects the monster targeted by “Change of Heart” for “Last Turn” (since it’s still on his side of the field, as “Change of Heart” hasn’t resolved yet). Then “Change of Heart” resolves and the turn player gains control of the monster, then Special Summons for “Last Turn”. There is no special Battle Phase. Assuming that the opponent somehow survives the standard Battle Phase, during the End Phase, the turn player has priority to activate and resolve an effect. If the turn player activates and resolves “Change of Heart”, then the monster goes back to the opponent and (assuming nothing else has happened), both players each have 1 monster and the result is a DRAW. If the turn player passes priority to the opponent, the opponent can activate and resolve the effect of “Last Turn” before “Change of Heart”, and in this case the turn player still has 2 monsters and the opponent has zero, so the turn player would win. If the turn player passed priority to the opponent and the opponent passes it back, the turn player MUST activate and resolve an effect, so the effect of “Change of Heart” would expire and both players would have 1 monster each, resulting in a DRAW.
*   You cannot Special Summon a monster for “Last Turn” that is a “Special Summon-only” monster like “Chaos Emperor Dragon – Envoy of the End”, “Dark Necrofear”, or “Ocean Dragon Lord – Neo-Daedalus”. Nor can you select a Spirit Monster because they cannot be Special Summoned.
*   You CAN Special Summon a high-level monster that has no Special Summoning restrictions for “Last Turn”, such as “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” or “Dark Magician of Chaos”.
*   If you activate “Last Turn” and select your face-up “Thousand-Eyes Restrict”, the turn player cannot attack so unless they can destroy your “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” with a card effect, each of you will have a monster during the End Phase and the Duel will end in a DRAW.
*   While your Life Points are 1000 or less, you can activate “Last Turn” in any part of your opponent’s turn, except the Damage Step. You can even activate it during the End Phase.
*   If “Last Turn” is activated and the turn player has no monsters to Summon, there is no battle however the victory check is still applied.
*   If you activate “Last Turn” during the Draw Phase or Standby Phase, and select your face-up “Jowgen the Spiritualist”, your opponent can still retrieve their “Sinister Serpent”, Summon it normally in Main Phase 1, and attack and destroy “Jowgen the Spiritualist” in the normal Battle Phase, then win the Duel in the End Phase because of the victory check of “Last Turn”.
*   If “Jinzo” is Special Summoned by the effect of “Last Turn”, “Jinzo” does not negate the special Battle Phase or victory check because “Last Turn” has already resolved and been sent to the Graveyard, so it is no longer on the field for “Jinzo” to negate.
*   If a player’s Life Points are reduced to zero during the special Battle Phase of “Last Turn”, or afterwards during the normal course of the turn, then that player loses. Example: “Giant Germ” is Special Summoned by the turn player and is destroyed as a result of battle, and the opponent had 500 or fewer Life Points when activating “Last Turn”.
*   If you activate “Last Turn” and then your Life Points increase above 1000 later, the effects of “Last Turn” are still applied.
*   If the turn player Special Summons “Mystic Tomato” for “Last Turn”, and attacks, and “Mystic Tomato” is destroyed, its effect activates and a monster is Special Summoned, but that new monster cannot attack during the special Battle Phase. (But it can attack during the standard Battle Phase.)
*   If the turn player Special Summons “Sangan” for “Last Turn”, and “Sangan” is destroyed during the special Battle Phase, then its effect is resolved. If the turn player hasn’t Normal Summoned a monster that turn, they can Summon the monster retrieved with “Sangan” during their Main Phase (and attack during their standard Battle Phase). This can result in a DRAW.
*   If you activate “Last Turn” and select your “Dark Necrofear”, and it’s destroyed during the special Battle Phase, you can select which effect resolves first during the End Phase: “Dark Necrofear” or “Last Turn”. So you can choose to resolve “Dark Necrofear” first, equip it to your opponent’s monster and take control of it, then resolve “Last Turn” and win because only you control a monster.
*   Vs. “Sanga of the Thunder”, “Kazejin”, “Suijin”: If the turn player Special Summons any of these monsters for “Last Turn”, he cannot activate the effect. However, if the player who activates “Last Turn” selects one of these monsters, he can activate the effect during the special Battle Phase.
*   The monster selected by the player activating “Last Turn” can be face-up or face-down, in Attack or Defense Position.
*   If the turn player Special Summons “Twin-Headed Behemoth” and it is destroyed during the special Battle Phase, during the End Phase the turn player has priority to activate and resolve an effect first, so he can choose the effect of “Twin-Headed Behemoth” and Special Summon it to the field before the victory check of “Last Turn”.
*   If the effect of “Non Aggression Area” is being applied and you activate “Last Turn”, your opponent does not Special Summon from the Deck for “Last Turn”.
*   “Last Turn” does not target so you can select monsters like “Tyrant Dragon” and “Fiend Skull Dragon” for its effect, or a Dragon-Type monster while “King Dragun” or “Lord of D.” is on the field. You can select “Spirit Reaper” and it will not be destroyed by its effect.
*   You can activate “Last Turn” and select your opponent’s monster that you control with “Snatch Steal”. However, after selecting it, “Snatch Steal” is sent to the Graveyard so control of the monster returns to the turn player. The turn player then Special Summons for “Last Turn” but no special Battle Phase is conducted. The victory check is still conducted in the End Phase.
*   If you activate “Last Turn” and select a monster that was Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted”, when “Call of the Haunted” is sent to the Graveyard by “Last Turn”, your selected monster is destroyed. But if you selected a monster Special Summoned by “Premature Burial”, the selected monster is not destroyed when “Premature Burial” is sent to the Graveyard by “Last Turn”.
*   If both monsters that battle for “Last Turn” are removed from play (such as with “D.D. Warrior Lady”) then the result is a DRAW.
*   If “Obnoxious Celtic Guard” battles a monster for “Last Turn”, its effect is applied and it is not destroyed if it battles a monster with 1900 or higher ATK.
*   “Waboku” can be activated before “Last Turn”, or be chained to the activation of “Last Turn”, and in either case the effect of “Waboku” will prevent the activator’s monster from being destroyed. This can lead to a DRAW.
*   If the turn player activated “Last Will” before “Last Turn” was activated, a monster can be Special Summoned by the effect of “Last Will” during the special Battle Phase (but it cannot attack during the special Battle Phase).
*   You can activate “Wall of Revealing Light” (paying its cost) and chain “Last Turn”.
*   If “Pyramid of Light”, “Andro Sphinx”, and “Sphinx Teleia” are all sent to the Graveyard by “Last Turn”, “Theinen the Great Sphinx” is not Special Summoned because the effect of “Pyramid of Light” activates its effect, but then looks for “Andro Sphinx” and “Sphinx Teleia” and does not find them on the field, so it cannot destroy them with its effect.
*   If the battle for “Last Turn” is conducted and the defending monster was “Wall of Illusion”, but it is destroyed, the attacking monster is returned to the turn player’s hand. The turn player can then Normal Summon the monster in the Main Phase (unless it has passed).

  
## LAST WILL

*   You can activate “Last Will” before or after a monster is sent to the Graveyard, and still get the effect of “Last Will” to Special Summon a monster.
*   You can choose the timing for when you Special Summon for the effect of “Last Will”. You can Special Summon the monster at any time during your turn, except during damage calculation. You do not have to Special Summon the monster at the point the first monster was sent to the Graveyard. If you activated “Last Will” after a monster was sent to the Graveyard, you do not have to Special Summon the monster when “Last Will” resolves.
*   If you wish, you may Special Summon the monster immediately after “Last Will” resolves (if activated after a monster was destroyed), or when the first monster is sent to the Graveyard (if “Last Will” was activated before the monster was destroyed). But you don’t have to, you can do it later.
*   For example, if your monster is destroyed by battle, and you activate “Last Will” during Main Phase 2, you can Special Summon a monster at that time. Or you can wait and Special Summon during the End Phase.
*   You can apply the effect of “Last Will” as long as a monster on your side of the field is (or was) sent to your Graveyard, no matter which Phase it was in. As long as it’s the same turn in which you activated “Last Will”.
*   If you activate 2 "Last Wills", then you get to Special Summon 2 monsters, as long as a monster is (or was) sent from your side of the field to your Graveyard that same turn.
*   You only Special Summon 1 monster for each 1 "Last Will".
*   If you Special Summon using "Last Will’s" effect, then you don’t get to Special Summon for it again (but you do for any other copies of “Last Will” that are activated). If you activate “Last Will”, and the end of the turn arrives without using "Last Will’s" effect, then the effect is gone.
*   You can Special Summon for “Last Will” if a monster was Tributed for a Tribute Summon, or for "Cannon Soldier’s" effect, etc.
*   You can use "Last Will’s" effect to Special Summon a Level 5 or higher monster like "Labyrinth Wall".
*   You cannot Special Summon a "Special Summon-only" monster.
*   "Last Will’s" effect can only be used if your OWN monster is (or was) sent from YOUR side of the field to YOUR Graveyard.
*   If your monster is sent to your Graveyard by battle, you resolve "Last Will’s" effect during that same Battle Phase (but not during the Damage Step). If it’s your turn, then your newly Summoned monster can attack before Main Phase 2.
*   If "Imperial Order" is activated after "Last Will" has resolved, it will not negate "Last Will"'s effect.
*   You can Special Summon a 1500 ATK monster that will have higher than 1500 ATK after being Summoned, such as a Fiend with 1500 original ATK while "Yami" is on the field (its ATK once Summoned will be 1700). You can Special Summon "Muka Muka" even if you have 6 cards in your hand and "Muka Muka"'s ATK, once Summoned, will be higher than 1500.

  
## LAVA GOLEM  
> This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set. Ⓢ This card can only be Special Summoned to your opponent's side of the field by Tributing 2 monsters they control. Ⓒ You cannot Normal Summon or Set the turn you Special Summon this card. ① Take 1000 points of damage during each of your Standby Phases.

*   The Ⓢ Special Summon does not start a chain.
    *   Once Summoned, "Call of the Haunted" / "Return from the Different Dimension" can Summon it later.
    *   You cannot play "Bottomless Trap Hole" when Summoning this card to your opponent's field.
    *   You cannot play "Black Horn of Heaven" when Summoning this card to your opponent's field.
    *   You can play "Solemn Judgment" when Summoning this card to your opponent's field.
    *   You Tribute your opponent's monsters as cost.
    *   You can't Tribute your opponent's "Vanity's Fiend" for this Summon.
    *   You can't Tribute your opponent's non-FIRE monsters while "Gozen Match" applies.
    *   You can't Tribute your opponent's non-Fiend-Type monsters while "Rivalry of Warlords" applies.
*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated. It is not an effect.
    *   You can't Special Summon "Lava Golem" AFTER you Normal Summon / Set a monster.
    *   You can't Special Summon "Lava Golem" if your Normal Summon was negated by "Solemn Judgment".
*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates during the Standby Phase of this card's controller.
    *   This effect deals damage even if this card is flipped face-down / leaves the field / changes control.

  
## LAYARD THE LIBERATOR

*   The effect of “Layard the Liberator” is a Continuous Effect, and cannot be chained to. You will add 2 of your Fairy-Type monsters to your hand immediately after a Counter Trap’s effects have resolved.
*   “Layard the Liberator’s” effect will not activate if you have only 1 Fairy-Type monster removed from play.
*   This effect targets 2 Fairy-Type monsters.

  
## LEGACY HUNTER

*   If your "Legacy Hunter" attacks your monster (controlled by your opponent) on your opponent's side of the field, "Legacy Hunter'"s effect still activates and your opponent returns a card to the Deck.
*   If "Legacy Hunter" attacks a face-down "Man-Eater Bug" or "Cyber Jar", "Legacy Hunter"'s effect is not applied because "Legacy Hunter"'s effect activates when the monster he destroyed is sent to the Graveyard, and "Legacy Hunter" will no longer be on the field in these instances.
*   The monster that "Legacy Hunter" attacks must be face-down at the start of the Damage Step for "Legacy Hunter"'s effect to activate. So if "Legacy Hunter" attacks a face-down Defense Position monster and your opponent activates "Ceasefire" to flip the monster face-up, "Legacy Hunter’s" effect is NOT applied. Also, if "Legacy Hunter" attacks a face-up monster and "Book of Moon" flips it face-down, "Legacy Hunter"'s effect DOES apply.

  
## LEGACY OF YATA-GARASU

*   When you activate “Legacy of Yata-Garasu” while your opponent has a Spirit Monster face-up on his/her side of the field and you select to activate the second effect of “Legacy of Yata-Garasu”, if your opponent chains an effect that removes the Spirit Monster from the field or flips it face-down, the effect of “Legacy of Yata-Garasu” will still resolve.

  
## LEGENDARY BLACK BELT

*   “Legendary Black Belt” inflicts damage based on the original DEF of the destroyed monster (in the Graveyard).
*   If a monster equipped with “Legendary Black Belt” is destroyed, no damage is inflicted by the effect of “Legendary Black Belt” because it is no longer on the field. This includes if it attacked a monster with equal ATK, for example.
*   After the monster is sent to the Graveyard after being destroyed as a result of battle, the effect of “Legendary Black Belt” that inflicts effect damage can be chained to.

  
## LEGENDARY EBON STEED

*   This card’s effect to destroy itself does not start a Chain.
*   If you control 2 “Six Samurai” monsters, and 1 of them equipped with “Legendary Ebon Steed” would be destroyed, the effect of “Legendary Ebon Steed” must be used. You cannot choose to destroy another “Six Samurai” monster instead.
*   If you control 2 “Six Samurai” monsters, one equipped with “Legendary Ebon Steed” and one without, and the unequipped monster would be destroyed, you can use its final effect to destroy the equipped “Six Samurai” instead. “Legendary Ebon Steed” will then be destroyed instead of that “Six Samurai”.
*   If you control 2 “Six Samurai” monsters that would be destroyed at the same time, and a third “Six Samurai” monster equipped with “Legendary Ebon Steed”, you can destroy the third “Six Samurai” to save one of the other two. “Legendary Ebon Steed” would be destroyed instead. There is no way to destroy the third “Six Samurai” and destroy “Legendary Ebon Steed” to save the other 2 “Six Samurai”.
*   If multiple copies of “Legendary Ebon Steed” are equipped to the same “Six Samurai” monster and that monster would be destroyed, all of the “Legendary Ebon Steeds” are destroyed.

  
## LEGENDARY FIEND

*   When "Legendary Fiend" is removed from the field or flipped face-down, the ATK gain disappears.
*   When control of "Legendary Fiend" shifts to another player, the ATK gain is still applied.
*   When "Legendary Fiend" is equipped with "Megamorph", first double or halve its original ATK and then reapply the ATK gain.
*   If you Special Summon "Legendary Fiend" during your Standby Phase, its effect activates during that same Standby Phase.
*   If "Legendary Fiend" is equipped with your opponent's "Blast Sphere", you can choose to activate "Legendary Fiend"'s effect or pass to your opponent. If they decide to pass, you must activate "Legendary Fiend"'s effect.
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, the ATK gain disappears. When "Skill Drain" is negated or removed from the field, the ATK gain is not reapplied.

  
## LEGENDARY FLAME LORD

*   You place a Spell Counter on this card when the Spell Card resolves, so if "Magic Jammer" is used to negate the Spell Card's activation then you do not place a Spell Counter on this monster. But if "Imperial Order" is chained to the Spell Card, you still place a Spell Counter on this monster because the activation of the Spell Card was not negated. If the Spell Card was a Continuous, Equip, or Field Spell Card, and “Dust Tornado” is chained to its activation and destroys it before it resolves you still place a Spell Counter because the activation of the card was not negated.
*   If you activate a Spell Card, and your opponent chains "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Legendary Flame Lord", "Legendary Flame Lord" does not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card because "Legendary Flame Lord" must be face-up on the field when the Spell Card is activated and when it resolves in order to get a Spell Counter.

  
## LEGENDARY JUJITSU MASTER  
> ① A monster that battles with this Defense Position card is returned to the top of its owner’s Deck at the end of the Damage Step.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   This effect activates if Jujitsu Master engaged in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.
    *   This effect activates even if Jujitsu Master is not face-up on the field.
    *   This effect forms a Chain with other cards that activate at the same time (ex: "Destruction Punch").
*   VS. "Ehren, Lightsworn Monk": Jujitsu Master cannot activate its effect if it was shuffled into the Deck, because it did not engage in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.

  
## LEKUNGA

*   You cannot activate "Lekunga"'s effect if you do not have a vacant Monster Card Zone on your side of the field.

  
## LESSER FIEND

*   Monsters destroyed by this card as a result of battle are not sent to the Graveyard, so "Sangan" or "Mystic Tomato" would not have their effects activated, and the effect of "Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer" will not prevent them from being removed from play.
*   This card does not negate the effects of monsters it destroys as a result of battle, so a Flip Effect like "Cyber Jar" or Trigger Effect like "D.D. Warrior Lady" will still be activated. "Cyber Jar" would still be removed from play in this example, since damage calculation occurs normally.
*   If "Lesser Fiend" battles with "Relinquished" equipped with a Monster Card, and that equipped card is destroyed instead of "Relinquished", it is not removed from play since it is the effect of "Relinquished" that destroyed it and not as a result of battle with "Lesser Fiend".

  
## LEVEL CONVERSION LAB

*   When you resolve the effect of “Level Conversion Lab”, show the card to your opponent then roll the die.
*   The Level of a monster can go up or down with “Level Conversion Lab”.
*   If “Cost Down” resolves and lowers the Levels of monsters in your hand, then you use “Level Conversion Lab”, the effect of “Level Conversion Lab” overwrites the effect of “Cost Down”. But if you resolve “Level Conversion Lab” first, and then activate and resolve “Cost Down”, “Cost Down” will lower whatever the result was from ”Level Conversion Lab”.
*   If you activate “Level Conversion Lab” and change “Levia-Dragon Daedalus” to a Level 5 monster, and “A Legendary Ocean” is on the field, then “Levia-Dragon Daedalus” is Level 4.
*   If you use “Level Conversion Lab” to change “The Masked Beast” to Level 3, you still need to Tribute 8 Levels worth of monsters for “Curse of the Masked Beast” or "Contract with the Abyss".
*   The Level change from “Level Conversion Lab” lasts until the end of the turn, even if the monster is Summoned. So if you change “Summoned Skull” to Level 3, and Summon it, it can attack even if “Gravity Bind” is active.

  
## LEVEL DOWN!

*   You can use “Level Down!?” on a “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” that is copying an LV monster. But since it is no longer copying the LV monster after it has been returned to the Deck, no monster will be Special Summoned.
*   You can use "Level Down!?" on "Armed Dragon LV10" to Special Summon "Armed Dragon LV7".

  
## LEVEL EATER  
> ① If this card in in the Graveyard, you can activate its effect by selecting 1 face-up Level 5 or higher monster you control. Reduce that monster’s Level by 1. Special Summon this card from the Graveyard. This can cannot be Tributed except for a Tribute Summon.

*   This ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect targets a Level 5+ monster you control.
    *   If the target's Level cannot be reduced, "Level Eater" remains in the Graveyard.
    *   If the target’s Level is <5 when this effect resolves, reduce it’s Level and Summon "Level Eater".
    *   If "Level Eater" leaves the Graveyard before this effect resolves, you still reduce the target’s Level.
    *   That monster's Level is reduced so long as it remains face-up on the field.

  
## LEVEL LIMIT - AREA A

*   If this card is face-up on the field and a face-down Level 3 or lower monster is attacked, after it is flipped face-up it will be changed to Attack Position before damage calculation.

  
## LEVEL LIMIT - AREA B

*   The effect of "Level Limit - Area B" does not use the chain, it is a continuous effect.
*   All Level 4 or higher monsters face-up on the field after "Level Limit - Area B" resolves will be in Defense Position. You can change the Battle Position of a Level 4 or higher monster, but it will immediately be changed back to Defense Position because of "Level Limit - Area B"'s effect.
*   If "Level Limit - Area B" is activated while "Final Attack Orders" is active, then the most recently resolved effect takes precedence and monsters Level 4 or higher will be in Defense Position.
*   If you Summon “Spell Canceller” while “Level Limit - Area B” is on the field, “Spell Canceller” negates its effect and is not changed to Defense Position.

  
## LEVEL MODULATION

*   An “LV” monster that normally cannot be Special Summoned except by the method in its text CANNOT be Special Summoned from the Graveyard with “Level Modulation” unless it has been previously Special Summoned by the correct procedure. The “ignore the Summoning conditions” text allows for these monsters to be Special Summoned only after they have been properly Summoned by their own effect. This applies to “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8”, “Armed Dragon LV7”, “Silent Swordsman LV7”, “Silent Magician LV8”, and “Winged Kuriboh LV10”.
*   You cannot activate “Level Modulation” if the opponent has 1 or less card in their Deck, or if you have “Protector of the Sanctuary” on the field.
*   Even Continuous Effects on the Special Summoned Monster, like “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6”, are not applied during the turn this card is used to Special Summon that monster.
*   If the monster Special Summoned by this card’s effect is flipped face-down, then the restrictions of “Level Modulation” are no longer applied. If you flip it face-up again, it can attack and its effects are applied.

  
## LEVEL RETURNER

*   This is a targeted effect.
*   You decide whether to reduce the target’s Level by 1 or 2 when the effect resolves.
*   The Level reduction lasts as long as the target remains face-up on the field.

  
## LEVEL TUNING

*   Only face-up monsters you control when resolving "Level Tuning" are affected. Monsters Summoned afterwards will not have their Level reduced.

  
## LEVEL UP!

*   Sending a monster to the Graveyard is a cost for "Level Up!"

  
## LEVEL WARRIOR  
> Ⓢ If there are no monsters on the field, you can Normal Summon this card from your hand as a Level 2 monster. Ⓤ If your opponent controls a monster and you control no monsters, you can Special Summon this card from your hand as a Level 4 monster.

*   The Ⓤ Unclassified summon effect does not start a Chain.
*   “Skill Drain” has no effect on “Level Warrior’s” Level, because “Level Warrior” is considered to already be on the field with the appropriate level. So “Skill Drain” will not cause “Level Warrior’s” Level to become 3.
*   Even if “Level Warrior” becomes Level 5 or 6 due to “Level Conversion Lab,” you can still Summon it as a Level 2 or 4 monster with its effect.

  
## LEVIA-DRAGON - DAEDALUS

*   You can send "A Legendary Ocean" to the Graveyard to activate "Levia-Dragon Daedalus"' effect, but you can't send "Maiden of the Aqua".
*   You can't send a face-down "Umi" or "A Legendary Ocean" to activate "Levia-Dragon Daedalus"' effect.
*   If you activate "Levia-Dragon Daedalus"' effect and your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to destroy "Levia-Dragon Daedalus", "Levia-Dragon Daedalus"' effect still resolves even though it has been destroyed.
*   If an effect is chained to “Levia-Dragon Daedalus'” effect to flip “Levia-Dragon Daedalus" face-down, it is still not destroyed by its effect.

  
## LICH LORD, KING OF THE UNDERWORLD

*   This card's effect will be activated if it is Tributed from the hand for a Ritual Spell Card.
*   See "Diabolos, King of the Abyss" for Tribute Summon rulings.

  
## LIFE ABSORBING MACHINE

*   "The total Life Points you paid" is defined as the Life Points paid for costs (both activation costs and maintenance costs) of cards. It does not include damage or loss of Life Points. Damage is not included even if the damage was caused by an effect you control, such as if you activate "Ring of Destruction".
*   "In your last turn" is defined as the period from the start of your previous turn’s Draw Phase to the end of that turn’s End Phase. Cost that you paid during your opponent’s turn that occurred between your last turn and the current turn are not included.
*   The effect of "Life Absorbing Machine" increases your Life Points for each cost you paid separately. So if you had "Fire Princess" on the field, and you paid 2 costs during your last turn, "Fire Princess" will deal 1000 points of damage to the opponent.
*   "Life Absorbing Machine" does not have to be active at the time the Life Points were paid. If you pay a cost of 2000 Life Points during your turn, then activate "Life Absorbing Machine" during your opponent’s turn, the effect of "Life Absorbing Machine" will increase your Life Points by 1000 during your Standby Phase.
*   Example: It is your turn. During your Standby Phase you pay 500 Life Points for your "Terrorking Archfiend". During your Main Phase 1 you activate "Life Absorbing Machine". Then you activate "Delinquent Duo" and pay 1000 Life Points for its cost. You Set "Seven Tools of the Bandit" and end your turn. During your opponent’s turn they activate "Reinforcements" and you chain "Seven Tools of the Bandit" to negate and destroy it. Your opponent ends their turn. During your Standby Phase the effect of "Life Absorbing Machine" increases your Life Points by 250 (half of "Terrorking Archfiend"’s cost) then again by 500 (half of "Delinquent Duo"’s cost).
*   If you have two copies of "Life Absorbing Machine" on the field, their effects are cumulative.

  
## LIFEFORCE HARMONIZER  
> ① When your opponent activates a card's effect that inflicts damage, you can discard this card to negate its activation and destroy it.  
  

*   The ① Quick Effect can be activated during either player’s turn.
*   This effect can only respond to the activation of a card that is confirmed to inflict damage at resolution.
    *   You can use “Lifeforce Harmonizer” on your opponent’s card that inflicts damage to themselves, such as “Zombie Mammoth” if there is a situation where it will inflict damage to the opponent.
    *   This effect can be activated if "Caius the Shadow Monarch" targets a face-up DARK monster.
*   This effect cannot respond to a card / effect that does not / might not inflict damage at resolution.
    *   It cannot be used against the activation of “Wave-Motion Cannon” or the activation of the effect of “Wave-Motion Cannon” \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=845835)\].
    *   It cannot be used against “Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch” since you don’t know if damage will be inflicted.
    *   If you control “Des Wombat” and it is preventing you from taking damage, you cannot activate “Lifeforce Harmonizer”.

  
## LIGHT AND DARKNESS DRAGON
> Ⓒ This card cannot be Special Summoned. ① While this card is face-up on the field its Attribute is also treated as DARK. ② When a Spell or Trap Card is activated, or the effect of an Effect Monster is activated, that activation is negated and this card loses 500 ATK and DEF. ③ When this card is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, select 1 monster in your Graveyard. Then destroy all cards you control, and Special Summon that monster.

*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated.
*   The ① Continuous Effect only applies on the field.
    *   Effects which affect LIGHT or DARK monsters affect this card.
    *   This card is sent to the Graveyard while "Gozen Match" is active.
*   The ② mandatory Quick Effect ALWAYS activates (even if this card has <500 ATK or DEF).
    *   ATK / DEF changes apply so long as this card is face-up on the field.
    *   This effect only activates once per chain, at the earliest opportunity.
    *   This effect can chain to a monster effect activated from any location.
    *   This effect can chain to the activation of a Spell / Trap Card (when it is played face-up).
        *   A Continuous Spell / Trap Card whose activation was negated is sent to the Graveyard.
    *   This effect cannot chain to the activated effect of a Spell / Trap card that is already face-up / in the Graveyard (such as "Blaze Accelerator" or "Skill Successor", or a Normal Spell Card sent to the Graveyard by "Destiny Hero Diamond Dude").
    *   If this card cannot lose 500 ATK and 500 DEF, this effect does not negate anything.
    *   If you control 2 "Light and Darkness Dragon" and a Spell / Trap Card / monster effect is activated, you choose the order in which their effects go on Chain. When the Chain resolves, the "Light and Darkness Dragon" whose effect was Chain Link 3 resolves without effect, since it was not directly Chained to the effect activated as Chain Link 1, and it won't lose ATK or DEF.
    *   VS. "Shrink": This card's original ATK is halved, then apply all previous ATK losses.
    *   VS. "Reverse Trap": this effect can only activate once after "Reverse Trap" resolves. When it does, it will gain 500 ATK and DEF instead of losing 500 ATK and DEF.
*   The ③ mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect activates so long as it is sent to the Graveyard when destroyed, whether it was destroyed in the hand, Deck, on the field, or while equipped to "Relinquished".

    *   This effect targets a monster (if any) in your Graveyard. It is negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   This effect resolves sequentially: destroy all cards you control, then Summon the target \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=492019)\].
        *   Destroy all cards you control, even if the target cannot be Special Summoned.
        *   If "Peten the Dark Clown" you control is destroyed, and then you Special Summon the target, Peten cannot activate its effect \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=492019)\].
*   NOTE: This card received an erratum with [Problem-Solving Card Text](https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?p=4514) in Astral Pack 2 (2013). The TCG rulings were updated, changing the ③ Trigger Effect so that both parts resolved simultaneously. In Edison Format, play with the same rules the OCG used and resolve this effect sequentially.

> Konami policy regarding card legality and cards with [erratas](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Errata) (section IX. subsection G. of the [policy document](https://img.yugioh-card.com/en/gameplay/penalty_guide/YGOTCG_Policy_v_2_1.pdf)) state that "you are required to play all copies of your cards according to the most recent text". Therefore, the language used and the consequences of this erratum are essential to authentic Edison Format play.

  
## LIGHT BARRIER

*   "Light Barrier"'s effect to flip a coin during the Standby Phase starts a Chain.
*   The effect of the Summoned "Arcana Force" monster still starts a Chain, but you do not toss the coin. When the effect resolves you will select if the heads or tails effect is applied.
*   If an "Arcana Force" monster's effect is chosen in this way, it cannot be selected with "Reversal of Fate" or "Arcana Call".
*   "Light Barrier"'s effect to gain Life Points starts a Chain when the opponent's monster is sent to the Graveyard or Removed Zone at the end of the Damage Step.
*   If your "Arcana Force" monster is also destroyed in the battle, "Light Barrier"'s effect still activates.
*   Only the controller of "Light Barrier" activates its effects.

  
## LIGHT END DRAGON  
> ① When this monster battles, you can activate this card’s effect at attack declaration. If you do, this card loses 500 ATK and DEF (permanently), and the monster it is battling loses 1500 ATK and DEF until the End Phase.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in Start of the Battle Step - Attack Declaration.
    *   This effect does not target the opponent's monster.
    *   This card loses 500 ATK and DEF when the effect resolves. This is not a cost.
    *   If the ATK and DEF of "Light End Dragon" is less than 500, you cannot activate its effect.
    *   If the opponent's monster has 0 ATK and 0 DEF, this effect cannot activate.
    *   If the opponent's monster has <1500 ATK / DEF, its ATK / DEF will become 0.
    *   If the opponent's monster leaves the field before this effect resolves, "Light End Dragon" still loses 500 ATK and DEF \[[REF](https://ms.yugipedia.com//a/af/Card_Rulings_-_Raging_Battle_v1.2.pdf)\].
    *   This effect decreases both monsters ATK / DEF, even if the attack is negated (by "Magic Cylinder").
*   VS. "Enemy Controller": if either effect of E-Con is chained to this effect, this card is no longer treated as 'battling'. Therefore, this card will lose 500 ATK and DEF, but the opponent's monster will not lose any.

  
## LIGHT OF INTERVENTION

*   You can activate (flip face-up) this card at any time; it does not need to be activated in response to a Summon.
*   The effect of this card applies to both players, and does not affect monsters that are already on the field face-down. These monsters remain face-down until flipped face-up as normal.
*   While this card is on the field, monsters can be Normal Summoned in face-up Defense Position, and can be the target of "Trap Hole" and will trigger effects like the effect of "Mysterious Puppeteer".
*   While this card is on the field, if a monster would be Special Summoned in face-down Defense Position (such as with "Cyber Jar" or "Nimble Momonga"), it is instead Special Summoned in face-up Defense Position.
*   While this card is on the field you cannot flip a monster face-down with "Book of Moon", "Darkness Approaches", etc.

  
## LIGHT OF JUDGMENT

*   "Light of Judgment" does NOT target. You select the card when "Light of Judgment"'s effect resolves.
*   You can look at your opponent's hand when you resolve "Light of Judgment"'s effect.
*   If your opponent chains "Mystical Space Typhoon" to "Light of Judgment" and destroys "The Sanctuary in the Sky", the effect of "Light of Judgment" is still applied.

  
## LIGHT OF REDEMPTION

*   If a LIGHT monster is removed from play face-down by "Different Dimension Capsule", etc., it cannot be selected with "Light of Redemption".
*   If your opponent removes your LIGHT monster from play with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter", you can select it with "Light of Redemption".

  
## LIGHT SPIRAL

*   "Light Spiral"'s effect starts a Chain.

  
## LIGHTEN THE LOAD

*   When you activate the effect of "Lighten the Load", your opponent gets to see the Level 7 or higher monster you add to your Deck.

  
## LIGHTFORCE SWORD

*   If you chain "Lightforce Sword" to your opponent's Ritual Spell Card and remove from play the only Ritual Monster they could Ritual Summon, the Ritual Spell Card's effect disappears.
*   If the Standby Phase of your opponent's 4th turn is skipped, the card remains removed from play face-down.
*   If your opponent adds 1 of your Spell Cards to their hand with "Graverobber" and it is removed from play with "Lightforce Sword", during the Standby Phase of your opponent's 4th turn it is placed into your Graveyard instead of your opponent's hand.

  
## LIGHT-IMPRISONING MIRROR

*   When determining if a monster’s effect should be negated by “Light-Imprisoning Mirror”, check the monster’s Attribute at the time its effect is resolved.
*   When a Non-LIGHT monster’s effect is activated while the monster and “Light-Imprisoning Mirror” are both face-up on the field, if you chain “DNA Transplant” and select “LIGHT”, the monster’s effect will be negated if the monster is still face-up on the field when its effect resolves because it is now a LIGHT monster.
*   “Light-Imprisoning Mirror” cannot negate the Continuous Effects of LIGHT monsters.

  
## LIGHTNING BLADE

*   If the equipped monster’s Type is changed into something besides Warrior-Type by "DNA Surgery" or "Scroll of Bewitchment", "Lightning Blade" will be destroyed.
*   If two copies of this card are equipped to a single monster, that monster’s ATK will increase by 1600 points, and the ATK of all WATER monsters will decrease by 1000 points.

  
## LIGHTNING PUNISHER

*   The effect of “Lightning Punisher” is a Trigger Effect. So it will start a new chain itself.
*   “Lightning Punisher” must have been on the field before the chain began and must have been on the field throughout the entire chain in order for its effect to activate.
*   The effect of “Lightning Punisher” targets.
*   The effect of “Lightning Punisher” will still activate even if some steps of the chain have their activation negated. (Or even if “Vanity’s Call” negates all Links in the chain.)

  
## LIGHTSWORN BARRIER

*   "Lightsworn Barrier" targets your opponent's attacking monster.
*   Sending two cards from the top of your Deck to the Graveyard is a cost.

  
## LIGHTSWORN SABRE

*   If "Lightsworn Sabre" is sent from your Deck to the Graveyard to pay a cost its effect cannot be activated.

  
## LIGHTWAVE TUNING

*   If a LIGHT Union monster is also treated as a Tuner monster with "Lightwave Tuning", when the Union monster is equipped to another monster it is no longer treated as a Tuner monster. If it is Special Summoned during the same turn, it is still not treated as a Tuner monster.

  
## LIMIT IMPULSE

*   Sending 2 cards from your hand to the Graveyard is a cost.
*   If you do not have enough available Monster Card Zones when this card resolves, you won’t Special Summon any “Soul Tokens.”
*   You cannot activate this card during the Damage Step.

  
## LIMIT REVERSE

*   Destroying the Special Summoned monster when it is changed to Defense Position, or when "Limit Reverse" is removed from the field, does not start a Chain.
*   If the Special Summoned monster is flipped face-down, "Limit Reverse"'s effect disappears.

  
## LIMITER REMOVAL  
> ① Double the ATK of all face-up Machine-Type monsters you control, until the end of this turn. Ⓛ During the End Phase, destroy all monsters that were affected by this effect.

*   The ① effect doubles the current ATK of your monsters, after applying ATK changes from other effects.
    *   Machine-Type monsters Summoned in the Chain before this card resolves are also affected.
    *   Machine-Type monsters Summoned after this card resolves are unaffected.
*   The Ⓛ Lingering Effect applies to all monsters affected by the ① effect.
    *   Machine-Type monsters Summoned after resolving this card are not destroyed.
    *   Affected Machine-Type monsters are not destroyed if they are: flipped face-down, become Equip Cards, leave the field, or change Monster Type (by "DNA Surgery").

  
## LINEAGE OF DESTRUCTION

*   This card targets 1 Level 8 monster you control.
*   You can activate this card when a Level 8 monster you control destroys a Defense Position monster by battle, and target that Level 8 monster. It will be able to attack once more (two times total).
*   You cannot target a monster that can already attack twice in the same Battle Phase.

  
## LINEAR ACCELERATOR CANNON

*   You can Tribute a Trap Monster like “Embodiment of Apophis” for this effect, but no damage will be inflicted.
*   If you have already activated a Spell Card, you cannot activate "Linear Accelerator Cannon" on the same turn.

  
## LITTLE-WINGUARD

*   "Little-Winguard"'s effect can be chained to.
*   Effects like "Spellbinding Circle" do not prevent you from using "Little-Winguard"'s effect.

  
## LONE WOLF

*   If you activate “Lone Wolf” targeting an appropriate monster, and later you Summon another monster, the effect of “Lone Wolf” is still applied.
*   If you target “Monk Fighter”, etc. with “Lone Wolf”, and “Monk Fighter” is later flipped face-down, the effect of “Lone Wolf” disappears and is not re-activated even if “Monk Fighter” is later flipped face-up again.
*   “Your opponent’s monster effects” on “Lone Wolf” means “the effects of monsters that your opponent controls”. So if your opponent uses “Monster Reborn” on your “Exiled Force”, they still cannot Tribute “Exiled Force” to destroy your “Monk Fighter” targeted by “Lone Wolf”.
*   If you Summon “Monk Fighter” and target it with “Lone Wolf”, and your opponent controls “Bug-Tusked Mammoth”, you can still attack that same turn with “Monk Fighter”.
*   If your “Master Monk” targeted with “Lone Wolf” attacks and destroys “D.D. Assailant”, “D.D. Assailant” is removed from play but “Master Monk” is not.
*   If your opponent Summons “Dark Jeroid” and reduces your “Monk Fighter” ATK by 800 points, then later you activate “Lone Wolf” targeting the “Monk Fighter”, it does not restore the ATK of “Monk Fighter”.
*   Your “Monk Fighter” targeted by “Lone Wolf” cannot be destroyed by the effect of “Tribe-Infecting Virus”. Furthermore, if it is the only monster on your side of the field, your opponent cannot discard cards to activate “Tribe-Infecting Virus” to destroy Rock-Type monsters, because it will have no effect.
*   If you have “Monk Fighter” targeted by “Lone Wolf”, the following are examples of monster effects that will NOT be negated because they are not applied to a monster: “Airknight Parshath” (damage is inflicted and a card is drawn), “Fiber Jar” (“Monk Fighter” is shuffled into the Deck), “Maju Garzett” (the ATK of “Maju Garzett” does not become 0), “Susa Soldier” (the damage to Life Points is still halved), “Dark Magician Girl” (her ATK is still increased by her effect), “Stone Statue of the Aztecs” (Battle Damage to your Life Points is doubled), “Amazoness Fighter” (opponent’s Battle Damage to their Life Points is still zero), “Amazoness Swords Woman” (Battle Damage is still redirected), and “Reflect Bounder” (you still take effect damage to your Life Points).
*   “Archfiend of Gilfer” and “Dark Necrofear” in the Graveyard can activate their effects and target “Monk Fighter” targeted by “Lone Wolf”. This is because they activate as Monster Cards, equip to the target monster, become treated as Equip Spell Cards, and THEN apply their effects (by which point they are now treated as Equip Spell Cards).
*   The effect of “Lone Wolf” will be negated by Jinzo even if targeting “Monk Fighter”.

  
## LONEFIRE BLOSSOM  
> ① Once per turn, you can Tribute 1 face-up Plant-Type monster to Special Summon 1 Plant-Type monster from your Deck.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Tributing 1 face-up Plant-Type monster is a cost. This card can be Tributed for its own effect.
    *   You cannot activate this effect if you cannot Special Summon a Plant-Type monster from your Deck.
    *   If this card's effect was negated by "Debris Dragon", this effect can activate but resolves negated.
*   VS. "Gozen Match": you can only activate the effect of "Lonefire Blossom" if you have a FIRE Plant-Type monster in your Deck; you cannot activate the effect if you do not have any FIRE Plant-Type monsters in your Deck. However, if Lonefire Tributes itself and afterwards there are no monsters on your field, then when resolving the effect of Lonefire you can choose to Special Summon a WIND monster like "Tytannial, Princess of Camellias".

  
## LORD BRITISH SPACE FIGHTER

*   This effect activates at the end of the Damage Step.
*   The second effect targets 1 Set card on the field.
*   Even if you activate the first effect of this card, you do not have to attack again in a row.
*   If both this and the opponent’s monster are destroyed by battle with each other, you can still activate the second or third effect of this card.

  
## LORD OF D.

*   "Lord of D." cannot negate effects; he only prevents Dragon-Type monsters from being selected as targets of effects. Once a target has been selected, the effect of "Lord of D." is irrelevant.
*   If your opponent activates "Ring of Destruction" targeting your "Lord of D." and you chain "D. Tribe" to change "Lord of D." to Dragon-Type, "Ring of Destruction" will still resolve and destroy "Lord of D." since he was selected as a target before he was changed into Dragon-Type. If your opponent activates "Ring of Destruction" targeting a Dragon-Type monster you control and you chain "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Lord of D." from your Graveyard, your Dragon-Type monster is still destroyed for the same reason.
*   If you have "Lord of D." on the field, and activate "Premature Burial" to Special Summon a Dragon-Type monster from your Graveyard, that is okay, but if your opponent later destroys "Premature Burial" your Dragon-Type monster is also destroyed because "Premature Burial" is NOT selecting your Dragon-Type as a target.
*   While you have "Lord of D." on the field you cannot equip your Dragon-Type monsters with Equip Spell Cards, but if you already have a Dragon-Type monster equipped with an Equip Spell Card when you Summon "Lord of D.", the Equip Spell card is not destroyed or negated, because "Lord of D." only prevents Dragon-Type monsters from being selected as a target.
*   "Lord of D." will NOT stop "Dark Hole", "Mirror Force", "Raigeki", "Fissure", "Smashing Ground", "Hammer Shot", or "Amazoness Archers", nor will he protect your Dragon-Type monsters from their effects, since these cards affect the whole field and do not select targets.

  
## LORD POISON

*   No card called "Lord Poison" can be Special Summoned by "Lord Poison"'s effect; either the one that was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle, or another copy of "Lord Poison" that was already in the Graveyard.

  
## LOST GUARDIAN

*   Whenever the number of your monsters removed from play changes, re-calculate the DEF of “Lost Guardian”. (Just like “Shadow Ghoul”, etc.)
    *   NOTE: When a monster is removed from play, it goes to a “removed zone” (for lack of a better term) of the original owner. If the opponent controlled it, it will return to the opponent’s side of the field when it returns to player, however it is considered to be in the original owner’s “removed zone” while out of play. This is important for effects such as “Lost Guardian”.
    *   Example: Player A controls 2 monsters. Player B activates “Change of Heart” to take control of one of them, then activates “Different Dimension Gate” to remove both from play. Both monsters are in Player A’s “removed zone” while removed from play (so Player A’s “Lost Guardian” would have 1400 DEF). When “Different Dimension Gate” is destroyed, the monster Player B took control of will return to Player B’s side of the field (if possible, if not it is destroyed) before returning to Player A’s side of the field.
*   Monsters removed from play and kept face-down, like with “Different Dimension Capsule” or “Lightforce Sword”, do NOT count towards the DEF of “Lost Guardian”.

  
## LUCKY CHANCE

*   "Lucky Chance"'s Trigger Effect is chained to the effect of the Effect Monster. You choose what you think the coin flip will be when you resolve "Lucky Chance"'s effect.
*   If you control 2 or more face-up "Lucky Chance", you will only call the coin toss once and you will draw 1 card if you call it right.
*   If you use the effect of "Second Coin Toss" to re-flip the coin, you do not reselect for "Lucky Chance".

  
## LUCKY CLOUD

*   If you Summon 2 or more “Cloudian” monsters with the same name during your turn and activate “Lucky Cloud” later in the same turn, you will still draw 2 cards during the End Phase.
*   The effect of drawing 2 cards during the End Phase of a turn you Summon 2 or more “Cloudian” monsters with the same name does not begin a Chain.
*   You cannot activate “Lucky Cloud” while “Protector of the Sanctuary” is face-up on your opponent’s side of the field.
*   You will draw 2 cards during the End Phase with the effect of “Lucky Cloud” when you Special Summon 2 “Cloudian Tokens” with the effect of “Cloudian – Sheep Cloud”.
*   Even if you Summon 2 different sets of “Cloudian” monsters with the same name during the turn, you will only draw 2 cards with the effect of “Lucky Cloud” in the End Phase.

  
## LUCKY IRON AXE

*   This card’s second effect activates in the Graveyard, and starts a Chain.
*   This effect will activate if “Lucky Iron Axe” is destroyed by a card chained to its activation.

  
## LUMINA, LIGHTSWORN SUMMONER  
> ① Once per turn, you can discard 1 card to Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower "Lightsworn" monster from your Graveyard. ② During each of your End Phases, send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.

*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect must resolve (even if the effect is negated) before the turn can end.
    *   If you do not have enough cards to send to the Graveyard remaining in your Deck when resolving this effect, all cards remaining in your Deck are sent to the Graveyard.
    *   If the activation of this effect is negated by "Light and Darkness Dragon", it will activate again in the same End Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
    *   If this effect resolves negated by "Skill Drain", it will not activate again in the same End Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
    *   The "Lightsworn" monster (or "Judgment Dragon") must remain face-up on the field in order to activate and resolve this effect.
    *   If your opponent activates "Book of Eclipse" after you resolve this effect, when "Book of Eclipse" resolves and your affected monsters are flipped face-up (and you draw 1 card for each) then each "Lightsworn" monster (or "Judgment Dragon") will once again activate this effect \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=678963)\]
*   ② VS. "Brain Control": Player A gains control of Player B's "Lightsworn" monster until the End Phase. During the End Phase, Player A may decide in which order to activate/resolve effects:
    1.  Player A resolves "Brain Control" first, restoring control of the "Lightsworn" monster to Player B. That "Lightsworn" monster is no longer controlled by the turn player, thus its effect will not activate.
    2.  Player A activates and resolves the "Lightsworn" monster's effect to send cards from the top of their Deck to the Graveyard. Then that "Lightsworn" monster is returned to Player B's control \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=653322)\].
*   ② VS. "Enemy Controller":
    *   During Player A's turn, Player B gains control of Player A's "Lightsworn" monster. During the End Phase, when control of the "Lightsworn" monster is restored to Player A, its mandatory Trigger Effect will activate \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/85182-judgment-dragon-and-enemy-controller/)\].

  
## LUMINOUS SOLDIER

*   If the ATK of "Luminous Soldier" is reduced to 0 because of the effect of "Fairy Box" the ATK will increase by 500 points in the Damage Step if it is battling with a DARK monster.
*   If the attack target of "Luminous Soldier" is redirected to a DARK monster by the effect of "Dreamsprite" the ATK of "Luminous Soldier" will then increase by 500 points.

  
## LYCANTHROPE

*   This is a Trigger Effect that activates when Battle Damage is inflicted.
*   This effect activates even if you have no Normal Monsters in your Graveyard when this card inflicts Battle Damage, although the effect will do no damage.

  
## LYLA, LIGHTSWORN SORCERESS  
> ① You can change this card from face-up Attack Position to face-up Defense Position and destroy 1 Spell or Trap Card your opponent controls. If you activate this effect, this card's battle position cannot be changed until the end of your next turn, except with a card effect. ② During each of your End Phases, send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard.

*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect must resolve (even if the effect is negated) before the turn can end.
    *   If you do not have enough cards to send to the Graveyard remaining in your Deck when resolving this effect, all cards remaining in your Deck are sent to the Graveyard.
    *   If the activation of this effect is negated by "Light and Darkness Dragon", it will activate again in the same End Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].

## MACHINA FORTRESS  
> Ⓢ You can discard Machine-Type monster(s) whose total Levels equal 8 or more to Special Summon this card from your hand or Graveyard. ① When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, select and destroy 1 card your opponent controls. ② When this face-up card you control is targeted by an opponent's Effect Monster's effect, look at your opponent's hand and discard 1 card from their hand.

    *   This does not apply if the equipped monster would be removed from play, returned to the hand / Deck, or flipped face-down by a card effect.

  
## MACHINE ASSEMBLY LINE  
> ① All face-up Machine-Type monsters on the field gain 200 ATK. ② Each time a Machine-Type monster(s) on the field is destroyed, place 2 Junk Counters on this card. ③ You can send this card to the Graveyard to select and Special Summon 1 Machine-Type monster from your Graveyard, whose Level is less than or equal to the number of Junk Counters on this card.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies to face-up Machine-Type monsters on BOTH sides of the field.
*   The ② Continuous-like Effect does not start a Chain.
    *   Junk Counters are placed when an effect resolves destroying a Machine-Type monster(s), or during the Damage Step when a Machine-Type monster is destroyed by battle.
    *   If multiple Machine-Type monsters are destroyed at the same time, you only place 2 Junk Counters.
    *   A Machine-Type monster treated as an Equip Card is destroyed, do not place any Junk Counters.
    *   If a face-down Machine-Type monster is destroyed you do not place any Junk Counters.
*   The ③ Ignition-like Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Sending this card to the Graveyard is a cost to activate the effect to Special Summon.
    *   This effect targets a Machine-Type monster at activation.

  
## MACHINE DUPLICATION  
> Select 1 face-up Machine-Type monster you control with 500 or less ATK. You can Special Summon up to 2 cards with the same name from your Deck.

*   This effect targets 1 face-up Machine-Type monster you control with 500 or less ATK.
    *   A monster with 500 or less ATk whose Type is Machine by "DNA Surgery" can be targeted.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down / leaves the field, you still Special Summon from the Deck.
    *   If the target has >500 ATK when this effect resolves, you still Special Summon from the Deck.
    *   If the target is not Machine-Type when this effect resolves, you still Special Summon from the Deck.
    *   You cannot target a Machine-Type monster if no cards in your Deck share its name (ex: Tokens).
*   VS. "Proto-Cyber Dragon": You Special Summon up to 2 "Cyber Dragons" from your Deck while its effect applies, but you can only Special Summon "Proto-Cyber Dragon" if its effect is negated by ("Skill Drain").

  
## MACHINE KING – 3000 B.C.

*   Tributing a monster is a cost.
*   You cannot Tribute this card to activate its effect.
*   You can Tribute Monster Tokens and “Machine King – 3000 B.C.” will gain ATK.
*   If “Skill Drain” is activated, “Machine King – 3000 B.C.” loses its ATK increase and will not regain it even if “Skill Drain” is destroyed.
*   This card’s effect is considered to be a monster effect. It is an Ignition Effect, Spell Speed 1.

  
## MACRO COSMOS  
> ① You can Special Summon 1 “Helios – The Primordial Sun” from your hand or Deck when you activate this card. ② While this card is on the field, any card sent to the Graveyard is removed from play instead.

*   The ① Effect is optional, you can activate this card without a Helios in the Deck.
    *   "Macro Cosmos" must remain face-up on the Field in order to successfully resolve its ① effect.
    *   Because of this effect, "Macro Cosmos" can be destroyed on activation by "Royal Oppression".
*   The ② Continuous-like Effect affects all cards that would be sent to the Graveyard.
    *   A Monster Tributed to Normal Summon "Jinzo" is still removed from play.
    *   Cards cannot be sent / discarded to the Graveyard. If a card's cost would do this, it cannot activate.
    *   Cards whose cost require a card(s) be discarded (ex: "Magic Jammer") can be activated.
    *   Cards / effects that send / discard a card(s) to the Graveyard at resolution can be activated.
        *   Examples: "Dark Grepher", "Foolish Burial", "Blaze Accelerator", and "Needlebug Nest".
    *   If a face-up "Archlord Kristya" would be sent from the field to the Graveyard (and removed from play), "Archlord Kristya’s" effect will still trigger and places it back on top of the Deck.
    *   If "Gravekeeper's Servant" is active, your opponent cannot declare an attack.

  
## MAD RELOADER

*   The two cards are sent from your hand to the Graveyard when "Mad Reloader"'s effect resolves. If you have 1 or less cards in your hand, "Mad Reloader"'s effect disappears.

  
## MAGE POWER

*   "Mage Power" includes itself, Field Spell Cards on your side of the field, and monsters acting like Equip Spell Cards, such as Union Monsters.
*   If you control "Cannon Soldier" equipped with "Mage Power", and you activate "Limiter Removal", then the ATK of "Cannon Soldier" is (1400 + 500 + 500) x 2 = 4800.

  
## MAGIC CYLINDER

*   The effect of "Magic Cylinder" negates the attack of one attacking monster, but that monster is still considered to have attacked and may not attack again or have its Battle Position manually changed.
*   Monsters that may attack twice during the Battle Phase, such as "Hayabusa Knight", that have their first attack negated by the effect of "Magic Cylinder" may still make a second attack.
*   If the attack of "Goblin Attack Force" or "Spear Dragon" is negated by the effect of "Magic Cylinder", they will not be changed to Defense Position, since Damage Calculation never occurred.
*   The Damage caused by this card’s effect is equal to the current ATK of the attacking monster.
*   If an effect is chained to "Magic Cylinder" that destroys the attacking monster, or removes the attacking monster from the turn player’s side of the field (including switching it to your control, or sending it to the owner’s hand), no damage is dealt by the effect of "Magic Cylinder".

  
## MAGIC HOLE GOLEM

*   This effect targets 1 face-up monster you control.
*   If you use “Shrink” on a monster whose ATK is halved by “Magic Hole Golem” the ATK becomes half of its original ATK. After “Shrink” is no longer applied, the ATK becomes the same as before “Magical Hole Golem” was activated.
*   If you control 2 “Magic Hole Golems” and target different monsters with their effects, neither monster can attack.

  
## MAGIC PLANTER

*   You can send a Trap Monster like “Embodiment of Apophis” to the Graveyard to pay the cost for “Magic Planter.”
*   You cannot send “Macro Cosmos” to the Graveyard to pay the cost of “Magic Planter,” since “Macro Cosmos” is preventing you from sending cards to the Graveyard as costs.

  
## MAGIC REFLECTOR

*   You can put 2 or more counters on a Spell Card if you activate 2 or more "Magic Reflectors". When the Spell Card is destroyed, remove the counters on it 1-by-1.
*   You can activate "Magic Reflector" and put a counter on a Monster Card equipped to "Relinquished", and if the equipped card would be destroyed, remove 1 counter instead.
*   If "Imperial Order" is active, and if a Spell Card with a counter on it would be destroyed, the counter is removed instead. "Imperial Order" does not negate the function of counters created by the effect of "Magic Reflector".
*   If a Spell Card with a maintenance cost has a counter on it, such as "Messenger of Peace", and you choose not to pay the cost, the Spell Card is still destroyed.
*   If a Field Spell Card has a counter on it and a player activates a new Field Spell Card, the Field Spell Card with the counter is still destroyed.
*   If "Swords of Revealing Light" has a counter on it, it is still destroyed at the end of the opponent’s third turn after it was activated.
*   If you use "Magic Reflector" to place a counter on a Union Monster that is an Equip Card, and the Union Monster would be destroyed instead of the equipped monster, remove the "Magic Reflector" counter from the Union Monster instead, and the Union Monster is not destroyed.

  
## MAGICAL ANDROID

*   Count the number of face-up Psychic-Type monsters when "Magical Android"'s effect resolves.

  
## MAGICAL BLAST

*   The number of Spellcaster-Type monsters is counted when “Magical Blast” resolves. If your opponent chains an effect to “Magical Blast” that destroys all of your Spellcasters, it still resolves but will do 0 damage.
*   The effect of “Magical Blast” that activates in the Draw Phase can be chained to.
*   If you have more than 1 “Magical Blast” in your Graveyard during your Draw Phase, you can activate them both, but only 1 will resolve. The other will remain in Graveyard. This forms a chain because they are activating simultaneously (at the specific point in time that you would otherwise draw). If you also have “Freed the Matchless General” on the field, you can only resolve either his effect or “Magical Blast’s” effect, but not both.
*   If you can not draw a card, either because you have no cards in your Deck, of because of a card effect, then you cannot activate the effect of “Magical Blast”.
*   Note that the effect of “Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi” resolves before the Draw Phase, so you could activate the effect of “Magical Blast” after his effect resolves.

  
## MAGICAL DIMENSION

*   Tributing a monster for “Magical Dimension” is not a cost; it’s part of the effect and happens when the effect resolves. If the effect of “Magical Dimension” is negated then you do not Tribute a monster.
*   You don’t have to destroy a monster when using “Magical Dimension”; it’s optional. If you do choose to destroy a monster, then it’s resolved at the same time as the rest of “Magical Dimension’s” effect.
*   Because you select which monster to destroy when “Magical Dimension” resolves, (not when it’s activated) “Magical Dimension” does not target.
*   You cannot activate “Magical Dimension” unless you have a Spellcaster-Type monster in your hand that can be Special Summoned with its effect.
*   If your opponent activates “Magical Dimension” and chooses not to destroy a monster on the field, then you can activate “Torrential Tribute” or “Bottomless Trap Hole” to destroy the Special Summoned Spellcaster. If your opponent does decide to destroy a monster, then you cannot activate these cards because the last thing to happen was not a monster being Summoned. So you have missed the timing.
*   You only need a Spellcaster-Type monster on the field when you activate “Magical Dimension”, not when it resolves. If your opponent chains an effect to destroy your Spellcasters, or flip them face-down, “Magical Dimension” still resolves as normal. Also note that you can Tribute your only Spellcaster for “Magical Dimension’s” effect and the rest of “Magical Dimension” will still resolve properly.
*   You cannot Tribute a monster for “Magical Dimension” that is “unaffected by Spell Cards” since Tributing is part of the effect of “Magical Dimension” (not a cost). If the only monster on your side of the field is “Gemini Elf” while “Non-Spellcasting Area” is active, then you could not activate “Magical Dimension”.
*   If you Special Summon “Dark Magician of Chaos” with “Magical Dimension”, then decide to destroy 1 monster on the field, then you will NOT get the effect of “Dark Magician of Chaos” because it misses the timing. If you choose not to destroy a monster, however, then his effect will activate. (See rulings for “Dark Magician of Chaos”).
*   You can Tribute a monster that was targeted by “Soul Exchange” for “Magical Dimension”.
*   You cannot chain “My Body as a Shield” to “Magical Dimension”, since destroying a monster on the field is optional.
*   If you Summon a monster like “Skilled Dark Magician” and the opponent activates “Bottomless Trap Hole”, you can chain “Magical Dimension” to Tribute “Skilled Dark Magician” and Special Summon another Spellcaster from your hand. This new monster will NOT be destroyed by “Bottomless Trap Hole”.

  
## MAGICAL EXPLOSION

*   Count the number of Spell Cards in the Graveyard at the time “Magical Explosion” resolves.

  
## MAGICAL HATS  
> Activate only during your opponent's Battle Phase. ① Select 2 non-Monster Cards from your Deck and 1 monster you control. Shuffle those 3 cards and Set them on the field in face-down Defense Position. ⒸThe 2 cards selected from your Deck are treated as monsters (ATK 0/DEF 0) and are destroyed at the end of the Battle Phase.

*   This card cannot be activated unless you can Special Summon both cards. You cannot activate this card while a "Barrier Statue" monster restricts you to Summoning monsters of a specific Attribute.
*   This card can activate in the Start Step (before Attack declaration), the Battle Step before \[but not during\] the Damage Step, and the End Step (before Main Phase 2) of your opponent's Battle Phase.
*   The ① effect Special Summons 2 non-Monster Cards (they are revealed to the opponent).
    *   The Special Summoned Cards DO NOT HAVE Levels, Attributes, or Types.
    *   The cards are Special Summoned face-down, even if "Gozen Match" / "Rivalry of Warlords" applies.
    *   If the Special Summoned cards have Trigger-like Effects that activate when destroyed (ex: "Black Pendant", "Geartown", "Supervise"), they can trigger when destroyed by battle. Cards like "Statue of the Wicked" & "Dark Coffin" must be destroyed while face-down (by card effect) in order to activate, they do not activate if flipped by an attack and destroyed by battle.
    *   If "Light of Intervention" is active, the cards are placed in face-up Defense Position.
    *   If "Gravekeeper's Servant" is Summoned and "Necrovalley" is active, it gains 500 ATK and DEF.
    *   After Special Summoning non-Monster Cards, if this effect would flip a Trap Monster (ex: "Zoma the Spirit") face-down, it returns to the Spell / Trap Card Zone and is not shuffled face-down with the Special Summoned non-Monster Cards. Once Set, it cannot activate that turn.
*   The Ⓒ Condition does not start a chain.
    *   This can cause Trigger-like Effects (ex: "Geartown", "Dark Coffin") to activate when destroyed.
    *   A card removed from play by "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" is destroyed when it is returns.

  
## MAGICAL MARIONETTE

*   There is no limit to the number of Spell Counters you can have on "Magical Marionette".
*   Removing Spell Counters from "Magical Marionette" to use its effect is a cost.
*   You can use "Magical Marionette"'s effect multiple times in the same turn, as long as you have enough Spell Counters to pay the cost.
*   You can destroy "Magical Marionette" with its own effect.
*   You place a Spell Counter on this card when the Spell Card resolves, so if "Magic Jammer" is used to negate the Spell Card's activation then you do not place a Spell Counter on this monster. But if "Imperial Order" is chained to the Spell Card, you still place a Spell Counter on this monster because the activation of the Spell Card was not negated. If the Spell Card was a Continuous, Equip, or Field Spell Card, and “Dust Tornado” is chained to its activation and destroys it before it resolves you still place a Spell Counter because the activation of the card was not negated.
*   If you activate a Spell Card, and your opponent chains "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Magical Marionette", "Magical Marionette" does not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card because "Magical Marionette" must be face-up on the field when the Spell Card is activated and when it resolves in order to get a Spell Counter.

  
## MAGICAL MERCHANT

*   You need to show the cards to your opponent, including the one you keep.
*   If you pick up your entire Deck and there were no Spell or Trap Cards, then "Magical Merchant"'s effect disappears.

  
## MAGICAL PLANT MANDRAGOLA

*   Includes your opponent's cards that are capable of having Spell Counters placed on them.

  
## MAGICAL SCIENTIST

*   You can use "Magical Scientist"'s effect multiple times in the same turn.
*   "Magical Scientist"'s effect does not target.
*   If the Fusion Monster is flipped face-down with "Book of Moon", or removed from play with "Dimensionhole" or "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" or "Different Dimension Gate", the effect is reset and the Fusion Monster does not go back to the Extra Deck, and is not prohibited from attacking your opponent's Life Points directly.
*   If you Special Summon "Reaper on the Nightmare" with "Magical Scientist", it cannot attack your opponent's Life Points directly (but can attack a monster).
*   You cannot activate "Secret Pass to the Treasures" targeting a Fusion Monster Special Summoned with "Magical Scientist" because it cannot attack your opponent's Life Points directly that turn.
*   If "Skill Drain" is activated after a Fusion Monster is Special Summoned with "Magical Scientist", the effect of "Magical Scientist" (that makes the Fusion Monster unable to attack directly and have to go back to the Extra Deck) has been applied already, and is not negated, so the Special Summoned Fusion Monster still cannot attack directly and must go back to the Extra Deck.
*   If "Jowgen the Spiritualist" is on the field, you cannot activate the effect of "Magical Scientist" (so you cannot even pay the cost to try and activate "Last Turn", for example).

  
## MAGICAL THORN

*   If you have two copies of "Magical Thorn" active on the field, your opponent will take 1000 points of damage whenever they discard a card. If you have three copies, they will take 1500 points of damage.
*   The effect of "Magical Thorn" is applied when the opponent discards during the End Phase to make their hand size 6, discarding for the cost of cards such as "Tribute to the Doomed", "Cost Down", or "Judgment of Anubis", and discarding for card effects such as "Delinquent Duo", "Confiscation", "Robbin’ Goblin", "Morphing Jar" and "Mefist the Infernal General".
*   The effect of "Magical Thorn" is NOT applied when you send cards from your hand to the Graveyard for things such as a Tribute for a Ritual Spell Card, a Fusion Material Monster, or the effects of cards like "Chosen One" or "Gravekeeper’s Watcher".
*   The effect of "Magical Thorn" is NOT applied when cards in your hand are destroyed by "Chain Destruction" or when cards are sent from the Deck to Graveyard by the effect of "Painful Choice". It is also NOT applied when cards in your hand are removed from play by the effect of "Lightforce Sword".
*   The effect of "Magical Thorn" is only applied when a card is discarded from your opponent’s hand to your opponent’s Graveyard. So if they have your card in your hand by the effect of "Exchange" or "Graverobber" and they discard it, they do not take any damage from the effect of "Magical Thorn".
*   If the opponent discards from their hand as a cost to activate a card like "Cost Down" and you chain "Magical Thorn" they will not take any damage. If your opponent activates a card where discarding is part of the effect of the card, such as "Card Destruction", and you chain "Magical Thorn", they WILL take damage because the effect of "Magical Thorn" will be active before the discarding effect resolves.
*   "Magical Thorn" deals damage per card, so if the opponent activates "Graceful Charity" they will take 1000 points of damage when they discard 2 cards. If they discard 5 cards to activate "Final Destiny" they take 2500 points of damage.
*   Even though "Magical Thorn" does damage per card discarded, it deals the damage as one lump sum for effects like "Dark Room of Nightmare".
*   "Necrovalley" does not negate the effect of "Magical Thorn".
*   The effect of "Magical Thorn" inflicts damage after an effect resolves. So if the effect of "Morphing Jar" is activated, the damage will be dealt after the new cards are drawn. This means if your opponent has 100 Life Points, and you have "Magical Thorn" active on the field but only one card left in your Deck, you will lose the Duel before the effect of "Magical Thorn" can deal damage to reduce your opponent’s Life Points to 0.
*   "Magical Thorn" will deal damage between steps in a chain. For example, both you and your opponent have 100 Life Points remaining, your opponent has two cards in their hand and you have "Magical Thorn" active on the field and a Set "Mind Crush". It is your opponent’s turn and they activate "Final Flame" to deal 600 points of damage to you, and you chain "Mind Crush" calling the "Sinister Serpent" you know they have in their hand. After Step 2 ("Mind Crush") resolves, the effect of "Magical Thorn" deals 500 points of damage to your opponent and you win the Duel before Step 1, "Final Flame", resolves.

  
## MAGICAT

*   This effect targets the Spell Card in your Graveyard.
*   When you Synchro Summon a Spellcaster-Type monster with “Urgent Tuning” that was activated as Chain Link 2 or higher using “Magicat” as a Synchro Material Monster, you can activate the effect to return a Spell Card in a new Chain after the first one resolves.
*   If “DNA Surgery” is changing monsters into Spellcasters and you use this card for a Synchro Summon, you can activate its effect.

  
## MAHARAGHI

*   If two copies of "Maharaghi" had their effects activated, you resolve them one at a time. This means you look at 1 card, and if you place it back on top of your Deck, you will see it again for the second effect.

  
## MAIDEN OF THE AQUA

*   The effect of "Maiden of the Aqua" is active only when there is no face-up Field Spell Card on the field. When a Field Spell Card is activated after "Maiden of the Aqua" is Summoned, the effect of "Maiden of the Aqua" is negated as long as there is a face-up Field Spell Card. If the only Field Spell Card is face-down, the effect of "Maiden of the Aqua" is active. If there is a face-up Field Spell Card but it is negated by "Imperial Order", the effect of "Maiden of the Aqua" is not active.
*   If a Field Spell Card is already active, and "Maiden of the Aqua" is Summoned, the existing Field Spell Card continues to function and "Maiden of the Aqua"’s effect is not applied until there is no face-up Field Spell Card.
*   While "Maiden of the Aqua" is making the field "Umi", you can activate "Tornado Wall" but if "Maiden of the Aqua" is destroyed, "Tornado Wall" is also destroyed.
*   If "Maiden of the Aqua", "Umi", and "Tornado Wall" are all on your side of the field, and "Umi" is destroyed, "Tornado Wall" is not destroyed because "Maiden of the Aqua" treats the field as "Umi" as soon as "Umi" leaves play.
*   If you have "Maiden of the Aqua" (with her effect active) and "The Legendary Fisherman" or "Deepsea Warrior" on your side of the field, and "Dark Hole" is activated, "The Legendary Fisherman" and "Deepsea Warrior" will not be destroyed.
*   If you have "Maiden of the Aqua" and "Tornado Wall" on the field, and "Maiden of the Aqua" is attacked by "Dark Driceratops" and Battle Damage would be inflicted, "Tornado Wall" still prevents the damage during damage calculation, as "Maiden of the Aqua" will remain on the field until the end of the Damage Step.

  
## MAJESTIC MECH - GORYU

*   Flipping “Majestic Mech – Ohka” or “Majestic Mech – Goryu” face-down will not reset their memory of how they were Summoned. So if you Normal Summoned them with fewer Tributes by using their effect, they will still be sent to the Graveyard by their effect during the End Phase even if they have been flipped face-down since being Summoned. (However, as long as they are face-down DURING the End Phase, their effect will not activate during that End Phase.)
*   The effect of “Majestic Mech – Ohka” and “Majestic Mech – Goryu” that sends itself to the Graveyard will activate during the End Phase of every turn (if they were Normal Summoned with fewer Tributes by using their effect).
*   If “Skill Drain” is active during the End Phase, it will negate the effects of a “Majestic Mech” so the “Majestic Mech” will not send itself to the Graveyard.
*   If you activate “Cost Down” and Normal Summon “Majestic Mech – Ohka” without Tributes (because it is Level 4) or “Majestic Mech – Goryu” with 1 Tribute (because it is Level 6), their effects will still activate during the End Phase and they will be sent to the Graveyard.
*   If you Tribute “Kaiser Sea Horse” to Normal Summon “Majestic Mech – Goryu” it is still only 1 monster being Tributed so its effect will activate during the End Phase and it will be sent to the Graveyard.
*   The effect of a “Majestic Mech” to send itself to the Graveyard is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to.

  
## MAJESTIC MECH - OHKA

*   Flipping “Majestic Mech – Ohka” or “Majestic Mech – Goryu” face-down will not reset their memory of how they were Summoned. So if you Normal Summoned them with fewer Tributes by using their effect, they will still be sent to the Graveyard by their effect during the End Phase even if they have been flipped face-down since being Summoned. (However, as long as they are face-down DURING the End Phase, their effect will not activate during that End Phase.)
*   The effect of “Majestic Mech – Ohka” and “Majestic Mech – Goryu” that sends itself to the Graveyard will activate during the End Phase of every turn (if they were Normal Summoned with fewer Tributes by using their effect).
*   If “Skill Drain” is active during the End Phase, it will negate the effects of a “Majestic Mech” so the “Majestic Mech” will not send itself to the Graveyard.
*   If you activate “Cost Down” and Normal Summon “Majestic Mech – Ohka” without Tributes (because it is Level 4) or “Majestic Mech – Goryu” with 1 Tribute (because it is Level 6), their effects will still activate during the End Phase and they will be sent to the Graveyard.
*   The effect of a “Majestic Mech” to send itself to the Graveyard is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to.

  
## MAJESTIC MECH - SENKU

*   If a “Majestic Mech” is face-down during the End Phase, its effect cannot activate so it will not be sent to the Graveyard. But it remembers when it was Summoned, even if flipped face-down. So if you Summon a “Majestic Mech - Senku”, flip it face-down, then flip it face-up again during the same turn, it will be sent to the Graveyard by its effect.
*   The effect of “Majestic Mech – Senku” that sends itself to the Graveyard only activates during the End Phase of the turn it was Summoned. If it manages to remain on the field longer than that, it will not send itself to the Graveyard during any following End Phase.
*   If “Skill Drain” is active during the End Phase, it will negate the effects of a “Majestic Mech” so the “Majestic Mech” will not send itself to the Graveyard.
*   The effect of a “Majestic Mech” to send itself to the Graveyard is a Trigger Effect that starts a chain.
*   “Majestic Mech – Senku’s” first effect is also a Trigger Effect that can be chained to.

  
## MAJI-GIRE PANDA

*   The effect of “Maji-Gire Panda” is a Trigger Effect that activates when 1 or more Beast-Type monster(s) are destroyed. If the monsters were destroyed as a result of battle, the timing of this effect is at the end of the Damage Step, when the monsters are sent to the Graveyard.
*   You can chain to the activation of “Maji-Gire Panda”’s effect, including with “Divine Wrath”.
*   If 2 or more Beast-Type monsters are destroyed at the same time, the ATK of “Maji-Gire Panda” only increases by 500 points.
*   Beast-Type tokens like “Sheep Tokens” are included and will increase the ATK of “Maji-Gire Panda” when destroyed.
*   Monsters changed to Beast-Type by “DNA Surgery” are included and will increase the ATK of “Maji-Gire Panda” when destroyed.
*   Beast-Type monsters on your opponent’s side of the field are included and will increase the ATK of “Maji-Gire Panda” when destroyed.
*   When face-down Beast-Type monsters are destroyed (by a card effect), the ATK of “Maji-Gire Panda” does not increase.
*   The ATK increase from the effect of “Maji-Gire Panda” remains as long as “Maji-Gire Panda” remains face-up on the field.

  
## MAJESTIC DRAGON

*   This card cannot be used as a Synchro Material Monster, except for the Synchro Summon of a "Majestic" monster.
*   The text of this card is not an effect. It cannot be negated by “Skill Drain.”

  
## MAJESTIC RED DRAGON

*   The effect that negates a monster’s effect and increases “Majestic Red Dragon’s” ATK targets that monster.
*   The effect that activates after damage calculation activates even if “Majestic Red Dragon” would be destroyed during damage calculation.
*   The effect that activates during the End Phase targets 1 “Red Dragon Archfiend” in your Graveyard.
*   The ATK gained by “Majestic Red Dragon” when you use its effect includes any bonuses the target monster is receiving from effects or Equip Spells.
*   If you target “Great Maju Garzett” with “Majestic Red Dragon’s” effect, “Great Maju Garzett’s” ATK becomes 0 and “Majestic Red Dragon” will not gain ATK.
*   You cannot target a non-Effect monster with “Majestic Red Dragon’s” effect.

  
## MAJESTIC STAR DRAGON

*   If you negate the effects of a monster with “Majestic Star Dragon” you can only activate 1 of the monster’s effects 1 time.
*   The effect to return “Majestic Star Dragon” to the Extra Deck is mandatory. It activates even if an effect that prohibits Special Summons is applied. In that case, you return “Majestic Star Dragon” to the Extra Deck but will not Special Summon “Stardust Dragon.”
*   If “G.B. Hunter” is on the field, the effect to return “Majestic Star Dragon” to the Extra Deck will activate and resolve without effect.
*   If you activate the effect of the monster that “Majestic Star Dragon” negated it will start a Chain. “Divine Wrath” can be used against this effect and will destroy “Majestic Star Dragon” in this case.
*   The effect to Special Summon “Stardust Dragon” targets the “Stardust Dragon.” It activates even if there is no “Stardust Dragon” in the Graveyard.
*   If you negate the effect of a monster and then take control of that monster with another effect, the monster’s effect is still negated.
*   If you negate your opponent’s “Majestic Star Dragon” with your own, you can activate the effect once again to negate another monster.
*   You cannot gain and activate the effect of a Gladiator Beast that returns to the Main Deck, but you can gain and activate the effect of a Gladiator Beast that returns to the Extra Deck.
*   If “Majestic Star Dragon” is destroyed by battle, it cannot activate the effects of monsters like “Hyper Hammerhead.”
*   If you negate “The Six Samurai – Yaichi” you cannot apply the effect to destroy another “Six Samurai” instead if “Majestic Star Dragon” would be destroyed.
*   If you negate “Morphtronic Celfon” you can only activate one of its effects, corresponding to the battle position of “Majestic Star Dragon.”
*   If you negate the effect of a Gemini monster that is being treated as a Normal Monster, you cannot activate its effect. If you negate the effect of a Gemini monster after it’s been Normal Summoned again, you cannot activate the negated effect because “Majestic Star Dragon” cannot be Summoned twice.
*   If you negate a card with an Ignition Effect like “Exiled Force” you can use its effect.
*   If you negate “Sangan” with “Majestic Star Dragon” you cannot activate its effect if “Majestic Star Dragon” is sent to the Graveyard.
*   You must pay all costs and meet all conditions required for the negated effect that you want to activate with “Majestic Star Dragon.”
*   You can only activate the negated effect during the turn you negated it with “Majestic Star Dragon.”
*   “Majestic Star Dragon” can activate effects that start a Chain. Ignition, Quick, and Trigger Effects can all be activated, but Continuous Effects that are always applied cannot be applied by “Majestic Star Dragon.”
*   If you negate “Sangan” with “Majestic Star Dragon” and then attack it, the effect of “Sangan” will activate and resolve normally.
*   “Majestic Star Dragon” cannot negate the effect of a monster whose effect is already being negated.
*   You can Tribute “Majestic Star Dragon” to negate an opponent’s card even if they control no cards to be destroyed.

*   You can Summon “Majestic Star Dragon” if “Majestic Dragon” is being treated as a non-Tuner and “Stardust Dragon” is being treated as a Tuner.

## MAJU GARZETT

*   You can't search for "Maju Garzett" with "Sangan" or "Mystic Tomato".
*   You can Tribute face-down monsters for "Maju Garzett" and their ATK will count towards "Maju Garzett"'s ATK.
*   "Maju Garzett"'s ATK will be 0 if you Special Summon it, or Tribute Summon it with a monster with "?" ATK (such as "Gradius' Option" or another "Maju Garzett"), or Tribute Summon it with only 1 Tribute using "Cost Down", or equip it with "Megamorph", or if it's flipped face-down and then face-up again, or if you Tribute Summon it with Mirage Tokens, or if you remove it from play with "Dimensionhole" and it returns to the field.
*   If "Skill Drain" is active, "Maju Garzett"'s ATK is reset to 0 even if "Skill Drain" is later destroyed.
*   If "Maju Garzett" battles "Cat's Ear Tribe", its original ATK is changed to 200 for the battle, then after the battle its ATK is reset to 0.

## MAKIU, THE MAGICAL MIST

*   “Makiu, the Magical Mist” targets the selected “Summoned Skull” or Thunder-Type monster. The destruction effect of “Makiu, the Magical Mist” does not target, so it will not destroy “Abyssal Kingshark”, etc. You cannot select a face-down monster because you cannot check its ATK. You cannot activate “Makiu, the Magical Mist” during Main Phase 2. You can activate “Makiu, the Magical Mist” and “Soul Exchange” during the same turn. Likewise, you can activate more than 1 copy of “Makiu, the Magical Mist” and/or “Soul Exchange” during the same turn.

*   You cannot activate a "Raigeki Break" in your hand by discard "Makyura the Destructor" as a cost.

  
## MALEVOLENT MECH - GOKU EN  
> Ⓤ You can Normal Summon this card without Tributing. ① If you do, this card is sent to the Graveyard during the End Phase if it is the only Zombie-Type monster on the field. When it is sent to the Graveyard by this effect, you take damage equal to its ATK.

*   The Ⓤ Unclassified Effect does not activate, it applies in the hand.
*   The ① Trigger Effect is mandatory, it activates & resolves on the field in the End Phase.
    *   This effect ONLY activates & resolve is if it is the ONLY Zombie-Type monster on the field.
    *   This effect will activate during the End Phase of every turn (if this card was Normal Summoned with its \[U\] Unclassified Effect).
    *   If the activation of this effect is negated by "Light and Darkness Dragon", it will activate again in the same End Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
    *   If this effect resolves negated by "Skill Drain", it will not activate again in the same End Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
    *   This effect resolves without effect (Goku En is not destroyed) if an effect (like "Call of the Haunted") is chained that Summons an another Zombie-Type monster to the field face-up.
    *   This effect resolves sequentially: first, send this card to the Graveyard; then inflict effect damage.
    *   This effect inflicts damage equal to the original (printed) ATK of "Malevolent Mech - Goku En".
*   VS. "Creature Swap": If this card (Normal Summoned by its \[U\] Unclassified Effect) changes control and activates its effect in the End Phase, the controller of Goku En on the field (when it was destroyed) takes the damage \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=759277), [REF2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=764678)\].

  
## MALEVOLENT NUZZLER

*   If a "Sangan" or a "Witch of the Black Forest" equipped with "Malevolent Nuzzler" is Tributed and you activate the effect of "Malevolent Nuzzler", "Malevolent Nuzzler" goes on top of your Deck and then "Sangan" or "Witch of the Black Forest" is resolved. If "Sangan" is destroyed (not Tributed) the effects of "Sangan" and "Malevolent Nuzzler" are simultaneous and form a chain.

  
## MALICE ASCENDANT

*   The number of “Malice Ascendants” in your Graveyard is counted at the resolution of its effect. If your opponent chains “Disappear” to remove 1, then it is no longer counted for the effect of your “Malice Ascendant” on the field.

  
## MALICE DOLL OF DEMISE

*   If your opponent takes control of your "Malice Doll of Demise", and sends it to the Graveyard by the effect of a Continuous Spell Card, you can still activate its effect to Special Summon it during your Standby Phase.
*   If "Malice Doll of Demise" is Tributed to activate the effect of "Mass Driver", then "Malice Doll of Demise’s" effect does not activate because the Tribute is treated as a cost, not an effect.
*   Examples of Continuous Spell Cards that would send "Malice Doll of Demise" from the field to the Graveyard by their effect include "Ectoplasmer" and "Continuous Destruction Punch".
*   You can only activate the Special Summoning effect of “Malice Doll of Demise” during your first Standby Phase after it was sent to the Graveyard by the effect of a Continuous Spell Card. If you miss that, you cannot then activate the Special Summoning effect later on. If there is no monster card zone at the appropriate time, the effect is activated but you cannot Special Summon the “Malice Doll of Demise”, so its effect disappears.
*   The effect of "Malice Doll of Demise" activates in the Graveyard. If "The End of Anubis" is on the field during the Standby Phase in which "Malice Doll of Demise" would activate its effect, then the effect is negated and "Malice Doll of Demise" is not Special Summoned. If "The End of Anubis" leaves play after that, you still cannot activate "Malice Doll of Demise"’s effect because the opportunity has passed.

  
## MAN BEAST OF ARES

*   If “Man Beast of Ares” gains ATK, but then “Skill Drain” is activated, the ATK increase is wiped out. Even if “Skill Drain” is later destroyed, the ATK increase is not restored. (Although new ATK can be gained.)

  
## MAN-EATER BUG

*   If "Man-Eater Bug" is the only monster on the field when it is flipped, it destroys itself.

  
## MANTICORE OF DARKNESS

*   "Manticore of Darkness"' effect can be activated during the End Phase when it was sent to the Graveyard from the field, hand, or your Deck that same turn.
*   When you send 1 "Manticore of Darkness" to the Graveyard to Special Summon another "Manticore of Darkness", you can then send the new "Manticore of Darkness" to the Graveyard to Special Summon the first "Manticore of Darkness".
*   If "Card of Safe Return" is active, and "Manticore of Darkness" is Special Summoned with its effect, you can draw a card. So with 2 "Manticores of Darkness", 1 of them sent to the Graveyard, and "Card of Safe Return" in play, you can draw as many cards as you want.
*   When "Manticore of Darkness" is sent to the Graveyard because of hand size adjustment in the End Phase, you can activate its effect.
*   You can send a face-down Beast, Beast-Warrior, or Winged Beast-Type monster to the Graveyard for "Manticore of Darkness"' effect.
*   Sending monsters to the Graveyard for "Manticore of Darkness"' effect is a cost.
*   You can't send a Monster Token to the Graveyard for "Manticore of Darkness"' effect because Monster Tokens are taken off the field instead of going to the Graveyard.
*   The owner of "Manticore of Darkness" gets the effect, so if your opponent controls your "Manticore of Darkness" and it's sent to the Graveyard, you get to activate the effect.

  
## MARAUDING CAPTAIN

*   If you have 2 "Maurading Captains" on your side of the field, the opponent cannot attack any face-up Warrior-Type monsters you control. They can attack your Life Points directly if they control a monster with an effect that allows it (Such as "Rainbow Flower", "Inaba White Rabbit", or a Toon Monster). They could also attack a non-Warrior Type monster you control.
*   Your opponent can attack face-down monsters while you have "Maurading Captain" on the field, even if the face-down monster is Warrior-Type.
*   If you control "Maurading Captain" and a Warrior-Type monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", the opponent must attack the monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" if they choose to attack.
*   If you control 2 "Maurading Captains" and one of them is equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", your opponent cannot attack either one.
*   If you control "Patrician of Darkness", "Maurading Captain" and a Warrior-Type monster when your opponent attacks, you can use the effect of "Patrician of Darkness" to redirect the attack to "Patrician of Darkness" or "Maurading Captain" only. Not to the other Warrior-Type monster because it cannot be attacked.
*   The monster Special Summoned by the effect of "Maurading Captain" does NOT have to be a Warrior-Type monster.
*   If your opponent activates "Torrential Tribute" in response to the Summoning of "Maurading Captain" (by chaining to the Trigger Effect of "Marauding Captain"), all monsters on the field will be destroyed, and then you Special Summon for "Maurading Captain"’s effect. If they wait and activate "Torrential Tribute" in response to the Special Summoning of a monster for the effect of "Marauding Captain", then all monsters will be destroyed including the newly-Special Summoned monster.

  
## MARIONETTE MITE

*   This is an Ignition Effect activated from your hand.

*   If “DNA Surgery” is chained to this effect, so that the target’s Type changes before this effect resolves, then the effect is not applied.
*   If “DNA Surgery” is activated later in the turn, after this effect has already resolved, it has no effect on the resolution of this effect. (Control does not instantly change back. Control changes back as normal at the end of the turn.)

    *   If the equipped monster is flipped face-down, it remains on its current controller's side of the field.
    *   If the equipped monster is briefly banished by "Interdimensional Matter Transporter", "Mark of the Rose" is destroyed by game mechanic, the monster returns to the field and won't change control.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger-like Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect differs with contemporary errata of "Mark of the Rose".
*   The ③ mandatory Trigger-like Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect is not present on contemporary errata of "Mark of the Rose".

> Konami policy regarding card legality and cards with [erratas](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Errata) (section IX. subsection G. of the [policy document](https://img.yugioh-card.com/en/gameplay/penalty_guide/YGOTCG_Policy_v_2_1.pdf)) state that "you are required to play all copies of your cards according to the most recent text".

    *   This card can still be destroyed by card effects, like that of “Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke”.
    *   If a face-down “Marshmallon” attacked while “Gorgon’s Eye” applies will have its effects negated.

  
## MARSHMALLON GLASSES

*   While you have “Marshmallon” and “Marshmallon Glasses” face-up on your side of the field, if you equip a monster, other than “Marshmallon”, on your side of the field with “Ring of Magnetism”, your opponent’s monsters must attack the monster equipped with “Ring of Magnetism” when they attack.
*   While you have “Marshmallon” and “Marshmallon Glasses” face-up on your side of the field, if you activate “Staunch Defender” and select a monster other than “Marshmallon”, your opponent’s monsters must attack the monster you selected with “Staunch Defender”.
*   While you have “Marshmallon”, “Marshmallon Glasses”, and “Marauding Captain” face-up on your side of the field and you activate “DNA Surgery”, selecting Warrior-Type, your opponent will not be able to attack with their monsters.
*   While you have “Marshmallon”, “Marshmallon Glasses”, and “Magician’s Valkyria” face-up on your side of the field and you activate “DNA Surgery”, selecting Spellcaster-Type, your opponent will not be able to attack with their monsters.
*   While you control a face-down “Marshmallon” and a face-up “Marshmallon Glasses”, if your opponent declares an attack against a monster other than “Marshmallon” and you activate “Ceasefire”, your opponent’s monster will still attack its original intended target because the attack has already been declared.
*   While you have a face-up “Marshmallon”, “Marshmallon Glasses”, and another monster equipped with “Raregold Armor”, your opponent cannot attack with any of their monsters.
*   “Marshmallon Glasses” can be activated while “Marshmallon” is face-down or not on the field.
*   While you have “Marshmallon” and “Marshmallon Glasses” face-up on your side of the field, your opponent cannot attack directly with cards like “Goblin Black Ops” or “Inaba White Rabbit”. Your opponent must select “Marshmallon” when declaring their attack.

  
## MARYOKUTAI

*   This monster’s effect is a Quick Effect, and therefore Spell Speed 2. So it may be used against Quick-Play Spell Cards.
*   You can Tribute "Maryokutai" to activate its effect during the Damage Step.

  
## MASK OF BRUTALITY

*   The payment of 1000 Life Points is optional and the controller of "Mask of Brutality", not the controller of the equipped monster, chooses to pay or not. If you choose not to pay 1000 Life Points, "Mask of Brutality" is destroyed.

  
## MASK OF RESTRICT  
> Monsters cannot be Tributed.

*   If a card / effect Tributes a monster(s) as part of a cost / effect, it cannot be activated.
*   If this card is Chained to a card whose effect would Tribute a monster(s), no monster(s) is Tributed.
*   If this card is Chained to a card / effect (such as "Cannon Soldier") that Tributed a monster(s) as cost, that effect still resolves since the activation cost was already paid.
*   If this card is Chained to a Ritual Spell Card, it cannot Tribute monsters when it resolves, but it can still remove from play the "Djinn" monsters if their Levels would allow the Ritual Summon to be performed.
*   Fusion and Synchro Summons can still be performed, as the Material are not Tributed.

  
## MASKED SORCERER

*   The effect of "Masked Sorcerer" includes Battle Damage caused when it is attacked in Defense Position by a monster with ATK lower than "Masked Sorcerer"’s DEF.

  
## MASS DRIVER

*   Tributing a monster for "Mass Driver" is a cost.
*   You can use "Mass Driver"'s effect repeatedly in the same turn as long as you can keep paying the cost.
*   The activation of "Mass Driver"'s effect can be chained to.

  
## MASS HYPNOSIS

*   You can only select as many monsters with A-Counters as you have empty Monster Card Zones.
*   If a monster you control with the effect of "Mass Hypnosis" loses it’s A-Counter, then control is returned to the opponent.
*   If a monster you control with the effect of "Mass Hypnosis" is flipped face-down, then you will keep continue to control it, even though it no longer has A-Counters and even if "Mass Hypnosis" is removed from the field.

  
## MASTER GIG

*   Paying 1000 Life Points is a cost to activate “Master Gig’s” effect. This effect does not target.
*   You determine the number of destroyed monsters based on the number of face-up Psychic monsters you control when this effect resolves.
*   If the number of monsters controlled by the opponent is less than the number of face-up Psychic monsters you control, you cannot activate “Master Gig’s” effect. If the effect has already been activated and you control more Psychic-Type monsters than your opponent has monsters when the effect resolves, you cannot destroy any of the opponent’s monsters.

  
## MATAZA THE ZAPPER

*   You cannot use "Change of Heart" on a face-up "Mataza the Zapper".
*   If you take control of a face-down "Mataza the Zapper" and flip it face-up, it stays on your side of the field and doesn't return to the original controller.

> ① Both players can Normal Summon or Set monsters without Tributing, by paying 1000 Life Points x the number of monsters needed for the Tribute Summon.

*   The ① Ignition-like Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Either player can use this effect on their respective turn.
    *   This effect is not an additional Normal Summon, but your one Normal / Tribute Summon for the turn may be performed without Tributing monsters.
    *   Paying 1000 or 2000 Life Points is a cost.
    *   You cannot pay 3000 Life Points to Normal Summon "Victory Dragon" or "Gilford the Lightning", so you cannot use this effect to Normal Summon "Obelisk the Tormentor" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=814931)\].
    *   The Normal Summoned monster (ex: "Caius the Shadow Monarch") was NOT Tribute Summoned.
    *   The Normal Summon CANNOT be negated by "Solemn Judgment" \[[REF](https://www.edisonformat.com/home/rules-update-when-not-immediately-after-this-effect-resolves)\].
    *   The Normal Summon can be responded to with "Torrential Tribute".
    *   You cannot use the effect of "Spell Economics" to activate this effect without paying Life Points.
    *   This effect cannot be used when resolving the effect of “Ultimate Offering”, because you cannot activate “Mausoleum of the Emperor’s” effect during the resolution of “Ultimate Offering’s” effect.

  
## MAX WARRIOR

*   The effect to change the Level and halve the ATK/DEF of this card is a Trigger Effect that activates at the end of the Damage Step.
*   If “Max Warrior” has its Level and ATK/DEF changed by its own effect and your next Standby Phase is skipped, the Level and ATK/DEF of “Max Warrior” will return to normal at the start of Main Phase 1.
*   If you use the effect of “Assault Armor” to let “Max Warrior” attack twice and destroy two monsters, its Level will be 2 and its original ATK/DEF will be ¼ of their printed value.
*   You choose when during your Standby Phase to return “Max Warrior’s” Level and original ATK/DEF to normal. It does not start a chain.
*   The halved ATK/DEF is considered the original ATK/DEF while “Max Warrior’s” effect is being applied.

  
## MAZERA DEVILLE

*   You cannot use "Monster Reborn", etc. on "Mazera DeVille" even if he is Special Summoned properly, because he "cannot be Special Summoned, EXCEPT by...".
*   If you Special Summon "Mazera DeVille", his effect activates, and your opponent chains "Mystical Space Typhoon" to destroy "Pandemonium" in a chain, "Mazera Deville"'s effect disappears because his effect needs "Pandemonium" on the field when the effect resolves, not just when it activates (just like "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn").
*   If your opponent has less than 3 cards in his hand, he must discard his entire hand.

  
## MECHA BUNNY

*   "Mecha Bunny"'s effect targets 1 card on the field. If an effect is chained that removes the selected card from the field, "Mecha Bunny"'s effect disappears.

  
## MECHA-DOG MARRON

*   If “Mecha-Dog Marron” is destroyed in the middle of a chain, its effect starts a new chain when the current chain has finished resolving.
*   You can use “Barrel Behind the Door” against either effect of “Mecha-Dog Marron”.

  
## MECHANICAL HOUND

*   “Activate” means make the card face-up, or activate it from your hand. If “Mechanical Hound” is face-up on the field, your opponent can still use the effects of Continuous Spell Cards that are already face-up on the field.

  
## MEDIUM PIECE GOLEM

*   If "Medium Piece Golem" is Special Summoned during the Damage Step, you can activate its effect.

  
## MEGA TON MAGICAL CANNON

*   Removing Spell Counters is a cost. If you do not have 10 Spell Counters you cannot activate "Mega-Ton Magical Cannon".

  
## MEGAMORPH

*   "Megamorph" changes the current ATK of the monster it is equipped to. It calculates a new current ATK by half or doubling the equipped monster’s original ATK.
*   Having multiple "Megamorphs" equipped to a monster is the same as having one.
*   "Megamorph" is always recalculating with every change in Life Points. For example, your "Jirai Gumo" is equipped with "Megamorph" and you have 8000 Life Points compared to your 7000. You declare an attack with "Jirai Gumo" and lose the coin toss, losing 4000 Life Points. Now "Jirai Gumo"’s ATK is doubled before Damage Calculation.
*   When Life Points are equal the equipped monster’s ATK is unchanged.
*   You may equip "Megamorph" to your opponent’s monster, but ‘your Life Points’ refers to the controller of "Megamorph". So if you have more Life Points than your opponent, your opponent’s monster equipped with "Megamorph" has its ATK halved.

  
## MEGAROCK DRAGON

*   You must remove from play at least 1 Rock-Type monster in your Graveyard in order to Special Summon “Megarock Dragon”.
*   If you Special Summon “Mega-Rock Dragon” with an original ATK of 2100 points, and you equip it with “Megamorph”, its current ATK will become 4200 or 1050 depending on your Life Points.
*   If “Skill Drain” is active while “Megarock Dragon” is in play, the effect of “Megarock Dragon” is negated and its original ATK and DEF are treated as zero. Even if “Skill Drain” is destroyed later, the original ATK and DEF of “Megarock Dragon” will remain zero.
*   If “Megarock Dragon” is flipped face-down, or removed from play, or sent to the Graveyard, its effect is wiped and its original ATK and DEF are zero.

  
## MEMORY CRUSHER

*   “Memory Crusher’s” effect activates when battle damage is inflicted.

  
## MERMAID ARCHER

*   “Mermaid Archer’s” effect to equip itself targets the Level 3 or lower monster you control.
*   If “Imperial Order” or “Spell Canceller” are active, “Mermaid Archer” still gains the 800 ATK from a monster equipped to it.
*   If “Mermaid Archer” and the monster equipped to it would be destroyed at the same time (by “Judgment Dragon,” for example), you cannot destroy the equipped monster to save “Mermaid Archer.”
*   Only monsters equipped to “Mermaid Archer” by “Mermaid Archer’s” own effect can be destroyed instead of “Mermaid Archer.”
*   If “Mermaid Archer” is equipped with a monster by its own effect, and also equipped with “Metallizing Parasite – Lunatite” at the same time, and it would be destroyed, “Metallizing Parasite – Lunatite” automatically destroys itself with its effect, so you cannot choose to destroy the other monster equipped to “Mermaid Archer.”

  
## MERMAID KNIGHT

*   "Mermaid Knight" can attack twice if "Maiden of the Aqua" is making the field treated as "Umi".
*   If you declare your second attack with "Mermaid Knight", and "Umi" is destroyed during the Battle Step, a replay occurs and you cannot attack a second time with "Mermaid Knight".
*   If there is no "Umi" on the field and "Mermaid Knight" attacks, then you Special Summon "Maiden of the Aqua" to treat the field as "Umi", you can attack a second time.

  
## MESSENGER OF PEACE

*   The maintenance cost is optional, you may chose not to play 100 Life Points and "Messenger of Peace" will be destroyed.
*   The ATK of an attacking monster may increase above 1500 after the attack is declared.

  
## METAL REFLECT SLIME

*   You can select "Metal Reflect Slime" with "Last Turn" and it will not be sent to the Graveyard.
*   A "Metal Reflect Slime" equipped with "Heart of Clear Water" will be destroyed by "Mystical Space Typhoon".
*   You cannot activate "A Deal with Dark Ruler" when "Metal Reflect Slime" is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard because it is a Trap Card in the Graveyard.
*   While "Metal Reflect Slime" is treated as an Effect Monster Card, it will count as 1 card for "Spatial Collapse".
*   When "Inferno" destroys "Metal Reflect Slime" in battle, its effect does not activate.
*   You can activate "Chain Disappearance" when "Metal Reflect Slime" is Special Summoned. The Special Summoned "Metal Reflect Slime" and all copies of "Metal Reflect Slime" in the Deck will be removed from play.
*   When "Absorbing Kid from the Sky" destroys "Metal Reflect Slime" in battle, its effect does not activate because "Metal Reflect Slime" is a Trap Card in the Graveyard.
*   When you activate "Call of the Earthbound" and chain "Metal Reflect Slime", a replay will occur when "Metal Reflect Slime" is Special Summoned. If the opponent decides to attack with the same monster, you will select its attack target.
*   If "Metal Reflect Slime" becomes a Machine-Type Monster with "DNA Surgery", you can select it with "Machine Duplication" but you will not be able to Special Summon any cards because "Metal Reflect Slime" is a Trap Card while in your Deck.

  
## METALLIZING PARASITE - LUNATITE  
> ① Once per turn, during your Main Phase, if you control this monster on the field, you can equip it to a face-up monster on your side of the field as an Equip Card, OR unequip the Union equipment and Special Summon this card in face-up Attack Position. ② While equipped to a monster by this card's effect, that monster will be unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards controlled by your opponent. Ⓒ (1 monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the monster that this card is equipped to is destroyed as a result of battle, destroy this card instead.)

*   While "Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite" is equipped to a monster, and "Final Destiny" is activated, all monsters are destroyed except for the monster equipped with "Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite".
*   If you equip "Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite" to a monster that has been affected by "Limiter Removal", the monster is still destroyed during the End Phase by "Limiter Removal"'s effect.

  
## METALMORPH

*   If you equip a monster with 2 or more copies of “Metalmorph”, the effect of each copy of “Metalmorph” is applied. For example, if you equip 2 “Metalmorph” onto a monster it will gain 600 ATK and DEF and when the equipped monster attacks your opponent’s monster its ATK will be increased further by the effect of each “Metalmorph”.
*   If “Reverse Trap” is activated, the increase of 300 ATK and DEF is changed into a decrease of 300 ATK and DEF. When your monster that is equipped with “Metalmorph” attacks your opponent’s monster, the additional gained ATK, that is based on the ATK of the monster being attacked, is NOT changed to a decrease.
*   The additional ATK gained when your equipped monster attacks your opponent’s monster is applied when you attack a face-up or face-down monster. This effect does not target.
*   If you have a Warrior-Type monster equipped with “Metalmorph” and it attacks your opponent’s “Kinetic Soldier”, the effect of “Kinetic Soldier” is resolved first. The monster equipped with “Metalmorph” will gain ATK equal to half of “Kinetic Soldier’s” total ATK.
*   If your monster that is equipped with “Metalmorph” attacks your opponent’s “Injection Fairy Lily”, if your opponent activates “Injection Fairy Lily’s” effect it will be resolved first, and then after “Injection Fairy Lily’s” ATK is increased by 3000 your monster will gain additional ATK equal to half of “Injection Fairy Lily’s” total ATK.
*   If your monster that is equipped with “Metalmorph” attacks your opponent’s “Elemental Hero Wildheart”, your monster will still gain additional ATK because “Metalmorph” does not affect the monster that is being attacked.
*   When you monster that is equipped with “Metalmorph” attacks your opponent’s “The Wicked Avatar”, first you will apply the additional gained ATK based on the current ATK of “The Wicked Avatar”, and then if your equipped monster becomes the monster with the highest ATK on the field, the ATK of “The Wicked Avatar” will be recalculated.
    *   Example: Player A has “Cannon Soldier” equipped with “Metalmorph” (1400 + 300 = 1700 ATK). “Cannon Soldier” is the monster with the highest ATK on the field, so “The Wicked Avatar” has 1800 ATK (1700 + 100 = 1800 ATK). When “Cannon Soldier” attacks “The Wicked Avatar”, the additional ATK is applied, giving “Cannon Soldier” a total of 2600 ATK (1800/2 + 1700 = 2600). “The Wicked Avatar’s” ATK is then recalculated to 2700 (2600 + 100 = 2700) and damage is calculated. Player A’s “Cannon Soldier” is destroyed and Player A takes 100 points of Battle Damage.

  
## METALSILVER ARMOR

*   Your opponent cannot activate "Monster Reborn" and other cards that target while you have a monster equipped with "Metalsilver Armor". Your opponent can activate "Raigeki", "Mirror Force", and other cards that do not target.
*   If you attack with "Dark Magician", and you control another monster equipped with "Metalsilver Armor", your opponent cannot activate "Magic Cylinder" because "Magic Cylinder" targets and only the monster equipped with "Metalsilver Armor" can be targeted (and it is not attacking).
*   If you have "Metalsilver Armor" active, your opponent cannot target his/her monsters either (with Equip Spell Cards, etc.), including with "Premature Burial".
*   If you have 2 monsters equipped with "Metalsilver Armor", your opponent cannot activate any effects that target 1 monster.
*   When you have a monster equipped with "Metalsilver Armor", your opponent CAN activate the effect of "Nimble Momonga" or "Giant Germ" because their effects do not target 1 card.
*   When you have a monster equipped with "Metalsilver Armor", your opponent CAN activate "Reinforcement of the Army".
*   When you have a monster equipped with "Metalsilver Armor", your opponent CAN activate the effect of "The Thing in the Crater" because it Special Summons a monster from your HAND.

  
## METAMORPHOSIS

*   "Metamorphosis" does not properly Summon a Fusion Monster, so you cannot use "Monster Reborn" on it afterwards.
*   Tributing a monster is a cost.
*   You can Tribute a face-down monster.
*   If you activated “Soul Exchange” targeting your opponent’s monster, if the monster is face-down, you cannot Tribute it as a cost for “Metamorphosis”.
*   You can Tribute a Monster Token (including a Sheep Token from "Scapegoat").
*   If there is no Fusion Monster with the same level as the Tributed monster in your Extra Deck, then you cannot activate this card.
*   "Metamorphosis" vs. "A Legendary Ocean": if you want to Special Summon a Level 6 Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, you have to Tribute a Level 7 WATER monster on the field because it is treated as a Level 6.

  
## METAPHYSICAL REGENERATION  
This card's name has been changed to “SUPERNATURAL REGENERATION".

*   You count Psychic monsters sent to any Graveyard, including your opponent’s.
*   “Zombie World” will change all Psychic monsters into Zombies, including in the Graveyard, so any Psychic monsters sent to the Graveyard will be Zombies instead, and will not count for “Metaphysical Regeneration” (in fact, you cannot activate
*   “Metaphysical Regeneration” in that case). Effects that change Type on the field, like “DNA Surgery”, will not apply in the Graveyard, so Psychic monsters sent to the Graveyard while “DNA Surgery” is active still count as “Psychic-Type monsters sent to the Graveyard this turn” (so you gain Life Points for them). Returning Psychic monsters to the Graveyard (with “Miracle Dig”, etc.) does not count as “sending” them to the Graveyard, so they do not count for “Metaphysical Regeneration”. Even if Psychic monsters sent to the Graveyard are no longer in the Graveyard during the End Phase, they still can count for “Metaphysical Regeneration”.

  
## METEOR FLARE

*   Sending 2 cards from your hand to the Graveyard is a cost.
*   If your opponent’s Life Points drop to 3000 or lower before this effect resolves you will still inflict 2000 damage to them.
*   The effect of “Meteor Flare” that activates in your Graveyard is Spell Speed 2.

  
## METEOR OF DESTRUCTION

*   If you activate “Meteor of Destruction”, and an effect is chained that causes your opponent’s Life Points to fall below 3000, “Meteor of Destruction” was already activated properly, so it resolves as normal.

  
## METEORAIN

*   You can activate "Meteorain" during your turn at any point from the Draw Phase to the end of your Battle Phase; you cannot activate it during the Damage Step, Main Phase 2, your End Phase, or your opponent's turn.
*   "Meteorain"'s effect applies to all your monsters. Monsters that you Summon, Flip Summon, Special Summon, etc. after activating "Meteorain" still get its effect.
*   When you attack with a monster that has "Meteorain"'s bonus, and you attack a Defense Position "Amazoness Swordswoman", then you will take the Battle Damage to your Life Points.

  
## MEZUKI  
> ① You can remove from play this card from your Graveyard to Special Summon 1 Zombie-Type monster from your Graveyard.

*   The ① Ignition Effect can only activate it during your Main Phase.
    *   This card removes itself from play as a cost.
    *   This effect targets 1 Zombie-Type monster in your Graveyard.
    *   If the target is no longer a Zombie-Type monster, it is not Special Summoned.
*   If "Ancient Gear Beast" destroys this card by battle, you can activate this effect but it resolves negated.

  
## MICRO RAY

*   You select the monster when you activate "Micro Ray".
*   If you apply "Micro Ray"'s effect and then a new card increases the DEF, add the new DEF to the zero.
*   You can activate "Micro Ray" during the Damage Step.

  
## MID SHIELD GARDNA

*   The first effect of “Mid-Shield Gardna” is an Ignition Effect. The second is a Trigger Effect. You can chain to these effects. You can activate “Divine Wrath” against these effects.

  
## MILLENNIUM SCORPION

*   The effect of “Millennium Scorpion” is a Trigger Effect. Each time it destroys a monster on your opponent’s side of the field and sends it to the Graveyard as a result of battle, it activates. This effect can be chained to. You can activate “Divine Wrath” against it.
*   If “Millennium Scorpion” attacks and destroys a Monster Token, the effect of “Millennium Scorpion” does not activate because a Monster Token isn’t sent to the Graveyard.
*   If “Millennium Scorpion” has an ATK boost from its effect, but is removed from play with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, or flipped face-down, the effect is reset and its ATK returns to normal.

  
## MINAR

*   If the summoning of "Minar" is negated by "Solemn Judgment", etc. its effect is not activated, as it is not considered to have gone directly from your hand to the Graveyard.

  
## MIND CONTROL  
> Take control of 1 monster your opponent controls until the End Phase. It cannot declare an attack or be Tributed.

*   This effect targets 1 (face-up / face-down) monster your opponent controls.  
    
*   If the targeted monster was Special Summoned this turn (by "Call of the Haunted"), you can change its Battle Position when you gain control of it \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=1127248)\].  
    
*   Control of the target changes even if it isflipped face-up / face-down before "Mind Control" resolves.  
    
*   The effect "it cannot declare an attack or be Tributed" is an effect that is applied until the End Phase of the turn "Mind Control" is applied.
*   The target can be used as a Synchro Material Monster or a Fusion Material Monster.
*   The target can be removed from play / sent to the Graveyard / returned to the Deck for a cost / effect.
*   Returningcontrol of the monster in the End Phase does not start a chain, this occurs even if the monster was flipped face-up / face-down.  
    
*   A card with an effect of "Control of this face-up card on the field cannot switch" cannot switch control while face-up under any circumstances. So, if a face-down Botanical Lion changes control due to Mind Control and is then flipped face-up, the lingering part of the effect of Mind Control will not apply during the End Phase and control of Botanical Lion will not return to the original owner.

  
## MIND CRUSH  
> ① Declare 1 card name. If that card is in your opponent's hand, they must discard all copies of it from their hand. If it is not, you randomly discard 1 card.

*   You CANNOT activate "Mind Crush" while either player has no cards in hand.
    *   This effect resolves even if you no longer have any cards in hand.
*   Declare a card's original (printed) name at activation.
*   If the opponent discards the named card, they do not reveal their hand to verify \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=822229)\].
*   If the opponent doesn't discard the named card, they reveal their hand to verify UNLESS:
    *   1 copy of a named Limited Card is accounted for (field / Graveyard / banished) \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=822229)\].
    *   2 copies of a named Semi-Limited Card are accounted for (field / Graveyard / banished) \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=822229)\].
    *   3 copies of a named Unlimited Card are accounted for (field / Graveyard / banished) \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=822229)\].

  
## MIND MASTER

*   Paying 800 Life Points and Tributing 1 other Psychic-Type monster is a cost.
*   You can activate this effect multiple times during the same turn if you can continue to pay the cost.
*   "Mind Master"'s effect cannot be activated if you do not have any Level 4 or lower Psychic-Type Monsters in your Deck that you can Special Summon.

  
## MIND ON AIR

*   "Mind on Air"’s effect is continuous, so if you Summon "Mind on Air" and your opponent responds with "Trap Hole", your opponent must show their hand until "Mind on Air" is no longer on the field (after "Trap Hole" resolves).
*   If "Mind on Air" is causing your opponent’s hand to be revealed, and an effect that randomly selects a card is activated (like "Robbin’ Goblin"), your opponent shuffles their hand and you must choose randomly without seeing the fronts of the cards.

  
## MIND OVER MATTER

*   You can Tribute a face-down Psychic-Type monster you control.

  
## MIND PROTECTOR

*   Paying 500 Life Points is a maintenance cost.

  
## MIND TRUST

*   You can Tribute a face-down monster to pay the cost of “Mind Trust.” This effect targets 1 Tuner in your Graveyard.
*   Calculate the appropriate Level based on the Tributed monster’s Level as it was on the field.
*   Round down. If you Tribute a Level 5 monster (for example) you can add a Level 1 or 2 Tuner to your hand, but not a Level 3.

  
## MINE GOLEM

*   The effect of “Mine Golem” is a Trigger Effect that activates when “Mine Golem” is sent to the Graveyard after having been destroyed as a result of battle. It can be chained to.

  
## MINEFIELD ERUPTION

*   If you activate “Minefield Eruption”, you inflict damage, then send your “Mine Golem”(s) to the Graveyard. So your opponent has missed the timing and cannot activate “Numinous Healer”, etc.
*   The number of “Mine Golem” cards is considered when “Minefield Eruption” resolves, not when it is activated.

  
## MIRACLE FERTILIZER

*   "Miracle Fertilizer" targets the monster(s) Special Summoned by its effect, both when it is selected in the Graveyard and while it is on the field. If "Miracle Fertilizer" is returned to its owner's hand, any monster(s) that was Special Summoned by its effect is no longer targeted, even if "Miracle Fertilizer" is activated again later.
*   If you Special Summon a monster with "Miracle Fertilizer", and later in the same turn "Miracle Fertilizer" is removed from the field, you still cannot Normal Summon or Set a monster that turn.
*   If you Special Summon 2 or more monsters with "Miracle Fertilizer", when any of the Special Summoned monsters is removed from the field, "Miracle Fertilizer" is destroyed.
*   If you activate the effect of "Miracle Fertilizer" and an effect is chained that removes the targeted Plant-Type monster from play, you can still Normal Summon or Set during that turn.

  
## MIRACLE FLIPPER

*   If "Miracle Flipper" is destroyed by a Spell or Trap Card while face-down, its effect to destroy 1 monster activates. This effect targets the monster to be destroyed.
*   If you have a "Miracle Flipper" face-up on your side of the field, you cannot Special Summon another copy of "Miracle Flipper" with "Monster Reborn" or "The Shallow Grave".
*   If "Miracle Flipper" is removed from play when it is destroyed in battle, its effect will still activate and it will be Special Summoned onto the opponent's side of the field.

  
## MIRACLE FUSION  
① Remove from play, from your side of the field or your Graveyard, Fusion Material Monsters that are listed on an "Elemental Hero" Fusion Monster Card, and Special Summon that Fusion Monster from your Fusion Deck. (This Special Summon is treated as a Fusion Summon.)

*   This performs a Fusion Summon, like "Polymerization". Face-down monsters you control can be used.
    *   You cannot activate this card while "Non-Fusion Area" is active.
*   This effect does not target. You remove the monsters from play when this effect resolves.
*   If you cannot remove from play the Fusion Material for the Fusion Monster you wanted to Summon (ex: "Elemental Hero Absolute Zero") but you have the correct material for a different Fusion Monster (ex: "Elemental Hero Gaia"), you MUST Summon that other monster instead.
*   Fusion Substitute Monsters like "King of the Swamp" can be used to replace monsters whose name are specifically listed on an "Elemental Hero" Fusion Monster.
*   VS. "Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer": You can only remove monsters on your field from play for this effect while your opponent controls a face-up Kycoo.

  
## MIRACLE JURASSIC EGG

*   If “Macro Cosmos” or “Dimensional Fissure” is face-up on the field when “Miracle Jurassic Egg” is destroyed, it will still be removed from play instead of going to the Graveyard.

  
## MIRACLE KIDS

*   You cannot activate “Miracle Kids” if you have no “Hero Kid” cards in your Graveyard.
*   The ATK reduction of “Miracle Kids” is determined and applied when “Miracle Kids” resolves. Even if a “Hero Kid” card is removed from the Graveyard after that, the ATK reduction of “Miracle Kids” remains.

  
## MIRACLE LOCUS

*   Because it modifies ATK, “Miracle Locus” can be activated in the Damage Step. But not during damage calculation or any point in the Damage Step after damage calculation.
*   Even if control of the targeted monster shifts to your opponent, it is your opponent who takes no Battle Damage this turn from battles involving the targeted monster.
*   The target of “Miracle Locus” can attack up to 2 monsters, or can attack directly. It cannot attack a monster and then also attack directly.
*   You can combine “Miracle Locus” with “Double Attack” and the monster can attack twice. In which case it could attack 2 monsters, or it could attack a monster and then attack directly, all with the +1000 ATK gain. However, your opponent would take no Battle Damage because of “Miracle Lotus’” effect.
*   You can target monsters with “Miracle Locus” that could otherwise attack multiple times (in order to give them the ATK boost).
*   Your opponent draws 1 card when “Miracle Locus” resolves.

  
## MIRACLE RESTORING

*   Removing 2 Spell Counters is a cost.

  
## MIRAGE DRAGON

*   The effect of this monster makes the opponent of this monster’s current controller unable to activate Trap Cards during the Battle Phase. If you take control of your opponent’s monster with "Change of Heart" during your turn, your opponent cannot activate Trap Cards during your Battle Phase, but you can.
*   The effect of this monster makes your opponent unable to activate Set Trap Cards. However, your opponent can still activate the effects of face-up Trap Cards such as "Type Zero Magic Crusher", "Ultimate Offering", "Skull Lair", "The Dragon’s Bead", and "Astral Barrier".

  
## MIRAGE KNIGHT

*   "Mirage Knight" cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, and cannot be Special Summoned EXCEPT by the effect of "Dark Flare Knight". So "Mirage Knight" cannot be Special Summoned with "Monster Reborn", etc., even if Special Summoned properly first.
*   "Mirage Knight" can be Special Summoned by "Dark Flare Knight"'s effect even if "Skill Drain" is active, because "Dark Flare Knight"'s effect activates in the Graveyard. However, "Mirage Knight"'s effects are negated by "Skill Drain".
*   When a "Mirage Knight" that was involved in battle is flipped face-down, it is not removed during the End Phase.
*   When a "Mirage Knight" that was involved in battle is removed from play with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter" or "Dimensionhole", it is not removed from play during the End Phase by its own effect.

  
## MIRAGE OF NIGHTMARE

*   If, after drawing during your opponent’s Standby Phase, your "Mirage of Nightmare" is destroyed before you have to discard, then you do not need to discard for its effect.
*   You may activate "Mystical Space Typhoon" during your Draw Phase to destroy "Mirage of Nightmare" before you have to discard during your Standby Phase. If your Draw Phase was skipped for some reason, you can still activate "Mystical Space Typhoon" to destroy "Mirage of Nightmare" before activating the effect of "Mirage of Nightmare" that will force you to discard. (You can activate any number of effects during your own Standby Phase in any order you wish, as long as required effects are dealt with by the time you leave the Standby Phase and enter your Main Phase 1.)
*   When the turn player controls "Mirage of Nightmare" and "Imperial Order":
*   If you draw for "Mirage of Nightmare" during your opponent’s Standby Phase, and then activate "Imperial Order" after that, during your Standby Phase you will have 2 mandatory effects: discarding for "Mirage of Nightmare" and paying 700 Life Points for "Imperial Order" or else destroying it. In this case, you choose which effect to resolve first, and you can choose to resolve "Mirage of Nightmare" first, even though its effect will be negated by "Imperial Order". So you activate its effect, and do not discard. Then you can choose not to pay 700 Life Points to keep "Imperial Order", and "Imperial Order" will be destroyed. Then you can enter Main Phase 1, and you did not have to discard for "Mirage of Nightmare" (because its effect was negated at the time you chose to resolve it).
*   When the turn player controls "Imperial Order" and the opponent controls "Mirage of Nightmare":
*   If the opponent controls "Mirage of Nightmare" going into the turn player’s Standby Phase, and the turn player already controls a face-up "Imperial Order", then there are 2 mandatory effects that must be resolved: the turn player must pay 700 Life Points or destroy "Imperial Order", and the opponent must draw cards for "Mirage of Nightmare". The turn player has priority to resolve an effect first. If the turn player passes, priority goes to the opponent. If the opponent also passes, then the turn player must resolve an effect, and must pay for "Imperial Order" or it is destroyed. If he does not pay, and "Imperial Order" is destroyed, then the opponent can draw for "Mirage of Nightmare".
*   The same procedure is used if both players control "Mirage of Nightmare". Generally, the turn player will first discard for "Mirage of Nightmare", then the opponent will draw for their "Mirage of Nightmare".
*   If you discard "Sinister Serpent" during your Standby Phase for the effect of "Mirage of Nightmare", you may add "Sinister Serpent" back to your hand during that same Standby Phase.
*   If you have multiple copies of "Mirage of Nightmare", you don’t draw for more than 1 because you have 4 cards in your hand from using the effect of only 1 of them; nor do you have to discard for the second copy because you didn’t draw any cards using its effect. If you draw so that you have 4 cards using 1 "Mirage of Nightmare", and some effect causes you to discard during that same Standby Phase, you may then activate the other "Mirage of Nightmare" to draw back up to 4; in this case you discard separately for each "Mirage of Nightmare" because you drew with both, and if 1 of them is destroyed you do not have to discard for its effect, only for the effect of the "Mirage of Nightmare" that was not destroyed.
*   If you have 4 or more cards in your hand during your opponent’s Standby Phase, do not draw, and do not discard during your next Standby Phase (the effect of "Mirage of Nightmare" is not applied).
*   If your Standby Phase is skipped because of "Solomon’s Lawbook", etc., do not discard for "Mirage of Nightmare".
*   Drawing for "Mirage of Nightmare" is considered 1 draw no matter how many cards are drawn, so you only gain 500 Life Points if you have "Solemn Wishes".
*   If you draw 3 cards for "Mirage of Nightmare", but only have 2 cards in your hand during your next Standby Phase, discard your entire hand (2 cards).

  
## MIRROR GATE

*   This card does not target.
*   If your "Elemental Hero" monster is in Defense Position, calculate damage as normal, using its DEF.
*   If you activate "Mirror Gate", Damage Calculation is resolved as part of the resolution of "Mirror Gate"'s effect. You cannot activate cards or effects that could usually be activated during the Damage Step.
*   If the attacking monster or the attack target is removed from the field by an effect chained to "Mirror Gate", "Mirror Gate" resolves without effect.

  
## MIRROR OF OATHS

*   “Mirror of Oaths” does not target.
*   You cannot activate “Mirror of Oaths” during the Damage Step.
*   You cannot activate “Mirror of Oaths” when your opponent Special Summons from the Extra Deck. Only from the Main Deck.
*   You must destroy a Special Summoned monster to draw a card for “Mirror of Oaths.” If a monster is Special Summoned from the Deck and you activate “Mirror of Oaths,” but an effect is chained that destroys that monster before “Mirror of Oaths” can destroy it, you do not draw a card. If you activate “Mirror of Oaths” in response to multiple monsters being Special Summoned, and effects are chained which destroy some, but not all, of those monsters, so that “Mirror of Oaths” destroys at least 1 of them, you draw a card.
*   If you destroy multiple monsters with “Mirror of Oaths,” you still only draw 1 card.
*   If “Mirror of Oaths” is used in response to 2 monsters being Special Summoned from the Graveyard and 1 from the Deck (at the same time), it only destroys the monster Special Summoned from the Deck.

  
## MIRROR WALL

*   If "Mirror Wall" is already face-up on the field when a monster declares an attack, "Mirror Wall" reduces the ATK of the attacking monster by half when the attack is declared.
*   If "Mirror Wall" is activated during an attack (including during the Damage Step), then it reduces the ATK of the attacking monster when "Mirror Wall" resolves. (Even though "Mirror Wall" normally reduces the attack by half when the attack is declared, it will still reduce the attack by half if you activate it after the attack is declared.)
*   If "Mirror Wall" halves the ATK of a monster, it remains halved as long as "Mirror Wall" remains face-up on the field. If "Mirror Wall" is removed from the field, the ATK of the monsters is restored.
*   If a monster attacks twice (over 2 turns, or if “Black Luster Soldier – Envoy of the Beginning” attacks twice in a row, etc.), its ATK is still only reduced by half once. So “Black Luster Soldier – Envoy of the Beginning” will have 1500 ATK for both of its attacks, for example.
*   If you have 2 copies of "Mirror Wall", and a monster attacks, its ATK is one-quarter. So “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” would have 750 ATK, for example. If 1 of the "Mirror Wall" copies leaves play, then the ATK is increased to half (if both copies leave play, the ATK is restored to full.)
*   You can activate "Mirror Wall" during the Damage Step before damage calculation.
*   The effect of "Mirror Wall" does not target.
*   "Reverse Trap" will have no effect on "Mirror Wall".

  
## MISFORTUNE

*   If an effect is chained that destroys the selected monster, removes it from the field, or flips it face-down, then no damage is inflicted. You still cannot attack that turn.
*   You can select your opponent’s “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6” for “Misfortune’s” effect and the opponent will still take damage. This is because “Misfortune” has no effect on the monster you select.
*   If you control “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6”, it can attack during the turn that you activated “Misfortune”.

  
## MIST ARCHFIEND

*   If "Mist Archfiend" is not in play in the End Phase, or when its effect resolves, its controller will not take 1000 damage.
*   If this card is turned face-down by "Book of Moon", etc. Chained to its effect, it will still be destroyed and its controller will take 1000 damage.
*   The effect of "Pandemonium" can be activated when "Mist Archfiend" is destroyed by its own effect.
*   If "Mist Archfiend" is Normal Summoned without Tribute, and control of it shifts to the opponent, its current controller will take the damage when its effect resolves during the End Phase.

  
## MIST WURM  
> ① When this card is Synchro Summoned, return up to 3 cards your opponent controls to the hand.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Trap Hole").
    *   This effect targets 1, 2, or 3 (face-up / face-down) cards your opponent controls.
    *   Targets are returned to the hand even if flipped face-up / face-down.

  
## MOBIUS THE FROST MONARCH  
> ① When this card is Tribute Summoned, you can destroy up to 2 Spell or Trap Cards on the field.

*   The ① Trigger Effect is OPTIONAL.
    *   This effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Trap Hole").
    *   This effect targets 1 or 2 (face-up / face-down) Spell / Trap Cards on the field.
    *   If one target leaves the field, the other target is still destroyed.
*   The ① effect CANNOT ACTIVATE:
    *   if Mobius was Tribute Summoned as Chain Link 2+ by "Ultimate Offering".
    *   if Mobius was Normal Summoned by "Mausoleum of the Emperor".
    *   if Mobius was Normal Summoned while treated as a Level 4 by "Cost Down".

  
## MOISTURE CREATURE

*   You can Summon "Moisture Creature" by Tributing 2 monsters, but the effect will not be activated.
*   You cannot Summon "Moisture Creature" by Tributing 3 monsters if there are no Spell or Trap Cards on your opponent’s side of the field.
*   If you activate the effect of "Moisture Creature" and your opponent chains "Book of Moon" to the effect, the effect still resolves and all Spell and Trap Cards on your opponent’s side of the field are destroyed.

  
## MOKEY MOKEY KING

*   When "Mokey Mokey King" that was Special Summoned by "Magical Scientist" is returned to the Extra Deck, it has been removed from the field so its effect activates and you Special Summon as many "Mokey Mokey" as possible from your Graveyard.
*   Missing the Timing: If "Mokey Mokey King" leaves the field in the middle of a chain (for example, if destroyed by "Ring of Destruction" chained to "Pot of Greed", or Tributed for a Tribute Summon or for the effect of "Cannon Soldier", etc.,), you miss the timing and you cannot Special Summon. Only when the last action of the chain is the removal of "Mokey Mokey King" from the field, can you activate its effect.

  
## MOKEY MOKEY SMACKDOWN

*   If the effect of "Mokey Mokey Smackdown" is activated (by a Fairy-Type monster on your side of the field being destroyed), and afterwards you Summon a "Mokey Mokey", that "Mokey Mokey" will also have 3000 ATK even though it wasn’t on the field when the Fairy-Type monster is destroyed.

  
## MOLTEN ZOMBIE

*   If you Special Summon "Molten Zombie" face-down with "The Shallow Grave", etc., its effect does not activate.
*   When you Special Summon "Molten Zombie" and you have "Card of Safe Return", either effect can be Step 1 of the chain; your choice.

  
## MOLTING ESCAPE

*   A monster equipped with 2 “Molting Escapes” will only avoid destruction by battle 1 time each turn. Both effects to gain 300 ATK will be applied individually.
*   The equipped monster will not gain 300 ATK if it battles while it cannot be destroyed by battle due to a different effect.
*   The ATK increases from “Molting Escape” are applied continuously and will disappear if “Molting Escape” is unequipped.
*   The effect to gain 300 ATK starts a Chain

  
## MONSTER GATE

*   If you pick up a Spirit Monster, you cannot Special Summon it and it is sent to the Graveyard.
*   If you pick up a Guardian and don't have the corresponding Equip Spell Card on the field, you cannot Special Summon the Guardian and it is sent to the Graveyard. If you have the corresponding Equip Spell Card, the Guardian is Special Summoned.
*   If you go through your whole Deck without finding a card to pick up, "Monster Gate"'s effect is negated and the cards you picked up are shuffled back into the Deck.
*   Your opponent can chain "Royal Oppression"'s effect to negate "Monster Gate"'s effect.
*   Cards picked up that cannot be Normal Summoned are considered "sent to the Graveyard", not "discarded".
*   If you Special Summon "Dark Magician of Chaos" with "Monster Gate", the effect of "Dark Magician of Chaos" activates, but it activates after "Monster Gate" has fully resolved and sent other picked up cards to the Graveyard, so you can use "Dark Magician of Chaos"' effect to retrieve a Spell Card that was picked up and sent to the Graveyard by "Monster Gate" in the process of searching for the "Dark Magician of Chaos".

  
## MONSTER RECOVERY

*   If you select a Fusion Monster or Synchro Monster, it returns to its owner's Extra Deck.
*   If you select your opponent's monster that you currently control, it is returned to your opponent's Deck.
*   You can select a Monster Token. It is removed from the field instead, because it cannot be shuffled into the Deck.

  
## MONSTER REINCARNATION  
> Discard 1 card. Add 1 Monster Card from your Graveyard to your hand.

*   This effect targets a card in the Graveyard \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=848277)\]. It is negated by "Necrovalley".
*   You discard a card for cost.
*   If you discard "Night Assailant", "Makyura the Destructor", or "Dandylion" their effects activate (in the Graveyard), starting a new chain, even if you retrieve the same card.

  
## MONTAGE DRAGON

*   You cannot Special Summon "Montage Dragon" while "Macro Cosmos" or "Dimensional Fissure", etc. is face-up on the field because you cannot send Monster Cards from your hand to the Graveyard.
*   If you send a WATER monster from your hand to the Graveyard while "A Legendary Ocean" is active, the original Level of the monster is used and not the reduced Level.
*   If "Montage Dragon" is flipped face-down by "Book of Moon", etc., when it is flipped face-up its ATK is 0.
*   If "Skill Drain" is active while "Montage Dragon" is face-up on the field, its ATK becomes 0. If "Skill Drain" is later negated or removed from the field, its ATK remains 0.

  
## MOON DRAGON QUILLA

*   The effect to gain Life Points does not target.
*   The effect to Special Summon “Sun Dragon Inti” does target.
*   The effect to Special Summon “Sun Dragon Inti” can be activated even during the Damage Step.
*   You activate the effect to Special Summon “Sun Dragon Inti” at the end of the Damage Step if “Moon Dragon Quilla” is destroyed by battle, and after the end of the Chain in which “Moon Dragon Quilla” is destroyed if it is destroyed by an effect.
*   If the monster that attacks “Moon Dragon Quilla” isn’t face-up on the field when the effect to gain Life Points resolves, you won’t gain any Life points.

  
## MORALE BOOST

*   If "Morale Boost" and other Equip Spell Cards are destroyed at the same time with "Harpie's Feather Duster" or "Heavy Storm", "Morale Boost" does not inflict any damage.
*   While your "Morale Boost" is active, and you activate your opponent's Equip Spell Card that you had because of "Exchange", when that Equip Spell Card is removed from the field it is you that takes the damage.
*   "Morale Boost"'s effect includes when monsters are equipped to "Relinquished" or "Sword Hunter", and when such equipped monsters are removed from the field.
*   "Morale Boost"'s effect includes "Kisetai", and Union Monsters equipped to another monster by their own effect, and when such equipped monsters are removed from the field, and when Union Monsters "detach" and become monsters again.
*   "Morale Boost"'s effect includes when you equip an Equip Spell Card to your opponent's monsters, and when such cards are removed from the field.
*   "Morale Boost"'s effect includes when you Summon "Guardian Elma" and resolve her effect.
*   "Morale Boost"'s effect includes when "Tailor of the Fickle" is used.

  
## MORAY OF GREED  
> Return 2 WATER monsters from your hand to your Deck and draw 3 cards.

*   Returning 2 WATER monsters to the Deck is an effect, not a cost.
*   If you have less than 2 WATER monsters in hand when this card resolves, it resolves without effect.

  
## MORPHING JAR

*   If there are fewer than 5 cards in the Deck of either player when this card’s Flip Effect is activated, that player will lose the Duel, since the text of this card says "draw".

  
## MORPHING JAR #2

*   The cards are "picked up", not drawn.
*   If a high level monster, Ritual Monster, or a "Special Summon only" monster is revealed, it is sent to the Graveyard but is counted towards the number of monsters that need to be "picked up".
*   When 6 or more Monster Cards are returned to your Deck, you will pick up cards until you pick up an equal amount of Monster Cards, but only the first 5 that can Special Summoned are Special Summoned. For example, when 7 monsters are returned to your Deck, you will pick up cards until you reveal 7 Monster Cards, but only the first 5 that can be Special Summoned are Special Summoned.
*   Fusion Monsters and Synchro Monsters on the field are returned to the Extra Deck and are not counted towards the number of monsters returned to the Deck.
*   Monster Tokens on the field are removed from the field and are not counted towards the number of monsters returned to the Deck.
*   If "Morphing Jar #2" is flipped by an attack and it is destroyed, it is not shuffled into its owner's Deck.
*   If "Light of Intervention" is active, the Monster Cards are Special Summoned in face-up Defense Position.

  
## MORPHTRANSITION

*   This card targets both the attacking monster and the attack target monster.
*   If the attacking monster is no longer on the field when “Morphtransition” resolves, the targeted “Morphtronic” monster’s battle position cannot be changed.

  
## MORPHTRONIC ACCELERATOR

*   Returning 1 "Morphtronic" monster from your hand to the Deck is not a cost.
*   "Morphtronic Accelerator" targets 1 card on the field.
*   When the "Morphtronic" monster is returned from your hand to the Deck, the Deck is shuffled before the targeted card is destroyed and before you draw 1 card.
*   Destroying the target and drawing 1 card are considered to happen at the same time.
*   If you do not have any cards remaining in your Deck, you cannot activate "Morphtronic Accelerator".
*   If you cannot destroy the targeted card, you must still return 1 "Morphtronic" card from your hand to the Deck, but you do not draw 1 card.
*   If you do not have a “Morphtronic” monster in your hand when "Morphtronic Accelerator" resolves, "Morphtronic Accelerator"'s effect disappears.

  
## MORPHTRONIC BIND

*   If you activate “Morphtronic Bind” after an attack is already declared, the attack resolves as normal.

  
## MORPHTRONIC BOOMBOXEN

*   If "Morphtronic Boomboxen" activates its Attack Position effect, and an effect is chained that changes it to Defense Position, its effect still resolves.
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, the Attack Position and Defense Position effects of "Morphtronic Boomboxen" cannot be activated, because the "While in Attack Position" and "While in Defense Position" effects are negated.

  
## MORPHTRONIC CAMERAN

*   While "Skill Drain" is active, the Attack Position and Defense Position effects of "Morphtronic Cameran" cannot be activated, because the "While in Attack Position" and "While in Defense Position" effects are negated. If "Morphtronic Cameran" is destroyed by battle while in Attack Position, its effect will not activate because it was destroyed by battle while its "While in Attack Position" effect was being negated.

  
## MORPHTRONIC CELFON

*   "Royal Oppression" can be chained to the Attack Position effect of "Morphtronic Celfon".
*   If an effect is chained that removes "Morphtronic Celfon" from the field, its Attack or Defense Position effect that was activated will still resolve.
*   The Attack Position effect of "Morphtronic Celfon" cannot be activated if there are no "Morphtronic" monsters left in your Deck.
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, the Attack Position and Defense Position effects of "Morphtronic Celfon" cannot be activated, because the "While in Attack Position" and "While in Defense Position" effects are negated.
*   If you cannot Special Summon a monster (due to "Scapegoat", etc.), you cannot activate "Morphtronic Celfon"'s Attack Position effect. If you activate "Morphtronic Celfon"'s Attack Position effect and an effect is chained that prevents you from Special Summoning monster(s), you will still roll a die and reveal cards from the top of your Deck equal to the result, but the Level 4 or lower "Morphtronic" monster that would be Special Summoned is destroyed instead.
*   You cannot activate "Morphtronic Celfon"'s Attack Position effect if you have no cards left in your Deck. If you have at least 1 card left in your Deck, you can activate the Attack Position effect. In this case, if you roll a 2 or higher, you will still reveal the 1 card left in your Deck.
*   You do not show your opponent the cards you look at with “Morphtronic Celfon’s” Defense Position effect.

  
## MORPHTRONIC CLOCKEN

*   "Morphtronic Clocken"'s Defense Position effect to inflict damage cannot be activated if it does not have any Morph Counters.
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, the Attack Position and Defense Position effects of "Morphtronic Radion" cannot be activated, because the "While in Attack Position" and "While in Defense Position" effects are negated.
*   If you activate "Morphtronic Clocken"'s effect to gain a Morph Counter and an effect is chained that changes it to Attack Position, it still gains a Morph Counter.

  
## MORPHTRONIC CORD

*   "Morphtronic Cord"'s effect targets 1 Spell or Trap Card.
*   "Morphtronic Cord"'s effect is mandatory. If it is the only Spell or Trap Card on the field when the equipped "Morphtronic" monster's Battle Position is changed, it must target itself with its effect.
*   If "Morphtronic Cord" is equipped to a Level 4 or higher "Morphtronic" monster while "Level Limit - Area-B" is active, when the equipped "Morphtronic" monster's Battle Position to changed to Attack Position, it is immediately shifted back into Defense Position. When this occurs, the Trigger Effect of "Morphtronic Cord" only activates once.

  
## MORPHTRONIC DATATRON

*   While "Skill Drain" is active, the Attack Position and Defense Position effects of "Morphtronic Datatron" cannot be activated, because the "While in Attack Position" and "While in Defense Position" effects are negated.
*   "Morphtronic Datatron" can be Tributed to activate its Attack Position effect.
*   If "Morphtronic Datatron" activates its Attack Position effect, and an effect is chained that changes it to Defense Position, its effect still resolves.

  
## MORPHTRONIC ENGINE

*   The effect of “Morphtronic Engine” makes the equipped monster’s current ATK equal to twice its original ATK. The new ATK value is not considered to be the monster’s original ATK.
*   If the Level of the equipped "Morphtronic" monster changes to a value other than 3, "Morphtronic Engine" is destroyed.
*   If your second Standby Phase after activating "Morphtronic Engine" is skipped, or if the "Morphtronic Engine" cannot be destroyed (due to "Magic Reflector", etc.), "Morphtronic Engine" is not destroyed and remains equipped to the "Morphtronic" monster. The monster's original ATK remains doubled.
*   The effect to destroy the equipped "Morphtronic" monster during your second Standby Phase after activating "Morphtronic Engine" starts a Chain.
*   If a "Morphtronic" monster is equipped with 2 or more copies of "Morphtronic Engine", the additional copies are redundant because only the monster's original ATK is doubled.

  
## MORPHTRONIC FORCEFIELD

*   You can chain “Morphtronic Forcefield” to effects that do not target, like “Dark Hole”. You cannot chain “Morphtronic Forcefield” to effects that are uncertain to destroy a “Morphtronic” monster like “Fissure” or “Smashing Ground”, even if the only monsters you control are “Morphtronic” monsters. If you don’t have any “Morphtronic” monsters in your Deck, you cannot activate “Morphtronic Forcefield”. You can only chain “Morphtronic Forcefield” to a card that destroys a “Morphtronic” monster at resolution, not to a card that will destroy one in the future. So you cannot chain it to “Ekibyo Drakmord”, “Blind Destruction”, or “Needle Wall”. You cannot activate “Morphtronic Forcefield” if “Thunder King Rai-Oh” is on the field. If an effect is chained to “Morphtronic Forcefield” that Summons “Thunder King Rai-Oh”, you will not be able to add a “Morphtronic” monster to your hand, but “Morphtronic Forcefield” will still negate the Spell or Trap Card that it was chained to.

  
## MORPHTRONIC MAGNEN

*   If you control an Attack Position "Morphtronic Magnen" and another monster, when your opponent attacks the other monster and and effect is activated that changes "Morphtronic Magnen" into Defense Position, the other monster is still attacked because it has already been selected as an attack target.
*   While "Skill Drain" is active, the Attack Position and Defense Position effects of "Morphtronic Magnen" cannot be activated, because the "While in Attack Position" and "While in Defense Position" effects are negated.
*   If your opponent controls "Command Knight" and another monster with less ATK, your "Morphtronic Magnen" cannot attack because it cannot attack the "Command Knight".
*   If your opponent controls a monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" and another monster with higher ATK, your "Morphtronic Magnen" must attack the monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" if it attacks.
*   If you control a "Morphtronic Magnen" equipped with "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" and your opponent controls a face-up monster, your "Morphtronic Magnen" can only attack your opponent's monster. It cannot attack directly.
*   If you control 2 or more "Morphtronic Magnens" in Defense Position, your opponent cannot attack, unless they control a monster that can attack directly due to an effect.

  
## MORPHTRONIC MAGNEN BAR

*   Neither of this card’s effects target.
*   If 1 of the monsters that was in Attack Position when this card’s Attack Position effect was activated is switched to Defense Position before the effect resolves, this card still gains the combined ATK of the 2 monsters.
*   If another monster is switched to Attack Position before this card’s Attack Position effect resolves, this card still gains the combined ATK of the 2 monsters that were in Attack Position when the effect was activated.
*   If 1 of the monsters that was in Attack Position when this card’s Attack Position effect was activated is no longer on the field when the effect resolves, this card only gains the ATK of the remaining monster.
*   You cannot activate this card’s Attack Position effect during Main Phase 2.

  
## MORPHTRONIC MAP

*   Placing Morph Counters on this card does not start a chain. Special Summoning 1 “Morphtronic” monster with this card’s effect does start a chain, and does target. If you activate another Field Spell Card to replace your “Morphtronic Map”, the effect of “Morphtronic Map” misses the timing and no “Morphtronic” monster is Special Summoned. However, if you Set a Field Spell Card to replace your “Morphtronic Map”, the timing is not missed, and “Morphtronic Map” can Special Summon 1 “Morphtronic” monster. If your opponent activates a Field Spell Card and destroys your “Morphtronic Map”, the effect of “Morphtronic Map” activates and you can Special Summon 1 “Morphtronic” monster. If your opponent Sets a Field Spell Card, your “Morphtronic Map” is not destroyed at all, so of course no “Morphtronic” monster is Special Summoned. If multiple monsters have their battle positions changed at the same time, only 1 Morph Counter is placed on this card. If “Level Limit – Area B” is in effect, and you change a Level 4+ monster’s battle position to Attack Position (and it immediately changes back to Defense Position due to “Level Limit – Area B”, only 1 Morph Counter is added to “Morphtronic Map”.
*   No Morph Counters are placed on “Morphtronic Map” when a monster is flipped from face-down Defense Position to face-up Defense Position, since its battle position is unchanged.

  
## MORPHTRONIC MIX-UP

*   “Morphtronic Mix-up” targets 2 cards at activation. Your opponent picks a card at resolution. If something happened during the chain to remove 1 of the 2 cards, the remaining card is automatically chosen.

  
## MORPHTRONIC MONITRON

*   This effect starts a Chain when a “Morphtronic” monster is Summoned.
*   You cannot activate this card (flip it face-up), or activate its effect, during the Damage Step.

  
## MORPHTRONIC RADION

*   While "Skill Drain" is active, the Attack Position and Defense Position effects of "Morphtronic Radion" cannot be activated, because the "While in Attack Position" and "While in Defense Position" effects are negated.

  
## MORPHTRONIC REMOTEN

*   Removing a card for the Attack Position effect of “Morphtronic Remoten” is not a cost, it’s part of the effect. The effect targets the “Morphtronic” monster in your Graveyard. So if you activate the effect and “D.D. Crow” is chained to remove the targeted card from play, the effect does not resolve.
*   Sending a card to the Graveyard for the Defense Position effect of “Morphtronic Remoten” is not a cost, either. It is part of the effect. The Defense Position effect of “Morphtronic Remoten” does not target.
*   If “Macro Cosmos” is active, you can send a card to the Graveyard for the Defense Position effect of “Morphtronic Remoten,” but the effect to add a monster to your hand will not resolve.
*   If you have no “Morphtronic” monsters in your Graveyard, you cannot activate the Defense Position effect of “Morphtronic Remoten.”

  
## MORPHTRONIC REPAIR UNIT

*   Sending a “Morphtronic” monster to the Graveyard is a cost to activate “Morphtronic Repair Unit.” The effect targets 1 “Morphtronic” monster in your Graveyard.
*   There must be a “Morphtronic” monster in your Graveyard in order to activate “Morphtronic Repair Unit.” However, as long as there is an eligible target in your Graveyard, you can send a “Morphtronic” monster from your hand to the Graveyard,and then target the monster you just sent. If there are no “Morphtronic” monsters in your Graveyard, you cannot do this.

  
## MORPHTRONIC RUSTY ENGINE

*   This effect starts a chain, when the equipped monster is destroyed and “Morphtronic Rusty Engine” is sent to the Graveyard (or removed from play due to “Macro Cosmos”, etc.).

  
## MOSAIC MANTICORE

*   "Mosaic Manticor"'s effect is a Trigger Effect that activates during the Standby Phase of your next turn.
*   "Mosaic Manticore"'s effect does not target.
*   The effects of the monsters Special Summoned by "Mosaic Manticore" are only negated if they activate on the field or are applied while the monster is on the field. If a monster Special Summoned by "Mosaic Manticore" has an effect that activates while it is in the Graveyard or when it is sent to the Graveyard, the effect will not be negated.
*   If "Mosaic Manticore" is removed from the field before your next Standby Phase after Tribute Summoning it, the monsters you Tributed are not Special Summoned.
*   If you Tribute 2 monsters to Tribute Summon "Mosaic Manticore" and 1 of the monsters is removed from the Graveyard, during your next Standby Phase you will Special Summon the monster that is still in your Graveyard.
*   If you only have 1 open Monster Card Zone during your next Standby Phase after Tribute Summoning "Mosaic Manticore", when "Mosaic Manticore"'s effect resolves, choose 1 of the 2 Tributed monsters and Special Summon it.
*   If 1 of the 2 monsters Tributed to Tribute Summon "Mosaic Manticore" cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard, when "Mosaic Manticore"'s effect resolves in your next Standby Phase, Special Summon the monster that can be Special Summoned.
*   If you Tribute monsters to Set "Mosaic Manticore", "Mosaic Manticore"'s effect can be activated if it is flipped face-up before your next Standby Phase.
*   If your "Mosaic Manticore" is flipped face-down after being Tributed Summoned and is flipped face-up before your next Standby Phase, its effect can be activated during your next Standby Phase.
*   If your opponent takes control of your "Mosaic Manticore" after you Tribute Summon it and retains control of it during your next Standby Phase, "Mosaic Manticore"'s effect does not activate. If control of "Mosaic Manticore" is returned to your before your next Standby Phase after you Tribute Summoned "Mosaic Manticore", its effect activates during your next Standby Phase.
*   If you Tribute your opponent's monster, it will be Special Summoned onto your side of the field when "Mosaic Manticore"'s effect resolves.
*   If a monster Tributed to Tribute Summon "Mosaic Manticore" is removed from the Graveyard and is later returned to your Graveyard, the monster is not Special Summoned by "Mosaic Manticore"'s effect.
*   Even if "Mosaic Manticore" is removed from the field, the monsters Special Summoned by its effect still cannot attack and their effects are still negated.
*   If a monster Special Summoned by the effect of "Mosaic Manticore" is flipped face-down, after it is flipped face-up it can attack and its effects are not negated.
*   If "Skill Drain" is activated after the monsters Tributed to Tribute Summon "Mosaic Manticore" are Special Summoned by its effect, the monsters still cannot attack and their effects are negated.
*   If you Special Summon "Exiled Force" with "Mosaic Manticore"'s effect, you can activate the effect of "Exiled Force", but its effect is negated.

  
## MOTHER GRIZZLY

*   If you attack with your "Mother Grizzly" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you may attack with the monster Special Summoned by "Mother Grizzly" before entering Main Phase 2.
*   If your opponent controls your "Mother Grizzly" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you get the effect of "Mother Grizzly" NOT your opponent.
*   Since the Special Summoning occurs during the Damage Step, "Torrential Tribute", etc. cannot be used.

  
## MOTHER SPIDER

*   If you have only Insect-Type monsters in your Graveyard, you can send 2 face-up Defense Position monsters your opponent controls to the Graveyard and Special Summon this card from your hand.
*   You can Normal Summon this monster.

  
## MUCUS YOLK

*   Zero damage is not damage, so "Mucus Yolk" must have its ATK increased somehow in order to inflict damage to the opponent and activate its effect.
*   "Mucus Yolk" can continue to activate its effect over and over again, as long as it keeps inflicting Battle Damage to the opponent.
*   If "Mucus Yolk" inflicts damage multiple times in the same turn, such as with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light – Tryce", it only increases by 1000 points during your next Standby Phase.

  
## MULTIPLE PIECE GOLEM

*   "Multiple Piece Golem"'s effect is a Trigger Effect. It does not target.
*   "Multiple Piece Golem" is returned to the Extra Deck when its effect resolves. Returning it is not a cost.

  
## MULTIPLICATION OF ANTS

*   You can Tribute a face-down Insect-Type monster when you activate "Multiplication of Ants".

  
## MULTIPLY

*   You cannot activate “Multiply” during the Damage Step.

  
## MUSTERING OF THE DARK SCORPIONS

*   If you have 2 copies of "Cliff the Trap Remover" (for example) in your hand, you can Special Summon 1 of them with "Mustering of the Dark Scorpions". You can Special Summon him even if you already have "Cliff the Trap Remover" on your side of the field from before you activated "Mustering of the Dark Scorpions".
*   You don't have to Special Summon all possible monsters with "Mustering of the Dark Scorpions"; you can keep some in your hand if you want.
*   If your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to "Mustering of the Dark Scorpions" to destroy your "Don Zaloog", "Mustering of the Dark Scorpions" still resolves.

  
## MUTANT MINDMASTER  
> ① When this card declares an attack, you can take control of 1 face-up Attack Position monster your opponent controls, and attack with it instead of this monster. Ⓒ It cannot attack your opponent directly. Return it to your opponent at the end of the Battle Phase.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates and resolves in the Battle Step (Substep 1 - Attack Declaration)
    *   This effect targets 1 face-up Attack Position monster your opponent controls.
        *   A monster that cannot attack cannot be targeted by this effect.
    *   The monster that changed control can attack (in place of "Mutant Mindmaster"), choose the attack target and enter the Damage Step. This DOES NOT cause a REPLAY to occur.
    *   If "Magic Cylinder" is activated in Chain to the effect of "Mutant Mindmaster", the attack of "Mutant Mindmaster" will be negated, but the effect of "Mutant Mindmaster" will not be negated, so the effect will resolve as normal. (The targeted monster changes control, and if it can attack, it performs damage calculation with an opponent's monster.)

  
## MY BODY AS A SHIELD  
> ① Activate only by paying 1500 Life Poitns when your opponent activates a card with an effect that would destroy 1 or more monster(s) on the field. Negate the activation of that card and destroy it.

*   Paying 1500 Life Points is a cost.
*   CAN be chained to the activation of a Card OR Effect that destroys a monster(s) on the field.
    *   This includes face-up Spell / Trap Cards (ex: "Blaze Accelerator", "Royal Oppression") and Spell / Trap Cards in the Graveyard (ex: "Blast With Chain") \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=814506), [REF2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=829354), [REF3](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=17106978&postcount=23), [REF4](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=894173)\].
*   CANNOT be activated during the Damage Step.
*   CANNOT negate "Heavy Storm" that would destroy a monster(s) treated as an Equip Spell Card.
*   CANNOT be chained to a Card OR Effect that might not destroy a monster(s).
    *   Examples include: "Magical Dimension", "Barrel Dragon", and "Time Wizard" \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/113775-time-wizard-vs-my-body-as-a-shield/)\].

> Konami policy regarding card legality and cards with [erratas](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Errata) (section IX. subsection G. of the [policy document](https://img.yugioh-card.com/en/gameplay/penalty_guide/YGOTCG_Policy_v_2_1.pdf)) state that "you are required to play all copies of your cards according to the most recent text". Therefore, the language used and the consequences of this erratum are essential to authentic Edison Format play. (SJC Edison was played with the TU2 erratum, but the GLD3 erratum better communicates this card's ability to respond to the activation of a Card OR Effect.)


  
## MYSTERIOUS PUPPETEER

*   When you have "Mysterious Puppeteer" face-up on the field, if you Summon a monster and you opponent activates "Trap Hole" your monster is destroyed and you still gain 500 Life Points, since the monster was Summoned and then destroyed.

  
## MYSTERIOUS TRIANGLE

*   “Mysterious Triangle” targets the monster it destroys. If “Vanity’s Fiend” is preventing Special Summons, and it has an A-Counter, you can destroy it with “Mysterious Triangle” then Special Summon an Alien. If an effect is chained to “Mysterious Triangle” that removes the target’s A-Counter, it is not destroyed. (Example: if it is flipped face-down with “Book of Moon”.) If the targeted monster is not destroyed for some reason, no Alien is Special Summoned.

  
## MYSTIC SWORDSMAN LV2

*   If "Mystic Swordsman LV2" attacks a face-down Defense Position monster, that monster is destroyed by "Mystic Swordsman LV2"’s effect, not as a result of battle. So you cannot use its second effect to Special Summon "Mystic Swordsman LV4" during the End Phase.
*   If a level monster fulfills its condition to Special Summon the next-highest level (for example, if "Armed Dragon LV5" destroys a monster as a result of battle), and the level monster is then flipped face-down, or removed from play permanently, or sent to the Graveyard and then Special Summoned from the Graveyard, then its condition is reset and it is no longer considered to have met the condition to level up to the next level.

  
## MYSTIC SWORDSMAN LV4

*   The Normal Summon of this card is always considered a Set. If "Light of Intervention" is active, you cannot Normal Summon "Mystic Swordsman LV4" because it can only be Normal Summoned face-down, which "Light of Intervention" makes impossible to do.
*   If "Mystic Swordsman LV4" attacks a face-down Defense Position monster, you destroy the monster with "Mystic Swordsman LV4"’s effect before flipping the monster face-up. Effects like "D. D. Warrior Lady" cannot activate.
*   If a level monster fulfills its condition to Special Summon the next-highest level (for example, if "Armed Dragon LV5" destroys a monster as a result of battle), and the level monster is then flipped face-down, or removed from play permanently, or sent to the Graveyard and then Special Summoned from the Graveyard, then its condition is reset and it is no longer considered to have met the condition to level up to the next level.

  
## MYSTIC SWORDSMAN LV6

*   The Normal Summon (Tribute Summon) of this monster is the same as, and always considered, a Tribute Set. This card must be in face-down Defense Position when it is Normal Summoned (Tribute Summoned). If you Normal Summon (Tribute Summon) this monster, it is placed face-down on the field; you do not have to show your opponent what monster it is.
*   If your "Mystic Swordsman LV6" destroys your own monster that is being controlled by your opponent, that monster is sent to the Graveyard. You cannot return it to the top of your opponent’s Deck or the top of your own Deck.
*   If you activate the effect of "Mystic Swordsman LV6" to place a face-down monster on top of your opponent’s Deck, you do not get to look at it.
*   If "Mystic Swordsman LV6" attacks a face-down monster, its effect activates at the beginning of the Damage Step, before the monster is flipped face-up. If "Ceasefire" was activated during the Battle Step to flip the monster face-up, then the effect of "Mystic Swordsman LV6" is not activated.
*   A monster destroyed by the effect of "Mystic Swordsman LV6" is not destroyed as a result of battle. There is no damage calculation. It is not flipped face-up. Any Flip Effects it has are not activated.

  
## MYSTIC TOMATO

*   If you attack with your "Mystic Tomato" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you may attack with the monster Special Summoned by "Mystic Tomato" before entering Main Phase 2.
*   If your opponent controls your "Mystic Tomato" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you get the effect of "Mystic Tomato" NOT your opponent.
*   Since the Special Summoning occurs during the Damage Step, "Torrential Tribute", etc. cannot be used.

  
## MYSTICAL CARDS OF LIGHT

*   You select which Spell & Trap Card Zone to make unusable when you activate "Mystical Cards of Light".
*   You cannot activate "Mystical Cards of Light" if you do not have a Spell & Trap Card Zone to make unusable.
*   Drawing 2 cards with "Mystical Cards of Light" does not start a Chain.
*   You can choose to draw only 1 card.
*   You cannot choose to draw 2 cards if you have 1 card remaining in your Deck.
*   If "Mystical Cards of Light"'s effect is negated, you can activate or Set Spell and Trap Cards into the unusable Spell & Trap Card Zone. If the effect of "Mystical Cards of Light" is reapplied while a Spell or Trap Card is in the unusable Spell & Trap Card Zone, the Spell & Trap Card Zone become unusable when the Spell or Trap Card is removed from the field.

  
## MYSTICAL KNIGHT OF JACKAL

*   In order to activate the effect of "Mystical Knight of Jackal", the monster that "Mystical Knight of Jackal" destroyed as a result of battle must be your opponent’s own monster, not one of your monsters that your opponent controls.
*   "Mystical Knight of Jackal" sends a monster to the Graveyard as a result of battle, and THEN returns it to the top of the deck, so "Sangan" or "Witch of the Black Forest", etc., will activate their effects.
*   If "Banisher of the Light" is in play, the monster is removed from play and "Mystical Knight of Jackal" does not activate its effect so the monster does not return to the top of the Deck.
*   If "Mystical Knight of Jackal" attacks a face-down "Man-Eater Bug", and "Man-Eater Bug" destroys "Mystical Knight of Jackal", then the effect of "Mystical Knight of Jackal" is not applied.
*   "Mystical Knight of Jackal" does activate its effect even if "Necrovalley" is in play.
*   When "Mystical Knight of Jackal" attacks "Mystic Tomato", during the End Step both effects activate simultaneously once "Mystic Tomato" is sent to the Graveyard, so they form a chain. The turn player’s effect is Step 1 of a chain, and the opponent’s is Step 2; so "Mystic Tomato" resolves first, and a monster is Special Summoned and the Deck shuffled. Then the turn player chooses whether to place "Mystic Tomato" on top of the owner’s Deck with the effect of "Mystical Knight of Jackal".

  
## MYSTICAL SHEEP #1  
> ① You can substitute this card for any 1 Fusion-Material Monster. When you do this, the other Fusion-Material Monster(s) must be the correct one(s).

*   The ① effect does not have any classification. It is not an Ignition, Trigger, Quick, or Continuous Effect.
    *   This effect does not target.
    *   Using "Mystical Sheep #1" as a Fusion Material does not start a Chain Link.
    *   This effect _"You can substitute this card for any 1 Fusion Material monster"_ of a monster like "King of the Swamp" is not applied while the monster is banished. If you activate "Parallel World Fusion", then you cannot use it as a substitute for a Fusion Material.
    *   The effect _"You can substitute this card for any 1 Fusion Material Monster"_ of a monster like "King of the Swamp" or "Goddess with the Third Eye" is not applied while the monster is in the Deck.
    *   When Special Summoning "Chimeratech Fortress Dragon" or "XYZ-Dragon Cannon", you cannot send to the Graveyard a monster like "The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion" as a substitute for a Fusion Material.

  
## MYSTIK WOK

*   Tributing a monster for "Mystik Wok" is a cost, so you can Tribute "The Legendary Fisherman" or "The Agent of Force - Mars".

*   You select ATK or DEF when "Mystik Wok" is activated.
*   You can Tribute face-down monsters, or your opponent's monster using "Soul Exchange".

  
## MYTHICAL BEAST CERBERUS

*   If the monster battling “Mythical Beast Cerberus” is removed from the field before (or during) damage calculation, the Spell Counters on “Cerberus” will not be removed.
*   Removing the Spell Counters from “Mythical Beast Cerberus” does not start a chain.
*   The Spell Counters on “Mythical Beast Cerberus” are removed after he battles no matter which player is attacking.
*   You place a Spell Counter on this card when the Spell Card resolves, so if "Magic Jammer" is used to negate the Spell Card's activation then you do not place a Spell Counter on this monster. But if "Imperial Order" is chained to the Spell Card, you still place a Spell Counter on this monster because the activation of the Spell Card was not negated. If the Spell Card was a Continuous, Equip, or Field Spell Card, and “Dust Tornado” is chained to its activation and destroys it before it resolves you still place a Spell Counter because the activation of the card was not negated.
*   "Mythical Beast Cerberus" must be face-up on the field when the Spell Card is activated in order to get a Spell Counter.

  
## NANOBREAKER

*   This card’s effect is a Trigger Effect that starts a chain.

  
## NARROW PASS

*   "Narrow Pass" can only be activated when Player A has 2 or fewer monsters and Player B has 2 or fewer monsters. So if there are 3 monsters in play (2 controlled by A and 1 by B) you can activate "Narrow Pass". But if either player controls 3 or more monsters on his side of the field then you cannot activate this card.
*   Once "Narrow Pass" is activate, as long as it remains face-up on the field, Player A can Normal Summon or Set 2 up to 2 additional monsters, and Player B can Normal Summon or Set up to 2 additional monsters. It is helpful to place counters on "Narrow Pass" to keep track.
*   If "Narrow Pass" is activate, and a player Normal Summons his 2 permitted monsters afterwards, if 1 of those is destroyed then he cannot replace it with another Normal Summon. Each player gets 2 additional Normal Summons or Sets, no matter what happens to those monsters afterwards.
*   "Narrow Pass" does not restrict Special Summons or Flip Summons.

A new chain starts since "Necroface"'s ② effect has met its trigger condition.

## NEO SPACE

*   If “UFOroid Fighter” is Fusion Summoned with “Elemental Hero Neos” being used as the 1 Warrior-Type monster, “UFOroid Fighter” will NOT be affected by “Neo Space” because “Elemental Hero Neos” is not listed by name on the card.

  
## NEOS FORCE

*   This card’s damage inflicting effect starts a Chain.
*   The damage inflicted by this effect is equal to the destroyed monster’s ATK in the Graveyard.
*   This card’s effect to return itself to the Deck is activated during the End Phase and starts a Chain.

## NEO-SPACIAN AQUA DOLPHIN

*   This effect does not target.
*   When this effect resolves you look at your opponent’s hand. If there are no Monster Cards, do nothing.

*   If the selected Monster Card in your opponent’s hand has ATK ?, since it is undetermined, you cannot control a monster with greater or equal ATK, and you will take 500 damage.

  
## NEO-SPACIAN DARK PANTHER

*   “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther’s” effect is only applied while it is face-up on the field. So if you target “Sangan” and then this card is sent to the Graveyard nothing will happen, because in the Graveyard it no longer copies “Sangan’s” effect.
*   If “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” is flipped face-down after using its effect, the effect is no longer applied. You could flip it face-up and activate its effect again in the same turn.
*   When you use this card’s effect to copy another monster’s name, its name is not considered to be “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” for the duration of the effect. If you targeted “Cyber Dragon” then activate “Next to be Lost” you would send a “Cyber Dragon” from your Deck to the Graveyard and not “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther”.
*   If “Skill Drain” is activated after “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther’s” effect has resolved, the effects that the “Dark Panther” copied will be negated, but it will still keep the copied card name until the end of the turn.
*   You can target “D. D. Warrior Lady” and if “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” battles with an opponent’s monster you can use the copied effect and remove both monsters from play, because “D. D. Warrior Lady’s” effect activates on the field.
*   You can target “Exiled Force” and then Tribute “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” to destroy 1 monster on the field.
*   If you target “Spirit Reaper”, the “Spirit Reaper” will be destroyed after “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther’s” effect resolves.
*   You can target “Embodiment of Apophis” when it is a monster but only the card name will be copied. It does not have an effect to copy. “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” will NOT be treated as a Trap Card.
*   If you target “Relinquished” or “Sword Hunter” then you can equip “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” with Monster Cards through the copied effect, but at the end of the turn, the effect that allowed them to be equipped disappears, and the equipped cards are destroyed.
*   You can target a Union Monster and equip “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” to an appropriate monster, but at the end of the turn the copied effect disappears and “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” will be destroyed.
*   If you target “Strike Ninja” you can remove from play “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” with the copied effect, but then it will no longer be face-up on the field, so the copied effect disappears and “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” remains removed from play.
*   If you target “Cyber Harpie Lady”, “Harpie Lady 1”, etc., then “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther’s” name will just be “Harpie Lady” for the duration of its effect.
*   If you target “Proto-Cyber Dragon”, “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther’s” name will be treated as “Cyber Dragon” because of the copied effect.
*   If you target a monster with an effect that accumulates Spell Counters, such as “Skilled Dark Magician”, any Spell Counters on “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” will be removed when its effect ends.
*   You can target your opponent’s “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” but the copied effect is the same as the one you just used, so you cannot activate it a second time that turn.
*   If you target an “LV” monster, you could Tribute the “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” to activate the Spell Card “Level Up!”. It will be in the Graveyard when “Level Up!” resolves, so it will no longer have the copied effect, so there is no monster name to reference and therefore the effect disappears.
*   If you copy an Ignition or Trigger Effect, those effects can be chained to when they are activated, as normal.
*   When “Neo-Spacian Dark Panther” is destroyed after copying the effects of a "Crystal Beast" monster, it cannot be placed into the Spell and Trap Card Zone.

  
## NEO-SPACIAN FLARE SCARAB

*   If your opponent has “Embodiment of Apophis” on the field as a monster, it is still treated as 1 Trap Card, so “Neo-Spacian Flare Scarab” gains 400 ATK.

  
## NEO-SPACIAN GLOW MOSS

*   This effect activates when the attack is declared. It is a Trigger Effect and can be chained to. The act of drawing and revealing a card is resolved when the Trigger Effect resolves. If a face-down “Neo-Spacian Glow Moss” is attacked, its effect does not activate.
*   The Spell Card effect (“…You can change this attack to a direct attack instead”) only works when “Neo-Spacian Glow Moss” is attacking. Not when it is attacked.
*   If a Spell Card is drawn and revealed, and you choose to convert the attack to a direct attack, it causes a replay.
*   If “Neo-Spacian Glow Moss” attacks directly with its effect and “Skill Drain” is activated in response, “Neo-Spacian Glow Moss” can no longer attack directly and (another) replay will occur.
*   If “Neo-Spacian Glow Moss” is attacking, and a Trap Card is drawn and revealed for its effect, it changes to Defense Position and is no longer considered an attacking monster, so damage calculation is not performed.
*   If a monster attacks a face-down “Ancient Lamp”, and “Ancient Lamp” re-directs the attack to “Neo-Spacian Glow Moss”, the effect of “Neo-Spacian Glow Moss” will not activate, because the effect of “Ancient Lamp” causes it to miss the timing.
*   This effect does not target.

  
## NEO-SPACIAN GRAND MOLE  
> ① If this card battles with your opponent's monster, you can return both monsters to their owners' hands at the start of the Damage Step (without damage calculation).

*   The ① Trigger Effect is OPTIONAL.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 1 - Start of the Damage Step (before face-down monsters are flipped face-up). A face-down Flip Monster that is attacked is returned without activating its effect.
    *   This effect does not target the opponent's monster.

  
## NEO-SPACIAN TWINKLE MOSS

## NEWDORIA

*   This effect targets 1 monster.
*   You can destroy a face-down monster with "Newdoria".

  
## NEX

*   You cannot activate "NEX" if there is no Fusion Monster in your Extra Deck with the same name as a "Neo-Spacian" monster you control.
*   If "Neo-Spacian Dark Panther" copies the name of "Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin", it can be sent to the Graveyard for "NEX", but no monster can be Special Summoned from your Extra Deck. "Neo-Spacian Dark Panther" is in the Graveyard, its name is no longer treated as "Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin", and there is no Fusion Monster whose name is or is treated as "Neo-Spacian Dark Panther".

  
## NEXT TO BE LOST

*   You can target a Limited monster with “Next to be Lost”, but you don’t search or shuffle your Deck. Essentially, there is no effect.
*   You cannot target a Token Monster with “Next to be Lost” because they cannot exist in your Deck.
*   If the target of “Next to be Lost” is flipped face-down in a chain, the effect of “Next to be Lost” disappears because you can no longer check the Monster Card’s name.
*   If the target of “Next to be Lost” is destroyed in a chain, the effect of “Next to be Lost” disappears.
*   If you target “Proto-Cyber Dragon” on your side of the field for “Next to be Lost”, you send a “Cyber Dragon” from your Deck to the Graveyard, not a “Proto-Cyber Dragon”.
*   You can target "Embodiment of Apophis" with "Next to be Lost", and a copy of "Embodiment of Apophis" will be sent from your Deck to your Graveyard.

  
## NIGHT ASSAILANT  
> ① FLIP: Select 1 monster on your opponent's side of the field and destroy it. ② When this card is sent directly from your hand to the Graveyard, return 1 Flip Effect Monster from your Graveyard to your hand.

*   The ① Flip Effect is mandatory.
    *   This effect targets 1 (face-up / face-down) monster your opponent controls.
    *   This effect activates even if your opponent doesn't control a monster.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect targets 1 Flip Monster (except itself) in your Graveyard. It is negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   This effect activates whether this card was sent to the Graveyard as a cost or by an effect.
    *   If your opponent has your "Night Assailant" in hand (by"Exchange") and it is sent to the Graveyard, you (its owner) activate this effect.

  
## NIGHTMARE ARCHFIENDS

*   “Remove Brainwashing” will cause “Nightmare Archfiend Tokens” to switch to the control of the player who activated “Nightmare Archfiends”. If that player does not have enough available Monster Card Zone spaces, the extra “Nightmare Archfiend Tokens” are destroyed and the opponent takes damage accordingly. When a “Nightmare Archfiend Token” is destroyed, the effect to inflict damage does not start a chain, so cards like “Barrel Behind the Door” cannot be activated. Tributing a monster is a cost to activate this card.

  
## NIGHTMARE WHEEL

*   You can target a face-down monster for "Nightmare Wheel".
*   If you activate "Nightmare Wheel" during the Battle Step and target a monster that is attacking, the attack stops.
*   "Nightmare Wheel" targets. You select the monster when "Nightmare Wheel" is activated.
*   "Nightmare Wheel" is destroyed when the targeted monster is destroyed, returned to the hand, removed from play, send to the Graveyard, etc.
*   "Nightmare Wheel" is NOT destroyed if the monster is flipped face-down. "Nightmare Wheel" continues to target the monster, inflict damage, and prevent the monster from attacking or changing battle position.
*   If a face-down monster targeted by the effect of “Nightmare Wheel” is rearranged by the effect of “Wandering Mummy” or “Shifting Shadows”, the monster’s controller must honestly announce which monster is the target of “Nightmare Wheel”.
*   The effect of "Nightmare Wheel" will be negated by "Royal Decree", so you can attack or change the battle position of the monster. Also, if "Royal Decree" is active, and the monster is removed from the field, "Nightmare Wheel" remains on the field meaninglessly because its text that would destroy it is negated. If "Royal Decree" is later destroyed, the effects of "Nightmare Wheel" are not applied (such as the 500 damage) if there is no monster being targeted by "Nightmare Wheel".
*   The effect of "Nightmare Wheel" is still applied if the targeted monster changes sides.
*   If the monster targeted by "Nightmare Wheel" becomes equipped to "Relinquished", then "Nightmare Wheel" is destroyed.

  
## NIGHTMARE'S STEELCAGE

*   The effect of “Nightmare’s Steelcage” can be negated by “Dark Balter the Terrible”. It will remain on the field without effect until the opponent’s 2nd End Phase after it was activated.
*   If you use “Magic Reflector” to put a counter on “Nightmare’s Steelcage”, it is still destroyed during the opponent’s 2nd End Phase after it was activated. You cannot remove the counter instead.
*   “Nightmare’s Steelcage” prevents both players from attacking.

  
## NIGHT'S END SORCERER

*   "Night's End Sorcerer"'s effect can be activated when it is Special Summoned during the Damage Step.
*   "Night's End Sorcerer"'s effect cannot be activated when it is Special Summoned face-down (with "The Shallow Grave", etc.).

  
## NIGHT WING SORCERESS

*   If you activate “Assault Mode Activate” the turn it is Set, and a chain occurs that destroys “Night Wing Sorceress”, “Assault Mode Activate” still resolves.

  
## NIMBLE MOMONGA

*   The owner of "Nimble Momonga" activates its effect because it activates in its owner's Graveyard.
*   Gaining Life Points is mandatory, but Special Summoning "Nimble Momonga" from the Deck is not. You Special Summon the "Nimble Momonga" when you gain the Life Points.

  
## NINJA GRANDMASTER SASUKE

*   "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke"’s effect activates at the beginning of the Damage Step, before the monster is flipped face-up. So if "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke" attacks a face-down Defense Position monster, "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke" will not destroy it with his effect because it is not flipped face-up until after "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke"’s effect would activate.
*   A face-up Defense Position "Spirit Reaper" will be destroyed by the effect of "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke". "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke"’s effect does not target. So if "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke" attacks "Spirit Reaper", "Spirit Reaper" is destroyed by "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke"’s effect, not by "Spirit Reaper"’s effect.
*   If "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke" attacks a face-up Defense Position "D. D. Warrior Lady", "D. D. Warrior Lady" is destroyed by the effect of "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke" and "D. D. Warrior Lady"’s effect is not activated.
*   If "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke" attacks a face-up Defense Position monster, and you flip it face-down during the Battle Step with "Book of Moon", the monster is face-down at the start of the Damage Step so "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke" will not destroy it with his effect.
*   If "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke" attacks a face-down Defense Position monster, and "Ceasefire" is activated during the Battle Step, the monster is face-up at the start of the Damage Step so it will be destroyed by "Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke"’s effect.

  
## NINJITSU ART OF DECOY

*   If the Ninja is destroyed or otherwise removed from the field by a card effect, "Ninjitsu Art of Decoy" remains on the field meaninglessly.
*   If the Ninja is removed from the field temporarily, or flipped face-down, "Ninjitsu Art of Decoy"’s effect is no longer applied.
*   If "Ninjitsu Art of Decoy" is active, then "Royal Decree" is activated and negates "Ninjitsu Art of Decoy"’s effect, then "Royal Decree" is later destroyed, "Ninjitsu Art of Decoy"’s effect is not re-applied.

  
## NINJITSU ART OF TRANSFORMATION

*   "Ninjitsu Art of Transformation" does not target; you select the monster to Special Summon when you resolve its effect.
*   If "The Legendary Ocean" is active, your WATER monsters in your hand are lowered by 1 level so if you Special Summon from your hand using "Ninjitsu Art of Transformation", you can Summon at 1 level lower (effectively making it Level +4 if looking at the original Level).
*   "The selected card" means the Tributed card.

  
## NITRO UNIT

*   If you equip “Nitro Unit” to a monster on your opponent’s side of the field, then you take control of that monster, “Nitro Unit” is destroyed because the monster is no longer on your opponent’s side of the field.
*   If your opponent controls your monster, and you target it with “Nitro Unit”, but your opponent chains “Remove Brainwashing”, “Nitro Unit” is destroyed because its target is no longer on your opponent’s side of the field when “Nitro Unit” resolves.
*   When the monster equipped with “Nitro Unit” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle, the effect of “Nitro Unit” can be chained to.
*   The damage inflicted by “Nitro Unit” is based on the equipped monster’s original ATK (in the Graveyard).

  
## NITRO WARRIOR  
> ① Once during each of your turns, if you activated a Spell Card, this card gains 1000 ATK during its next attack, for damage calculation only. ② Once per turn, if this attacking card destroys an opponent's monster by battle, you can change 1 face-up Defense Position monster your opponent controls to Attack Position, and attack it with this card.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.
    *   If the Spell Card was activated before "Nitro Warrior" was Summoned, this effect does not apply.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   This effect targets a face-up Defense Position monster your opponent controls.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down / leaves the field, you do not make a second attack.
    *   You only gain 1 additional attack with this effect. "Mirror Force" can be activated in response to that additional attack, and if "Toll" is active you must pay 500 Life Points.

  
## NO ENTRY!!

*   Monsters in face-down Attack Position as a result of “Darkness Approaches” will be shifted into face-down Defense Position with the effect of “No Entry!!”.

  
## NOBLEMAN OF CROSSOUT  
> ① Destroy 1 face-down monster and remove it from play. If the monster is a Flip Effect Monster, both players must remove from play all monsters from their Decks with the same name as the destroyed monster.

*   The ① effect targets a face-down monster anywhere on the field.
    *   If the target is not destroyed, it is not removed from play, nor are any cards in the Deck(s).
    *   If the target is not face-down, it is not destroyed and no cards are removed from play.
    *   If the target is destroyed, and it was a Flip Effect Monster, you and your opponent MUST briefly show each other your Decks to verify that all copies of that Monster Card have been removed \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=822229)\].
        *   This cannot take place using online duel simulators, as it allows opportunity for foul play.
*   VS. "Imperial Iron Wall": Nobleman CANNOT be activated while IWW is active. If IWW is chained to Nobleman, the target is still destroyed but it is not removed from play, nor are any cards in the Deck(s).

  
## NOBLEMAN OF EXTERMINATION  
> ① Destroy 1 face-down Spell or Trap Card and remove it from play. If the card is a Trap Card, both players must check their respective Decks and remove all cards of the same name from play. Then shuffle the Decks.

*   The ① effect targets a face-down Spell / Trap Card anywhere on the field.
    *   You can target a face-down monster that is equipped to "Relinquished".
    *   If the target is not destroyed, it is not removed from play, nor are any cards in the Deck(s).
    *   If the target is not face-down, it is not destroyed and no cards are removed from play.
    *   If the target is destroyed, and it was a Trap Card, you and your opponent MUST briefly show each other your Decks to verify that all copies of that Trap Card have been removed \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=822229)\].

## NOBLEMAN-EATER BUG

*   If you activate the effect of "Nobleman-Eater Bug" and select 2 monsters, then "Ring of Destruction" is chained and destroys 1 of the selected monsters, you still destroy the remaining monster when "Nobleman-Eater Bug"’s effect resolves.
*   If "Nobleman-Eater Bug" is the only monster on the field and it is flipped face-up, then it destroys itself with its effect.

  
## NOISY GNAT

*   "Noisy Gnat"'s effect is an Ignition Effect. Sending "Noisy Gnat" to the Graveyard is a cost.
*   "Noisy Gnat"'s effect targets 1 face-up monster.

  
## NON AGGRESSION AREA

*   If your opponent Flip Summons "Cyber Jar" while "Non-Aggression Area" is active, because he cannot Special Summon, the cards he would normally Summon that were picked up are destroyed. All the cards picked up with "Cyber Jar" that would not normally be Special Summoned (such as high-level monsters, Spell and Trap Cards, and monsters that are Special Summon-only) remain in the hand and are not destroyed.
*   If you activate "Non-Aggression Area", your opponent can still Special Summon THIS turn with "Call of the Haunted", etc.

  
## NON-FUSION AREA

*   You cannot activate “Power Bond”, “Miracle Fusion”, or “Dragon’s Mirror” when this card is active because they are treated as Fusion Summons. You can activate “Fusion Gate”, but you cannot activate its effect.
*   You can still Special Summon a Fusion Monster with a card effect like “Metamorphosis” or “Cyber-Stein”.

  
## NON-SPELLCASTING AREA

*   While "Non-Spellcasting Area" is active, you cannot use face-up monsters on the field, except Effect Monsters, for "Polymerization" or Ritual Spell Cards.
*   While "Non-Spellcasting Area" is active, no Spell Card, including "Raigeki" or Equip Spell Cards, can affect a monster, unless it is an Effect Monster.
*   While "Non-Spellcasting Area" is active, and only one player has Effect Monsters on the field, you can activate “Creature Swap” but its effect will be negated because none of the non-Effect Monsters can switch control due to a Spell Card’s effect.
*   The effect of “Non-Spellcasting Area” includes Ritual Monsters and Fusion Monsters that do not have effects, as well as Monster Tokens.

  
## NUBIAN GUARD

*   "Nubian Guard"'s effect is resolved after damage calculation.
*   "Nubian Guard"'s effect does target a monster in the Graveyard, so the effect will be negated if "The End of Anubis" is face-up on the field.

  
## NULL AND VOID

*   You can only chain "Null and Void" to an effect that draws cards and does nothing else. You can chain "Null and Void" to the activation of "Pot of Greed" or "Jar of Greed". You can chain "Null and Void" to the activation of the effect of cards like "Airknight Parshath".
*   You can chain "Null and Void" to a Continuous Spell or Trap Card that causes drawing, such as "Mirage of Nightmare" or "Heart of the Underdog".
*   You cannot chain "Null and Void" to "Disturbance Strategy", "Graceful Charity", "Card Destruction", "Morphing Jar", "Mind Wipe", "Dragged Down into the Grave", or "Reload".
*   You can activate "Null and Void" during the Damage Step, for example against the effects of "Airknight Parshath", "Sasuke Samurai #3" or "Bistro Butcher".
*   The card(s) discarded by the effect of "Null and Void" are never treated as actually drawn, so they are considered sent from the Deck to the Graveyard.
*   You can chain "Null and Void" to "Reckless Greed". Since you cannot draw by the effect of "Reckless Greed", the effect of skipping 2 Draw Phases is NOT applied.
*   You can chain "Null and Void" to the effect of "Royal Magical Library".
*   You cannot chain "Null and Void" to the effect of "Appropriate" because the effect of "Appropriate" cannot be chained to.

  
## NUMINOUS HEALER

*   You cannot activate "Numinous Healer" when you pay a cost. You can only activate it when you receive Battle Damage or damage from an effect.

  
## NURSE REFICULE THE FALLEN ONE (erratum: "Darklord Nurse Reficule")  
> ① Any effect that would cause your opponent to gain Life Points instead inflicts the same amount of damage to your opponent.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies when effects that cause your opponent to gain Life Points resolve.
    *   This effect causes those effects to inflict Effect Damage.
    *   This is not the same as losing Life Points (ex: "Immortal of Thunder").
    *   This effect does not stack. Two copies of "Nurse Reficule" will NOT cause "Upstart Goblin" to inflict 2000 points of Damage, it only converts the 1000 Life Point gain into 1000 points of damage \[[REF](http://web.archive.org/web/20080131140306/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/COMMUNITY/forums/thread/1005905.aspx)\].
*   VS. "Prime Material Dragon": if both "Nurse Reficule" and "Prime Material Dragon" are on the field when Player A's "Upstart Goblin" resolves, Player B will gain 1000 Life Points (gains / damage happen normally) \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=808154)\].

  
## NUTRIENT Z

*   This card can only be activated during your opponent’s Damage Step during the "Calculate and Apply Damage" portion or at any point in the Damage Step prior to that.
*   You must take the 2000 points or more of Battle Damage from a single attack. If you take 1000 points of damage from one attack, and then 1200 points of damage from a second attack, the effect of this card will not activate.
*   If "Hayabusa Knight" attacks you directly twice, the effect of this card will not activate. The Battle Damage must come from a single attack, not a single monster attacking twice.
*   You can activate 2 copies of "Nutrient Z" and you will gain 8000 Life Points if you would take 2000 points or more of Battle Damage.
*   You cannot activate "Kuriboh" in a chain to "Nutrient Z"’s effect. The effect of "Kuriboh" would reduce the Battle Damage to 0, and then the effect of "Nutrient Z" will no longer increase you Life Points. You must actually take the damage to gain the benefit of "Nutrient Z"’s effect.

  
## NUVIA THE WICKED

*   If "Light of Intervention" is on the field this card cannot be Set and if Normal Summoned in face-up Defense Position it will be destroyed.

  
## OBELISK THE TORMENTOR  
> Ⓒ You must Tribute 3 monsters to Normal Summon this card (you cannot Set this card). Ⓤ The Normal Summon of this card cannot be negated. ① When this card is Normal Summoned, Spells, Traps, and Effect Monster effects cannot be activated. ② This card cannot be targeted by the effects of Spells, Traps, or Effect Monsters. ③ If this card is Special Summoned, it is sent to the Graveyard during the End Phase. ④ You can Tribute 2 monsters to destroy all monsters your opponent controls. (4C) This card cannot declare an attack the turn this effect is activated.

*   The Ⓒ Summon Condition cannot be negated.
    *   You can only Tribute Summon this card by Tributing 3 monsters.
    *   Obelisk can be Special Summoned by card effects.
*   The Ⓤ unclassified effect cannot be negated.
    *   This Normal (Tribute) Summon of this card cannot be negated by "Solemn Judgment".
    *   The Special Summon can be negated by "Royal Oppression".
*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   Spell / Trap Cards and their effects, as well as Monster Effects cannot be activated (ex: "Book of Eclipse", "Black Garden", "Skill Drain", "Torrential Tribute", "Strike Ninja") \[[REF](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Forum:Obelisk_the_Tormenter_vs._Black_Garden)\].
    *   VS. "Sangan" & "Ultimate Offering": If "Ultimate Offering" Tributes Sangan (and 2 monsters) to Normal Summon Obelisk as Chain Link 1, "Sangan" cannot activate its effect, since it would activate in the Summon response timing of Obelisk. If instead Obelisk is Summoned as Chain Link 2+, then "Sangan" can activate in a new Chain once the current one resolves completely
    *   When Obelisk is successfully Summoned, nothing can be done. Afterwards, the Turn Player enters an open game state and may Synchro Summon, Set a Spell / Trap Card, etc.
    *   This effect does not apply if Obelisk was Special Summoned.
*   The ② Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   Cards / Effects cannot target this card. If Obelisk is the only available target, they cannot be activated (ex: "Dimensional Prison", "Blaze Accelerator", "Dark Armed Dragon").
    *   Cards / Effects that do not target (ex: "Mirror Force", "Book of Eclipse") still affect Obelisk.
*   The ③ Trigger Effect activates once each End Phase while Obelisk remains face-up.
    *   This effect does not target Obelisk.
    *   If an effect is Chained that flipped Obelisk face-down, it is still sent to the Graveyard.
*   The ④ Ignition effect also has a condition attached that prevents Obelisk from attacking.
    *   Tributing two monsters is a cost.
    *   "Obelisk the Tormentor" may Tribute itself to activate its effect.
    *   If this activated effect was negated (by "Starlight Road"), the (4C) Condition will still apply.
    *   If the activation of this effect was negated (by "Divine Wrath"), the (4C) Condition does not apply.

  
## OBNOXIOUS CELTIC GUARD

*   "Obnoxious Celtic Guard" and "Celtic Guardian" are considered 2 separate monsters so you can have 3 of each in your Deck.
*   "Obnoxious Celtic Guard"’s effect looks at the ATK during Damage Calculation. So if he’s WIND and is attacked by "Insect Soldiers of the Sky", their ATK is 2000 during Damage Calculation and "Obnoxious Celtic Guard" is not destroyed. Or if an 1800 monster attacks and you use "Rush Recklessly" to increase the ATK to 2500 during the Damage Step, "Obnoxious Celtic Guardian" is not destroyed.
*   "Obnoxious Celtic Guard"’s effect looks at current ATK, not original ATK. So a monster with 1000 original ATK equipped with "Megamorph" to make it 2000 ATK will not destroy "Obnoxious Celtic Guard" as a result of battle.
*   "Obnoxious Celtic Guard" isn’t destroyed by damage calculation but can be destroyed by monster effects like "Ryu Kokki".
*   If "Obnoxious Celtic Guard" is attacked by "Dark Ruler Ha Des", or another monster that negates a card’s effect after it destroys it, "Obnoxious Celtic Guard" is not destroyed (so its effect is not negated).
*   "Obnoxious Celtic Guard"’s effect works for a battle caused by "Last Turn", so if it battles a monster with ATK 1900 or higher, neither is destroyed and the Duel is a draw.

  
## OBSIDIAN DRAGON

*   "Obsidian Dragon"'s effect is a Continuous Effect.
*   Equip Spell Cards equipped during a previous turn will be negated and destroyed by "Obsidian Dragon"'s effect.
*   When a Union Monster is equipped to a DARK monster you control, it is negated and destroyed by "Obsidian Dragon"'s effect after equipping to the DARK monster.
*   If you use "Snatch Steal" to take control of your opponent's DARK monster while you control "Obsidian Dragon", "Snatch Steal" is negated and destroyed, and the DARK monster is returned to your opponent.
*   If you use "Brain Control" to take control of your opponent's DARK monster while you control "Obsidian Dragon", the effect of "Brain Control" is not negated.

  
## OFFERING TO THE SNAKE DEITY

*   "Offering to the Snake Deity" targets 1 Reptile-Type monster you control and 2 cards your opponent controls.
*   If an effect chained to "Offering to the Snake Deity" removes 1 of the targeted cards from the field, "Offering to the Snake Deity"'s effect disappears.
*   If "Offering to the Snake Deity" targets a monster that is unaffected by the effects of Trap Cards, the other cards are still destroyed.

  
## OFFERING TO THE IMMORTALS

*   None of these effects target.
*   If you cannot Special Summon the “Ceremonial Tokens” you cannot add any of the listed cards to your hand.
*   Special Summoning the Tokens and adding 1 of the listed cards to your hand occur at the same time.
*   Even if your Life Points are greater than 3000 when “Offering to the Immortals” resolves, its effects are still applied.
*   If you don’t have at least 2 open Monster Card Zones or if you don’t have a card in your Deck that you can add to your hand you cannot activate “Offering to the Immortals.”

  
## OFFERINGS TO THE DOOMED

*   Skipping your next Draw Phase is not a cost, so if your opponent chains "Magic Jammer" or "Imperial Order" to negate this card, you do NOT skip your next Draw Phase.
*   If your opponent chains "Book of Moon" to flip the target of this card face-down, the monster is not destroyed and you will skip your next Draw Phase.

  
## OGRE OF SCARLET SORROW

*   This effect does not target.
*   If this card is Summoned and a replay occurs, your opponent can either choose to attack this card or choose not to attack with that monster.
*   If you have both “Ogre of the Scarlet Sorrow” and “Battle Fader” in your hand when your opponent declares their second direct attack, you can only activate the effect of one of them.
*   If you have two “Ogre of the Scarlet Sorrow” in your hand when your opponent declares their second direct attack, you can only activate the effect of one of them.
*   If “Skill Drain” is activated, the ATK/DEF of “Ogre of the Scarlet Sorrow” will become 0 and remain 0 even if “Skill Drain” is later destroyed.
*   If the first monster that attacked directly is no longer on the field, you can still Summon “Ogre of the Scarlet Sorrow” when your opponent declares a second direct attack. When you do, the effect to determine the ATK/DEF will result in an ATK/DEF of 0.
*   “Ogre of the Scarlet Sorrow” keeps its modified ATK/DEF as long as it remains face-up on the field.

  
## OILMAN  
> ① Once per turn, during your Main Phase, you can equip this card to a Machine-Type monster you control as an Equip Card, OR unequip it to Special Summon this card in face-up Attack Position. ② While equipped to a monster by this effect, if the equipped monster destroys an opponent's monster by battle, draw 1 card. Ⓒ (A monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the equipped monster would be destroyed, destroy this card instead.)

*   The effect to draw a card while “Oilman” is equipped starts a Chain.
*   Equipping “Oilman” is an Ignition Effect, and the effects while equipped are considered as effects of a Spell Card.

  
## OJAMA BLUE

*   You can’t activate the effect of “Ojama Blue” unless you have 2 “Ojama” cards in your Deck.

  
## OJAMA COUNTRY

*   “Ojamuscle” is considered to be an “Ojama” card, so you can send it from your hand to the Graveyard for the cost of the first effect. If you control “Ojamuscle” and it is a monster (for example, with “Magical Hats”), it is considered an “Ojama” monster for the second effect.
*   Sending an “Ojama” card to the Graveyard is a cost to activate “Ojama Country’s” Special Summon effect. It targets 1 “Ojama” monster in your Graveyard, and cannot be activated if there are no “Ojama” monsters in your Graveyard. If there is an “Ojama” monster in your Graveyard, you can discard an “Ojama” monster and Special Summon that same “Ojama” monster.
*   The ATK/DEF switch is applied to monsters controlled by both players. Only the controller of “Ojama Country” can activate its Special Summon effect.
*   If “Gladiator Beast Hoplomus” is Special Summoned by a Gladiator Beast while “Ojama Country” is active, it has 2400 original ATK and 700 original DEF.
*   The switched original ATK and DEF are considered the new original ATK and DEF.
*   If "Curse of Anubis" is activated while the effect of "Ojama Country" is already in effect, the switched original DEF (which used to be its original ATK) will be 0. If "Ojama Country” is activated while "Curse of Anubis" is already in effect, the 0
*   original DEF (from the effect of "Curse of Anubis") will be its original ATK, so the ATK will be 0.
*   Example: If “Ojama Country” is already active, and “Curse of Anubis” is activated, “Sangan” would have ATK 600 / DEF 0. While "Curse of Anubis" is already active, and "Ojama Country" is activated. Sangan would have ATK 0 / DEF 1000.

  
## OJAMA DELTA HURRICANE!!

*   If your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" or "Book of Moon" to "Ojama Delta Hurricane!!", and one of the Ojamas is destroyed or flipped face-down, "Ojama Delta Hurricane!!"'s effect still resolves.

  
## OJAMA KING

*   You cannot select occupied Monster Card Zones with "Ojama King"’s effect. If your opponent has 5 monsters on the field, then "Ojama King"’s effect is not applied.
*   "Ojama King"’s effect activates and you select up to 3 Monster Card Zones when "Ojama King" becomes face-up on the field.
*   If you select up to 3 Monster Card Zones and your "Ojama King" is flipped face-down, the Monster Card Zones are usable again. When "Ojama King" is flipped face-up again, you can select up to 3 Monster Card Zones again.
*   If you take control of your opponent’s face-up "Ojama King", you cannot select new Monster Card Zones because the zones are selected when "Ojama King" becomes face-up on the field.

  
## OJAMA KNIGHT

*   You can use Ojama Tokens as Fusion Material Monsters when you Summon this card.
*   If "Ojama Knight" is destroyed while "Centrifugal Field" is in play, you cannot Special Summon any monsters.

  
## OJAMA TRIO

*   You cannot activate "Ojama Trio" if there are not 3 vacant Monster Zones on your opponent's side of the field.
*   You cannot activate "Ojama Trio" if "Scapegoat" or "The Last Warrior from Another Planet" is preventing you from Summoning.
*   If there are Ojama Tokens on your opponent's side of the field, and "Remove Brainwashing" is activated, the Ojama Tokens are switched to your side of the field. If you don't have enough Monster Zones for them, some of the Ojama Tokens are destroyed and the damage is inflicted to the opponent.
*   When you chain Ojama Trio to your opponent's "Call of the Mummy" effect, the effect of "Call of the Mummy" is negated.
*   When your opponent activates "Snatch Steal", and you chain "Ojama Trio" to fill up his/her remaining Monster Zones, then there is no room for the stolen monster, and it is destroyed.

  
## OJAMAGIC

*   When you activate this card’s effect, and you find out that you do not have all 3 of “Ojama Green”, “Ojama Yellow”, and “Ojama Black” in your Deck, then you cannot add any of them to your hand. You must add all 3 or none. If you do not add all 3, your opponent may check your Deck to verify.
*   The effect of “Ojamagic” activates in the Graveyard, and it can be chained to. It cannot be negated by “Magic Jammer” or “Dark Balter the Terrible”.
*   Because the effect of “Ojamagic” is mandatory, it will activate even if it is sent to the Graveyard as the cost for another card, or in the middle of a chain.
*   Since a Spell Speed 1 effect cannot be chained to a Spell Speed 2 effect, and “Ojamagic” is a Normal Spell Cards, if “Ojamagic” is sent to the Graveyard simultaneously with a Spell Speed 2 card that activates in the Graveyard, like “Statue of the Wicked” or “Dark Coffin”, then “Ojamagic” is the first chain link, and the Trap Cards will be the second and third chain links.
*   If you select “Ojamagic” for the effect of “Ancient Gear Drill”, and it is destroyed that same turn, you cannot activate “Ojamagic’s” effect.

  
## OJAMUSCLE

*   This card’s effect lasts for as long as the selected “Ojama King” remains face-up on the field.
*   This card targets 1 face-up “Ojama King”. If “Book of Moon” is chained to flip the targeted “Ojama King” face-down all the other “Ojama” monsters are destroyed, but no ATK increase is given.
*   “Ojamuscle” is considered to be an “Ojama” card, so you can send it from your hand to the Graveyard for the cost of the first effect. If you control “Ojamuscle” and it is a monster (for example, with “Magical Hats”), it is considered an “Ojama” monster for the second effect.

  
## OMEGA GOGGLES

*   The effect to look at 1 random card in your opponent's hand is an Ignition Effect.
*   If "Omega Goggles" is unequipped from the monster after using its effect, the monster can attack during the turn.
*   If "Omega Goggles" is equipped to a monster that is unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards, after "Omega Goggles" uses its Ignition Effect, the equipped monster can still attack.
*   If control of the equipped monster switches to your opponent, "Omega Goggles" remains equipped to the monster.

  
## OMINOUS FORTUNETELLING

*   The opponent must reveal the randomly selected card to you after you call a type to confirm if you were right or wrong.
*   If the opponent’s hand is revealed by the effect of "Mind on Air", etc., turn his/her hand face-down and then randomly select a card.
*   If you have two copies of "Ominous Fortunetelling" on the field, you select a card and call a type for the first copy, and then select a new card and call a type again for the second copy.

  
## OPTI-CAMOUFLAGE ARMOR

*   After you have declared a direct attack with your monster equipped with "Opti-Camouflage Armor", and then the "Opti-Camouflage Armor" is destroyed during the attack, you can no longer attack directly and a replay occurs.

  
## OPTION HUNTER

*   If you send a monster to the Graveyard for “Option Hunter” that has undetermined ATK, you gain 0 Life Points. (“King of the Skull Servants”, “Megarock Dragon”, “Maju Garzett”, etc.)
*   “Option Hunter” does not target.

  
## ORACLE OF THE SUN

*   The effect to add “Fire Ant Ascator” or “Supay” to your hand activates even during the Damage Step.
*   If the ATK of “Oracle of the Sun” is being doubled by “Supay” and “Skill Drain” is activated, the ATK remains doubled.
*   When you Special Summon “Oracle of the Sun” with the effect of “Supay” it is Special Summoned with 2000 ATK. Then you apply any bonuses from Field Spells or continuous effects.

  
## ORCA MEGA-FORTRESS OF DARKNESS

*   You can Tribute a face-down "Torpedo Fish" or "Cannonball Spear Shellfish" to activate "Orca Mega-Fortress of Darkness"' effect.

  
## ORDEAL OF A TRAVELER

*   You can activate the effect of "Ordeal of a Traveler" each time your opponent attacks.
*   You must show the card your opponent selects to your opponent.
*   If your opponent calls it right, the attack resolves normally.
*   You cannot activate "Ordeal of a Traveler"’s effect if you have no cards in your hand.
*   When "Ordeal of a Traveler" & "Fairy Box" are both active, "Fairy Box" (mandatory) is step 1 of the chain, and "Ordeal of a Traveler" (optional) is step 2.
*   When you activate "Ordeal of a Traveler"’s effect as a chain to "Magic Cylinder", since "Ordeal of a Traveler" resolves first, if your opponent guesses incorrectly then the attack does not resolve and the effect of "Magic Cylinder" disappears. If multiple copies of "Ordeal of a Traveler" are active, their effects are cumulative.

  
## ORDER TO SMASH

*   You Tribute when you resolve "Order to Smash"'s effect.
*   You select the Spell/Trap Card when you resolve "Order to Smash"'s effect.

  
## OUTSTANDING DOG MARRON

*   When "Outstanding Dog Marron" is sent to the Graveyard during a chain, its effect is activated after the current chain resolves (just like "Witch of the Black Forest").
*   When "Mystical Knight of Jackal" attacks "Outstanding Dog Marron" and destroys it, the effects are simultaneous. So "Mystical Knight of Jackal"'s effect is Step 1 of a chain and "Outstanding Dog Marron" is Step 2. "Outstanding Dog Marron" is returned to the Deck and "Mystical Knight of Jackal"'s effect disappears.

  
## OVER DESTINY

*   If the monster targeted by "Over Destiny" is removed from your Graveyard by an effect on the chain, you cannot Special Summon a monster.
*   If the Level of the monster targeted by "Over Destiny" is odd, round down.

  
## OVER LIMIT

*   “Over Limit” cannot be activated if there are no Normal Monsters with 1000 or less ATK in the Graveyard that were destroyed in battle during the turn.
*   If a Normal Monster with 1000 or less ATK that was destroyed in battle is removed from the Graveyard and later in the same turn it is returned to the Graveyard by other means (Tributed, etc.), it cannot be Special Summoned with “Over Limit”.

  
## OVERDRIVE TELEPORTER  
> Ⓒ This card cannot be Special Summoned. ① You can pay 2000 Life Points to Special Summon 2 Level 3 Psychic-Type monsters from your Deck. This effect can only be used once while this card is face-up on the field.

*   The Ⓒ Summoning Condition is not an effect. It cannot be negated.
*   The ① Ignition Effect can only be activated during your Main Phase.
    *   Paying 2000 Life Points is a cost.
    *   This effect Special Summons 2 monsters simultaneously. You cannot Summon only 1.
    *   If this effect's activation is negated, it still cannot be activated while it is still face-up.
    *   You MUST have 2(+) Level 3 Psychic-Type monsters in your Deck to activate this effect.

  
## OVERDOOM LINE

*   The ATK boost of “Overdoom Line” starts a Chain, but does not target.
*   The text on “Overdoom Line” that destroys itself is not an effect, so “Royal Decree” etc. will not stop it from being destroyed.
*   Plants that were Special Summoned before the activation of “Overdoom Line” do not receive an ATK boost when “Overdoom Line” is activated.
*   Monsters that get an ATK boost from “Overdoom Line” keep the boost even if they become a Type other than Plant-Type.
*   If a monster receives the ATK boost from “Overdoom Line” but is flipped face-down, it loses the boost, even if flipped face-up again while “Overdoom Line” is still on the field.
*   You cannot activate “Overdoom Line” during the Damage Step.
*   While “Imperial Custom” is active, “Overdoom Line” cannot destroy itself, so it will remain on the field. Its effect will also remain.

  
## OVERLOAD FUSION

*   "Overload Fusion" does not target. You select and remove the monsters during resolution.

  
## OVERWHELM  
> Activate only while you control a face-up Level 7 or higher monster that was Tribute Summoned. Negate the activation of a Trap Card or Effect Monster's effect and destroy that card.  
  

*   You must control a face-up Level 7(+) monster that was Tribute Summoned to activate this card.
    *   You cannot activate this card if your Tribute Summoned monster Level is treated as Level 6 (or lower) by "Level Eater", even if its original (printed) Level is 7(+).
    *   You cannot activate this card if you Normal Summoned a Level 7(+) monster using the effect of "Mausoleum of the Emperor".
*   This effect negates the activation of a Trap Card (when it is played face-up).
    *   This card cannot negate the activated effect of "Skill Successor" in the Graveyard.
*   This effect negates the activation of an activated Effect Monster's effect in any location.
    *   If this card negates the activated effect of "Elemental Hero Absolute Zero" in the Extra Deck, it destroys it in the Extra Deck and sends it to the Graveyard.

  
## OXYGEDDON

*   This card’s effect is a Trigger Effect. It can be chained to with “Barrel Behind the Door”.

  
## OYSTER MEISTER

*   If "Oyster Meister" is Tributed to Summon "Kuraz the Light Monarch" and Kuraz' effect is activated, "Oyster Meister"'s effect is Chain Link 1 and "Kuraz the Light Monarch"'s effect is Chain Link 2.


## PALADIN OF CURSED DRAGON  
> ① Once per turn, you can Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower Zombie-Type monster that was destroyed by battle from your opponent's Graveyard to your side of the field.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect targets a Zombie-Type monster in your opponent's Graveyard.
    *   If the target is no longer a Zombie-Type when this effect resolves, it is not Special Summoned.
    *   This effect can Summon a monster affected by "Zombie World", even if the monster was not Zombie-Type when it was destroyed by battle.
    *   When a monster Summoned by "Paladin of the Cursed Dragon" is destroyed by battle, you can Special Summon it again with "Paladin of the Cursed Dragon"'s effect.

  
## PANDABORG

*   Paying 800 Life Points is a cost. If you have no open Monster Card Zones when this effect resolves, you cannot Special Summon a monster from your Deck and your opponent cannot check your Deck.

  
## PANDEMONIUM

*   You can't use "Pandemonium" to add a Fusion Monster Archfiend or Synchro Monster Archfiend from the Extra Deck to your hand, like "Fiend Skull Dragon" or "Red Dragon Archfiend".
*   If multiple Archfiends are destroyed at the same time by "Raigeki", you can only add 1 Archfiend from your Deck to your hand with "Pandemonium".
*   When your Archfiends controlled by your opponent are sent to your Graveyard, you can add an Archfiend from your Deck to your hand with "Pandemonium".

  
## PANDEMONIUM WATCHBEAR

*   When your opponent activates "Huge Revolution" while your "Pandemonium Watchbear" is on your side of the field, your "Pandemonium" will not be destroyed.
*   When your "Pandemonium" is going to be destroyed by "Mystical Space Typhoon", you can chain "Ceasefire" to flip your "Pandemonium Watchbear" face-up, and "Pandemonium" will not be destroyed.

  
## PARALYZING CHAIN

*   "Paralyzing Chain"'s effect is a Trigger Effect.

  
## PARRY

*   The “Gladiator Beast” monster returned to the Deck is returned to the Deck when “Parry” is resolved. It is not a cost. You must show the “Gladiator Beast” to your opponent when resolving “Parry’s” effect.
*   You cannot activate “Parry” if you do not have a “Gladiator Beast” monster in your hand.

  
## PATRICIAN OF DARKNESS

*   For this card’s effect, the chosen attack target must still be legal. You cannot force a monster to attack directly if it normally cannot, or force a monster to attack a monster on its own side of the field.
*   The effect of "Patrician of Darkness" does not override the effects of "Marauding Captain", "The Legendary Fisherman", "Solar Flare Dragon", etc. You cannot choose an attack target prevented by the effects of these cards. Examples: You cannot choose "The Legendary Fisherman" as an attack target if "Umi" is on the field. You cannot choose another Warrior-Type monster as an attack target when you control "Marauding Captain".
*   "Inaba White Rabbit" must still attack your Life Points directly since it is not able to attack other monsters. You cannot force it to with this card’s effect.
*   If a monster has the optional effect of attacking directly, such as "Rainbow Flower", you may choose a monster as an attack, or a direct attack.
*   When you control "Patrician of Darkness" and a monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" you must chose the equipped monster as the attack target.
*   Replays may occur as normal when this card is on the field. If, after the replay, "Patrician of Darkness" is still on the field and they choose to restart the attack, you will still choose the attack target with the effect of "Patrician of Darkness".
*   If you control "Patrician of Darkness" and "Lord of D." you may still choose Dragon-Type monsters on your side of the field as attack targets.

  
## PATROID

*   The effect of “Patroid” targets a card.
*   If “Patroid” is flipped face-down or removed from the field, its effect is reset and you can use it again that turn if you can get it face-up on the field again.

  
## PENALTY GAME!

*   "Penalty Game!" only requires your opponent to have 4 cards in hand when it is activated, not when it resolves. So your opponent can activate "Jar of Greed" to have 5 cards, or chain a Quick-Play Spell Card from his hand and have 3 cards, and "Penalty Game!" will still resolve.
*   If you choose the first effect, neither player can activate a card that would require the opponent to draw during their next Draw Phase, such as "Jar of Greed" or "Disturbance Strategy".
*   If the second effect of "Penalty Game!" is chosen, the opponent can still activate the effects of cards that are already face-up on the field, such as "Skull Lair" or "The Dragon’s Bead".

  
## PENGUIN SOLDIER

*   You may choose to return 0, 1, or 2 monsters to their owners’ hands.
*   You may target Monster Tokens, and they will be taken off the field, instead of returning to the hand.
*   Spirit Monsters can still be returned to their owners’ hands by the effect of "Penguin Soldier" even if "Spiritual Energy Settle Machine" is in play.

  
## PENUMBRAL SOLDIER LADY

*   "Penumbral Soldier Lady"’s ATK increases during the Damage Step and this effect can be chained to.
*   "Penbumbral Soldier Lady"’s ATK increases when appropriate, no matter whose turn it is or whether she attacked or was attacked.
*   The increase to "Penumbral Soldier Lady’s" ATK from her effect only lasts until the end of the Damage Step.

  
## PETEN THE DARK CLOWN

*   Missing the Timing: “Peten the Dark Clown” is a “when… you can” optional Trigger Effect. This means that “Peten” being sent to the Graveyard has to be the very last thing that happened in order to activate its effect.
*   If “Peten the Dark Clown” is Tributed for a Tribute Summon, the last thing that happened was that a monster was Summoned, so the effect of “Peten” does not activate.
*   If “Peten the Dark Clown” is Tributed for “Mystik Wok” or “Cannon Soldier”, the last thing that happened was that those effects resolved, so the effect of “Peten” does not activate.
*   If “Peten the Dark Clown” is destroyed in a chain and not as Chain Link 1, his effect does not activate. (Example: “Pot of Greed” is activated and “Ring of Destruction” is chained, targeting “Peten”.)
*   If “Peten the Dark Clown” is destroyed by “Cyber Jar”, the last thing that happened was that monsters were Summoned to the field, so the effect of “Peten” does not activate.
*   If “Peten the Dark Clown” is discarded as a cost for “Tribe-Infecting Virus” or “Raigeki Break”, the last thing that happened was that those effects resolved, so the effect of “Peten” does not activate.
*   If “Peten the Dark Clown” is discarded because of “Morphing Jar” or “Card Destruction”, the last thing that happened was that both players drew cards. So the effect of “Peten” does not activate.
*   If “Peten the Dark Clown” is sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle, or by “Painful Choice”, the last thing that happened WAS that “Peten” was sent to the Graveyard, so his effect will activate.

  
## PHANTOM CRICKET

*   This card’s effect targets 1 face-down monster.
*   If the targeted monster is flipped face-up by an effect chained to this card’s effect, it will not be returned to the top of its owner’s Deck.

  
## PHANTOM DRAGON

*   You cannot Summon "Phantom Dragon" if you do not have 2 Monster Card Zones that you can make unusable. However, "Phantom Dragon" can be Set or Special Summoned face-down when you do not have 2 Monster Card Zones to make unusable.
*   You cannot activate "Phantom Dragon"'s effect during the Damage Step.
*   If a face-down "Phantom Dragon" is flipped face-up, you will select 2 Monster Card Zones to make unusable. If none can be selected, the next 2 Monster Card Zones to become available will be made unusable.
*   "Phantom Dragon" can be Tribute Summoned if the Tributed monsters will create 2 Monster Card Zones that can be made unusable.
*   2 "Phantom Dragons" cannot select the same Monster Card Zones to make unusable.
*   Once a Monster Card Zone is chosen, you cannot change your choice to a different Monster Card Zone later in the Duel.
*   If you have 1 face-up "Phantom Dragon" while "Skill Drain" is active, when your opponent Special Summons a monster you can Special Summon another "Phantom Dragon" into one of the Monster Card Zones that was made unusable by the negated "Phantom Dragon".
*   If you take control of your opponent's "Phantom Dragon", you will select 2 Monster Card Zones on your side of the field to make unusable. If you do not have any available, the next 2 Monster Card Zones to become available will be made unusable.

  
## PHANTOM OF CHAOS  
> ① Any Battle Damage this monster inflicts to your opponent becomes 0. ② Once per turn, you can remove from play 1 Effect Monster in your Graveyard. Until the End Phase, this card's name is treated as that monster's name, and it gains that monster's effect(s) and ATK.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies so long as this card is face-up on the field.
*   The ② Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect targets 1 Effect Monster in your Graveyard.
    *   You cannot target a non-effect monster, nor can you target a Gemini monster.
    *   The target is removed from play when this effect resolves.
    *   If this effect removes the target from play",Phantom of Chaos" gains its name, ATK, and effect(s).
    *   "Phantom of Chaos" will not gain the category of TUNER, etc. \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=634429)\], nor will it gain any Conditions (ex: if "Debris Dragon" is copied, you CAN use "Phantom of Chaos" for the Synchro Summon of a non-Dragon-Type Synchro Monster, the other Synchro Material Monsters may be Level 4) \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=765037)\].
    *   If the target is removed from play before this effect resolves, "Phantom of Chaos" does not gain any traits of the target, nor can it activate its effect again that turn \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/78184-phantom-of-chaosddcrownorleras/&tab=comments)\].
    *   You decide when this lingering effect expires during the End Phase (like with "Brain Control").
    *   VS. "Relinquished": If "Phantom of Chaos" copies the name, ATK, and effects of "Relinquished" and equips an opponent's monster, the equipped monster is destroyed during the End Phase \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=501711&page=2)\].
    *   VS. "Prohibition": if a card is named, and later "Phantom of Chaos" copied its name, ATK, and effects, then it cannot attack, change its Battle Position, etc.
    *   VS. "Skill Drain": If you use "Phantom of Chaos'" effect to copy the name, ATK, and effect(s) of a DARK monster and afterwards "Skill Drain" is activated, the copied effect(s) are negated, but the copied name and ATK are not negated. If you activate "Phantom of Chaos'" effect and "Skill Drain" is chained, the target is not removed from play, and the effect resolves negated.

  
## PHANTOM SKYBLASTER  
> ① When you Normal or Flip Summon this card, you can Special Summon any number of "Skyblaster Tokens" (Fiend-Type/DARK/Level 4/ATK 500/DEF 500), but not more than the number of monsters you control. ② During your Standby Phase, you can inflict 300 damage to your opponent for each "Skyblaster" monster you control. If you activate this effect, "Skyblaster" monsters you control cannot attack this turn.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect must Special Summon at least 1 "Skyblaster Token".
    *   If you control no monsters when this effect resolves, no Tokens are Special Summoned.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect only inflicts damage for your face-up "Skyblaster" monsters.
    *   "Skyblaster" monsters Summoned later in the turn also cannot attack.
    *   If this effect is activated, your "Skyblaster" monsters cannot attack this turn.
    *   If this effect is negated (by "Skill Drain"), your "Skyblaster" monsters cannot attack this turn.
    *   If the activation of this effect is negated (by "Divine Wrath"), your "Skyblaster" monsters can attack this turn.

  
## PHARAOH'S TREASURE

*   You cannot select the "Pharaoh’s Treasure" you just drew and sent to the Graveyard as the card to place in your hand.
*   You can select a face-up "Pharaoh’s Treasure" in your deck as 1 of the 5 cards for "Painful Choice", but because "Painful Choice" is not a draw, the effect of "Pharaoh’s Treasure" will not be activated.
*   If you take "Pharaoh’s Treasure" from your opponent’s hand with "Exchange" and activate it, the card goes in your Deck, not the original owner’s Deck. When you draw your opponent’s "Pharaoh’s Treasure" from your Deck after that, the controller gets the effect of "Pharaoh’s Treasure" and retrieves a card from his Graveyard, but "Pharaoh’s Treasure" goes to the owner’s Graveyard.
*   If "Convulsion of Nature" is active, place "Pharaoh’s Treasure" face-down so that it is the opposite direction of the rest of the cards.
*   If a face-up "Pharaoh’s Treasure" is in your deck and "Fiber Jar" is activated, shuffle the Deck with "Pharaoh’s Treasure" in it; if you draw the "Pharaoh’s Treasure" in your new 5-card hand, the effect is activated but because there are no cards in the Graveyard to retrieve, its effect disappears.
*   If you pick up a face-up "Pharaoh’s Treasure" because of "Cyber Jar", this is not drawing so the effect is not activated; you may Set the "Pharaoh’s Treasure" you picked up and activate it again (placing it back into your Deck, etc.).
*   You cannot activate "Seven Tools of the Bandit" or "Solemn Judgment" when "Pharaoh’s Treasure" is drawn.
*   You can select a face-up "Pharaoh’s Treasure" from your Deck for "Different Dimension Capsule"; the "Pharaoh’s Treasure" is removed from play and kept face-down until the time elapses, at which point it is added to your hand, but it was not drawn so its effect does not activate.
*   You can select a face-up "Pharaoh’s Treasure" from your deck with "Cat of Ill Omen"; if "Necrovalley" is not on the field, the "Pharaoh’s Treasure" is placed face-up on top of your Deck and will activate its effect when drawn.
*   If you have no vacant Spell and Trap Zone spaces when you draw "Pharaoh’s Treasure", you still get the effect of "Pharaoh’s Treasure" because you don’t have to put it on the field.
*   After "Pharaoh’s Treasure" is placed face-up in the Deck, "Jinzo" will not negate its effect when drawn.
*   If "Drop Off" is used when a face-up "Pharaoh’s Treasure" is drawn, "Pharaoh’s Treasure" is discarded and its effect disappears.
*   If you draw a face-up "Pharaoh’s Treasure" with "Graceful Charity", you miss the timing for the effect of "Pharaoh’s Treasure" and the effect disappears. "Pharaoh’s Treasure" is simply added to your hand. In order to apply the effect of "Pharaoh’s Treasure", the very last action must have been to draw. You CAN apply Pharaoh’s Treasure’s effect if it is drawn while face-up due to "Pot of Greed", "Fiber Jar", etc.
*   If "Pharaoh's Treasure" is drawn from your Deck (face-up) while "Banisher of the Light" is in play, "Pharaoh's Treasure" is removed from play and its effect does not activate.
*   You select the card in your Graveyard that you wish to add to your hand when "Pharaoh's Treasure" is drawn and activates it effect, so your opponent can chain AFTER you have announced which card you wish to retrieve.

  
## PHOENIX WING WIND BLAST  
> Discard 1 card. Return 1 card your opponent controls to the top of the Deck.

*   Discarding 1 card is a cost. This can be activated while "Macro Cosmos" is active.
*   This effect targets 1 (face-up / face-down) card your opponent controls.
*   You can activate “Phoenix Wing Wind Blast” and target a face-up “Swords of Revealing Light” because it destroys itself by its own effect, instead of being destroyed when activated, like most Normal Spell Cards.
*   You cannot target a face-up non-Continuous, non-Equip Spell or Trap Card (ex: "Upstart Goblin"). This is because they are already “considered to be destroyed” once they are activated (even though they are not sent to the Graveyard until the chain resolves). If you target a face-down Spell or Trap Card, the opponent can activate it as a chain. If it is not Continuous, it will not be returned to the top of the Deck.

  
## PHOENIXIAN CLUSTER AMARYLLIS  
> Ⓒ This card cannot be Special Summoned except with its own effect or with "Phoenixian Seed". ① If this card attacks, it is destroyed after damage calculation. ② If this card you control is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, inflict 800 damage to your opponent. ③ During your End Phase, you can remove from play 1 Plant-Type monster from your Graveyard to Special Summon this card from your Graveyard in Defense Position.  
  

*   The Ⓒ Condition is the only way this card can be Special Summoned.
    *   You can Normal Summon “Phoenixian Cluster Amaryllis” like any other Level 8 monster.
    *   This Condition is not an effect. It cannot be negated.
*   The ① Continuous Effect applies immediately in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation.
    *   Apply this effect before any Chain is built once Damage Calculation has concluded.
    *   If “Phoenixian Cluster Amaryllis” attacks a monster with higher ATK, it is destroyed by battle and will not destroy itself with its own effect.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect activates whether this card was destroyed by battle or card effect.
*   The ③ optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   Removing a Plant from your Graveyard is a cost.

  
## PHOTON GENERATOR UNIT

*   “Photon Generator Unit” does not select a target.

  
## PHYSICAL DOUBLE

*   You cannot activate "Physical Double" during the Damage Step.
*   If you activate "Physical Double" and your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to destroy his targeted monster, the effect of "Physical Double" disappears.
*   You can target a Monster Token with "Physical Double" to create a Mirage Token copy of it.
*   When the targeted monster's Level, Attribute, etc. are changed after "Physical Double" resolves, the stats of the Mirage Token are not changed. When the targeted monster's Level, Attribute, etc., are changed before "Physical Double" resolves, the changed stats are adopted by the Mirage Token.
*   If a Field Spell Card was active before resolution of "Physical Double" that applied to the targeted monster, it applies to the original monster and to the Mirage Token. So if a Field Spell Card was increasing ATK by +500, the original would get +500 ATK and the Mirage Token would get an additional +500 ATK, for a +1000 ATK bonus total for the Mirage Token over the printed ATK of the original monster. Likewise, when "A Legendary Ocean" is active, and you activate "Physical Double" targeting a WATER monster, the Mirage Token's Level Stars are 2 fewer than the printed Level Stars of the original targeted monster.

  
## PIKERU'S CIRCLE OF ENCHANTMENT

*   This effect lasts until the end of the End Phase.

  
## PIKERU'S SECOND SIGHT

*   This card’s effect lasts until the end of your opponent’s second End Phase after this card was activated.
*   The opponent shows you all drawn cards, even if they are drawn by a card effect.

  
## PINCH HOPPER

*   Missing the Timing: Because the effect of "Pinch Hopper" effect is an optional “when… you can” Trigger Effect, "Pinch Hopper" being sent to the Graveyard has to be the very last thing that happened in order for you to activate its effect. So if you Tribute "Pinch Hopper" for a Tribute Summon, you cannot activate the effect of “Pinch Hopper” because the last thing to happen will be the Summoning of the Tribute monster. Also, if you Tribute “Pinch Hopper” for “Cannon Soldier”, the very last thing that happened will be the 500 points of damage inflicted to your opponent, so the effect of “Pinch Hopper” will not activate.
*   If you offer "Pinch Hopper" as a Tribute to attack with "Insect Queen", you can resolve "Pinch Hopper"'s effect after attack declaration.
*   When your opponent controls your "Pinch Hopper" and "Pinch Hopper" is sent to the Graveyard, "Pinch Hopper"'s effect does not activate.

  
## PINEAPPLE BLAST

*   When "Ring of Destruction" or "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Pineapple Blast", and the number of monsters on the field is changed, count the number of monsters at resolution of "Pineapple Blast"'s effect, not at activation.
*   If, when "Pineapple Blast" resolves, you have no monsters, all of your opponent's monsters are destroyed too.
*   If you Summon a monster and want to activate "Pineapple Blast", and your opponent wants to use "Trap Hole", "Pineapple Blast" is Step 1 of the chain and "Trap Hole" is Step 2.

  
## PIRANHA ARMY

*   The Battle Damage doubled by "Piranha Army"'s effect is still considered Battle Damage (not effect damage).

  
## PITCH-BLACK POWER STONE

*   You place the 3 Spell Counters on "Pitch-Black Power Stone" even if "Royal Decree" is active, so if your opponent chains "Royal Decree" to your "Pitch-Black Power Stone", or chains "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Jinzo", you still get 3 Spell Counters on it.
*   "Pitch-Black Power Stone"'s transfer effect targets.
*   "Pitch-Black Power Stone" may itself receive additional Spell Counters from effects such as "Apprentice Magician".
*   You can use a Spell Counter from a card like "Breaker the Magical Warrior" and replace "Breaker the Magical Warrior"'s Spell Counter with "Pitch-Black Power Stone" on the same turn (and use "Breaker the Magical Warrior"'s effect again that same turn, if you wish).
*   If you have multiple "Pitch-Black Power Stones", each can transfer 1 of its Spell Counters per turn.
*   If you have 1 Spell Counter left on "Pitch-Black Power Stone", and your opponent activates "Mystical Space Typhoon", and you chain the transferring effect of "Pitch-Black Power Stone" (a Spell Speed 2 effect), first the transfer effect resolves and the Spell Counter is moved, then "Pitch-Black Power Stone" is immediately destroyed before "Mystical Space Typhoon" resolves.

  
## PITCH-BLACK WARWOLF

*   The effect of this monster makes the opponent of this monster’s current controller unable to activate Trap Cards during the Battle Phase. If you take control of your opponent’s monster with "Change of Heart" during your turn, your opponent cannot activate Trap Cards during your Battle Phase, but you can.
*   The effect of this monster makes your opponent unable to activate Set Trap Cards. However, your opponent can still activate the effects of face-up Trap Cards such as "Type Zero Magic Crusher", "Ultimate Offering", "Skull Lair", "The Dragon’s Bead", and "Astral Barrier".

  
## PITCH-DARK DRAGON  
> ① Once per turn, during your Main Phase, if you control this card on the field, you can equip it to your "Dark Blade" as an Equip Card, OR unequip the Union equipment and Special Summon this card in face-up Attack Position. ② While equipped to a monster by this card's effect, increase the ATK/DEF of the equipped monster by 400 points. ③ When it attacks with an ATK that is higher than the DEF of a Defense Position monster, inflict the difference as Battle Damage to your opponent's Life Points. Ⓒ (1 monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the equipped monster is destroyed as a result of battle, destroy this card instead.)  
  
## PIXIE RING

*   Even if your monster with the lowest ATK is in Defense Position while “Pixie Ring” is active, it cannot be selected as an attack target. If all monsters you control have the same ATK while “Pixie Ring” is active, your opponent cannot declare an attack (except with monsters that can attack directly such as Earthbound Immortals, “Jinzo #7” etc.)

  
  
## PLAGUE WOLF

*   If this card's effect is activated, it's doubled ATK is not considered to be its original ATK.
*   If this card's effect is activated, and it is flipped face-down and face-up again in the same turn, its effect to destroy itself will not activate during the End Phase.

  
## PLAGUESPREADER ZOMBIE  
> ① You can return 1 card from your hand to the top of the Deck to Special Summon this card from the Graveyard. Ⓛ If you do, remove this card from play when it is removed from the field.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   Placing a card from your hand on top of the Deck is a cost.
    *   This effect does not target a card in the Graveyard. It is not negated by "Necrovalley".
*   The Ⓛ Lingering effect banishes this card when it would leave the field.  
    *   This does not start a chain.  
    *   This works like "Battle Fader"'s Condition - meaning that "Caius the Shadow Monarch" will not inflict Effect Damage if its effect banishes "Plaguespreader Zombie" summoned by the ① effect.  
    *   This effect disappears if "Plaguespreader Zombie" is flipped face-down.  
        

  
## PLANET POLLUTANT VIRUS

*   You can Tribute a face-down Alien to activate “Planet Pollutant Virus”.
*   Placing A-Counters on monsters does not start a chain.
*   If 2 copies of “Planet Pollutant Virus” are active, their effects are both applied, so each monster Summoned by your opponent gets 2 A-Counters.
*   You can activate “Planet Pollutant Virus” even if your opponent controls no monsters, or controls only monsters with A-Counters.

  
## PLANT FOOD CHAIN

*   If the equipped monster is changed to another Type, this card will be destroyed.
*   This card’s effect targets the Plant-Type monster to be Special Summoned.
*   This card’s effect to Special Summon starts a Chain.
*   If “Plant Food Chain” and the monster it is equipped to are destroyed at the same time, you can activate the effect to Special Summon a monster.
*   If “Plant Food Chain” is equipped to a monster, and is destroyed by an effect that is Chain Link 2 or higher, you can activate “Plant Food Chain’s” effect after that Chain resolves.

  
## POISON CHAIN

*   The effect of "Poison Chain" that activates in the End Phase starts a Chain.
*   If your opponent has fewer cards in their Deck than the number of "Iron Chain" monsters you control, "Poison Chain"'s effect does not activate.

  
## POISON DRAW FROG  
> ① When this face-up card on the field is sent to the Graveyard (unless it was attacked while face-down and destroyed by battle), you can draw 1 card.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
*   This effect will activate if the last thing to happen was "Poison Draw Frog":
    *   being sent from the Monster Card Zone to the Graveyard as a result of battle (while face-up Before the Damage Step);
    *   being sent from the Monster Card Zone to the Graveyard by card effect (ex: "Torrential Tribute" resolved as Chain Link 1);
    *   being sent from the Spell / Trap Card Zone to the Graveyard while being treated as a face-up Equip Spell Card by the effect of "Relinquished".
*   This effect will NOT activate if "Poison Drag Frog" was face-down when selected as an attack target.

  
## POISON FANGS

*   You cannot activate "Barrel Behind the Door" against the damage caused by "Poison Fangs", since it is a Continuous Spell Card.

  
## POLE POSITION  
> ① The face-up monster(s) with the highest ATK on the field is unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards. ② When "Pole Position" is removed from the field, destroy the face-up monster(s) with the highest ATK on the field.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect does not start a chain.
*   The ① Continuous-like Effect can become responsible for "voluntary" and "involuntary" infinite loops. Any "voluntary" action that would result in an infinite loop is simply an illegal action that players CANNOT perform. If an "involuntary" action (such as drawing a card during your Draw Phase) creates an infinite loop, the card responsible for the loop is destroyed by game mechanics.
    *   Example 1: Player A has a "[Gemini Elf](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Gemini_Elf)", a "[Luminous Spark](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Luminous_Spark)" and a "[Pole Position](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Pole_Position)" face-up on the field. Since "[Gemini Elf](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Gemini_Elf)" is the monster on the field with the highest ATK, it is unaffected by Spell Cards. If Player B Summons "[X-Head Cannon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/X-Head_Cannon)", "[Luminous Spark](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Luminous_Spark)" will raise its ATK to 2300, making it the highest ATK monster on the field and causing it to become unaffected by Spell Cards, reducing its ATK to 1800, only for "[Luminous Spark](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Luminous_Spark)"'s effect to once again increase its ATK to 2300, and so on. This voluntary action by Player B (Summoning "[X-Head Cannon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/X-Head_Cannon)") would create a "voluntary" infinite loop. Thus, Player B cannot Summon "[X-Head Cannon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/X-Head_Cannon)".
    *   Example 2: Player A has a "[Gemini Elf](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Gemini_Elf)" and an "[Opticlops](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Opticlops)" equipped with an "[Axe of Despair](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Axe_of_Despair)" face-up on the field, as well as a Set "[Ring of Destruction](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ring_of_Destruction)". Player B has a "[Blue-Eyes White Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Blue-Eyes_White_Dragon)" and a "[Pole Position](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Pole_Position)" face-up on the field. If Player A activates "[Ring of Destruction](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ring_of_Destruction)" to destroy Player B's "[Blue-Eyes White Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Blue-Eyes_White_Dragon)", then "[Opticlops](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Opticlops)" would become the monster with the highest ATK on the field, causing it to become unaffected by Spell Cards (including the equipped "[Axe of Despair](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Axe_of_Despair)") and thus it will cease to be the monster with the highest ATK on the field and the effect of "[Axe of Despair](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Axe_of_Despair)" will once again apply and raise its ATK, and so on. Therefore, Player A cannot target Player B's "[Blue-Eyes White Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Blue-Eyes_White_Dragon)" with "[Ring of Destruction](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ring_of_Destruction)" as resolving that card would create a"voluntary" infinite loop.
    *   Example 3: Player A has a face-up "[Opticlops](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Opticlops)" and a face-up "[Gemini Elf](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Gemini_Elf)". Player B has a Set "[Pole Position](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Pole_Position)" and no other cards. Player A activates "[Axe of Despair](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Axe_of_Despair)", selecting "[Opticlops](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Opticlops)" as the target. If Player B voluntarily chains "[Pole Position](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Pole_Position)", it will create a "voluntary" infinite loop upon the resolution of "[Pole Position](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Pole_Position)" and "[Axe of Despair](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Axe_of_Despair)". Therefore, Player B cannot chain "[Pole Position](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Pole_Position)", nor can they activate it while those are the only face-up monsters on the field while "[Axe of Despair](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Axe_of_Despair)" remains equipped.
    *   Example 4: Player A has a "[Pole Position](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Pole_Position)" and an "[Opticlops](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Opticlops)" face-up on the field. Player B has a "[Muka Muka](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Muka_Muka)" equipped with an "[Axe of Despair](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Axe_of_Despair)" face-up on the field with no cards in his hand. Player B draws a card at the start of his turn, making "[Muka Muka](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Muka_Muka)"'s ATK rise to 1900. Since "[Muka Muka](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Muka_Muka)" is now the monster on the field with the highest ATK, it becomes unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards. But once unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards, "[Muka Muka](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Muka_Muka)" no longer has the highest ATK on the field. An "involuntary" infinite loop has been created by an action that could not be avoided. Therefore, "[Pole Position](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Pole_Position)" is destroyed by game mechanics.
*   The ② Continuous-like Effect does NOT start a chain. The monster is destroyed simultaneously with "Pole Position" being removed from the field.

  
## POLLINOSIS

*   Tributing 1 Plant-Type monster is a cost to activate this card.
*   You can Tribute a face-down Plant-Type monster to activate this card.

  
## PORTABLE BATTERY PACK

*   If an effect is chained that removes 1 of the 2 targeted "Batteryman" monsters from the Graveyard, the remaining "Batteryman" monster is Special Summoned. When this "Batteryman" monster is removed from the field, "Portable Battery Pack" is destroyed.
*   If 1 of the 2 Special Summoned "Batteryman" monsters is flipped face-down, when the remaining "Batteryman" monster is removed from the field, "Portable Battery Pack" is destroyed. The "Batteryman" that was flipped face-down remains on the field.
*   If an effect is chained so that you have only 1 empty Monster Card Zone when “Portable Battery Pack” resolves,, choose 1 of the 2 targeted "Batteryman" monsters to be Special Summoned; the other remains in the Graveyard.

  
## POSSESSED DARK SOUL

*   If the opponent has more Level 3 or lower monsters on the field than you have empty Monster Card Zones after you Tribute this card (the Zone it occupied is now empty), you choose which ones to gain control of and the rest are destroyed. If you choose to destroy "Griggle" or "Ameba" in this manner, their effects do not activate since they never came to your side of the field.
*   You cannot gain control of face-down monsters with this card’s effect, so the opponent may chain "Book of Moon" selecting a Level 3 or lower monster and they will keep control of it.
*   You maintain control of the monsters until they are removed from the field.

  
## POT OF AVARICE  
> Select 5 Monster Cards in your Graveyard. Return those cards to the Deck, then draw 2 cards.

*   This effect targets 5 monsters in your Graveyard. This effect is negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   Synchro and Fusion Monsters targeted are returned to the Extra Deck.
    *   If a target(s) cannot be returned to the Main / Extra Deck, then no targets are returned to the Deck and you do not draw 2 cards.
*   This card CANNOT be activated while the player has 1 or 0 cards remaining in their Deck \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=850460)\].
*   VS. "Transmigration Break": This card cannot be activated. If "Transmigration Break" is chained to "Pot of Avarice", the targets are removed from play instead of being shuffled into the Main / Extra Deck(s), and since those cards were not shuffled into the Deck(s) the player does not draw 2 cards.
*   VS. “Serial Spell”: You select 5 targets for “Pot of Avarice”, and then when you chain “Serial Spell” you must select 5 targets. You can select the same monsters, but if you do this then “Serial Spell” will resolve first and shuffle some monsters back into the Deck, and then when the original “Pot of Avarice” tries to resolves, there aren’t enough monsters left so it will not resolve. Monster Cards you discard from your hand for the cost of “Serial Spell” can be targeted for the “Serial Spell” copy of “Pot of Avarice”.

  
## POT OF BENEVOLENCE

*   This card targets 2 cards from the Graveyard(s).
*   If the effect of “Pot of Benevolence” is activated by “Destiny Hero – Diamond Dude” you can still activate a “Pot of Benevolence” that same turn.
*   If “Pot of Benevolence” is negated by “Imperial Order” it is sent to the Graveyard instead of removed from play.
*   If “Mystical Space Typhoon” is Chained to “Pot of Benevolence” and destroys it, it is sent to the Graveyard instead of being removed from play.
*   You can target 1 card from each Graveyard or 2 from a single Graveyard.

  
## POT OF GENEROSITY

*   You return cards to the Deck when you resolve the effect (it’s not a cost).
*   You cannot activate “Pot of Generosity” if you have only 1 card in your hand besides “Pot of Generosity”.
*   If an effect is chained to “Pot of Generosity” so that you only have 1 or 0 cards in your hand, the effect of “Pot of Generosity” disappears. Do not return cards to the Deck and do not shuffle.
*   You can chain “Serial Spell” to “Pot of Generosity”, but you will have no hand so both effects will disappear.

  
## POWER BOND

*   The ATK bonus for “Power Bond” lasts as long as the Fusion Monster is face-up on the field. If it is flipped face-down or removed from the field, the ATK increase disappears.
*   The ATK bonus for “Power Bond” is not a fixed number. It is a bonus equal to the original ATK. So if the original ATK changes, so does the bonus from “Power Bond”.
*   You cannot use “Barrel Behind the Door” against the damage from “Power Bond” because the damage happens much later than the activation of the “Power Bond” card.
*   Even if the Fusion Monster is removed from the field or flipped face-down, you cannot negate the effect of “Power Bond” and the player will still take damage equal to the original ATK.
*   The damage you take because of “Power Bond” is equal to the original ATK of the Fusion Monster at the time the monster is Special Summoned. If the Fusion Monster has its original ATK changed, this does not affect the damage inflicted by “Power Bond”.
*   If you Fusion Summon “UFOroid Fighter” with 3000 ATK, and then later in the turn “Skill Drain” is activated, reducing its ATK to 0, you will still take 3000 points of damage during the End Phase. If you send “UFOroid Fighter” to the Graveyard so that its effect resets and its original ATK becomes zero, you still take damage equal to its original ATK at the time it was Special Summoned by “Power Bond”.
*   You can prevent the damage from “Power Bond” with “Des Wombat”.
*   If “Non-Spellcasting Area” is active and “Power Bond” is used to Special Summon a Fusion Monster that has no effect, the Fusion Monster will not gain the ATK bonus from “Power Bond”, but the controller will still take damage for “Power Bond” (because the player is not a non-Effect Monster Card).
*   If you equip the monster Special Summoned by "Power Bond" with "Megamorph", the ATK gained from "Power Bond" disappears but the damage is still inflicted in the End Phase.

  
## POWER CAPSULE

*   You select 1 “Victory Viper XX03” at activation of “Power Capsule”, but you select which of its effects to apply at resolution of “Power Capsule”.
*   If an effect is chained to destroy the selected “Victory Viper XX03”, then “Power Capsule’s” effect is not applied.
*   You can activate and resolve “Power Capsule” even if “Skill Drain” is on the field.

  
## POWER FILTER

*   Even if a monster's ATK would become more than 1000 after it is Special Summoned, you cannot Special Summon it while "Power Filter" is active.
*   Monsters with 1000 or less ATK cannot be Special Summoned face-down with "The Shallow Grave", etc.
*   Monsters with "?" ATK can be Special Summoned.

  
## POWER INJECTOR

*   Paying 600 Life Points is a cost.
*   Only Psychic-Type monsters face-up on the field when "Power Injector"'s effect resolves are affected.

  
## POWER PICKAXE

*   This effect targets the monster in your opponent’s Graveyard.
*   Removing the monster is an effect, not a cost.
*   If the target monster is not removed from play by this effect, the equipped monster does not gain ATK.
*   If the Level of the equipped monster is lower than the targeted monster when this effect resolves, the targeted monster is not removed from play.
*   Removing the target monster from play and gaining 500 ATK happen at the same time.
*   If “Power Pickaxe” is negated, the equipped monster loses the 500 ATK.
    *   It will not regain it even if “Power Pickaxe” stops being negated.
*   If “Power Pickaxe” is destroyed, the previously equipped monster loses the 500 ATK.
*   Monsters removed by this effect remain removed from play even after the End Phase.

  
## POWER SUPPLIER

*   This effect continuously targets each monster you select for as long as “Power Supplier” is face-up on the field.
*   You cannot apply “Power Supplier’s” effect on the same monster targeted during the previous turn.
*   If a monster targeted by “Power Supplier” is affected by “Shrink” or “Megamorph” you recalculate the original ATK of the monster and then reapply the +400 ATK from “Power Supplier.
*   If “Skill Drain” is activated, monsters targeted by “Power Supplier” lose the +400 ATK. If “Skill Drain” is removed from the field, the effect of “Power Supplier” is reapplied and the targeted monsters will regain the +400 ATK.
*   If your opponent gains control of one of your monsters that was targeted by “Power Supplier” it will still gain the ATK.
*   If you target a different monster each turn, all the previously targeted monsters’ ATK remain increased.

  
## POWER TOOL DRAGON  
> ① Once per turn, during your Main Phase, you can select 3 Equip Spell Cards from your Deck, have your opponent pick 1 of them at random, and add it to your hand. Return the remaining cards to your Deck. ② If this card would be destroyed while equipped with an Equip Spell Card, you can send that card to the Graveyard instead.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   You reveal the 3 Equip Spell Cards from your Deck that you pick. From that point on, you do not have to show them (so your opponent does not see them while picking randomly).
    *   You cannot activate this effect while “Thunder King Rai-Oh” is active. If you activate the effect, and an effect is chained which places “Thunder King Rai-Oh” on the field, proceed with “Power Tool Dragon’s” effect but the 1 picked card goes to the Graveyard instead of your hand.
    *   Adding a card to your hand and returning 2 cards to the Deck happen at the same time.
    *   “Drastic Drop Off” can be activated after this effect resolves.
*   The ② Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   You can send your opponent’s Equip Spell Card equipped to this card to the Graveyard.
    *   This effect applies even while "Macro Cosmos" is active. The equipped card is removed from play.
    *   If “Power Tool Dragon” and the equipped card would be destroyed at the same time (by “Judgment Dragon”), you cannot send the Equip Spell Card to the Graveyard.
    *   If “Power Tool Dragon” is equipped only with “Blast Sphere,” you cannot send “Blast Sphere” to the Graveyard to prevent “Power Tool Dragon” from being destroyed by “Blast Sphere.” If “Power Tool Dragon” is equipped with “Blast Sphere” and another Equip Spell Card, you can send the other Equip Spell Card to the Graveyard to protect “Power Tool Dragon.” In that case, “Blast Sphere” is destroyed, but no damage is inflicted for “Blast Sphere’s” effect.
    *   If you send "Double Tool C&D" to the Graveyard, the effect of “Double Tool C&D” that destroys the opponent’s monster does not activate, because it is not on the field at the end of the Damage Step.
    *   An equipped “Archfiend of Gilfer” can be sent to the Graveyard. You can activate the effect of “Archfiend of Gilfer” and re-equip it to a monster on the field (including “Power Tool Dragon”), unless it was sent to the Graveyard during the middle of a Chain, because it misses the timing.

  
## PRECIOUS CARDS FROM BEYOND

*   You can't use your "Precious Cards from Beyond" when your opponent offers 2 monsters as a Tribute, only when you do.
*   "Precious Cards from Beyond" is only for a Tribute Summon or Set, not for a Ritual Summon or Special Summon like "Lava Golem".
*   If you Tribute Summon "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" for 1 Tribute using "Cost Down", you can't activate "Precious Cards from Beyond"'s effect.
*   If you have multiple "Precious Cards from Beyond", you can activate each of their effects when you Tribute Summon or Set with 2 or more Tributes.
*   If you Tribute Summon or Set with 2 monsters, and 1 of them was your opponent's monster that you used with "Change of Heart" or "Soul Exchange", you can activate "Precious Cards from Beyond".

  
## PREMATURE BURIAL

*   You cannot activate "Tailor of the Fickle" selecting "Premature Burial" as a target.
*   You cannot activate "Fairy’s Hand Mirror" to make your opponent chose a different monster when they activate "Premature Burial".
*   If you activate this card and your opponent chains "Imperial Order" the effect of "Premature Burial" is negated and the Special Summon never occurs, but you still pay 800 Life Points. If "Imperial Order" is activated after "Premature Burial" is already on the field, the equipped monster is NOT destroyed and "Premature Burial" remains on the field meaninglessly. If "Premature Burial" is then destroyed while "Imperial Order" is still active, the monster remains on the field, but if the monster is destroyed, "Premature Burial" is also destroyed, since it is still equipped to that monster.
*   If the equipped monster is flipped face-down "Premature Burial" is destroyed but the monster is not destroyed.

  
## PREPARATION OF RITES  
> (1A) Add to your hand 1 Level 7 or lower Ritual Monster Card from your Deck. (1B) Then you can add to your hand 1 Ritual Spell Card from your Graveyard.

*   You can activate this card even if there are no Ritual Spell Cards in your Graveyard.
*   This effect resolves sequentially (do 1A, then 1B).
*   The (1A) effect to add 1 Level 7 or lower Ritual Monster Card is mandatory.
    *   If this is the last thing to happen, "[Drastic Drop Off](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Drastic_Drop_Off)" CAN be activated.
*   The (1B) effect is optional. If used, it is the last thing to happen.
    *   You do not declare your intent to use this portion of the effect.
    *   This does not target a Ritual Spell Card in the Graveyard. It is not negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   If this is the last thing to happen, "[Drastic Drop Off](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Drastic_Drop_Off)" CANNOT be activated.

  
## PREPARE TO STRIKE BACK

*   The effect of “Prepare to Strike Back” can be chained to.
*   The damage from “Prepare to Strike Back” is effect damage, not battle damage.
*   “Prepare to Strike Back” does not target.
*   If an effect is chained to “Prepare to Strike Back” that flips the monster face-down, the effect of “Prepare to Strike Back” is not applied.

  
## PREVENTION STAR

*   “Prevention Star” targets the equipped monster and the opponent’s selected monster.
*   If the opponent has no monsters to select, “Prevention Star” cannot be activated.
*   “Prevention Star” can be equipped to any monster that was changed from face-up Attack Position to face-up Defense position this turn, even if the monster is currently in Attack Position (because its battle position was changed once again).
*   If “Prevention Star” and the monster it is equipped to are both destroyed at the same time, the effect of “Prevention Star” does not activate.
*   The effect of “Prevention Star” starts a chain (when “Prevention Star” is sent to the Graveyard).
*   If you Summon “Gilford the Legend” while “Level Limit – Area B” is active, you can equip “Gilford the Legend” with “Prevention Star”, but “Prevention Star” will not target an opponent’s monster and its effect will not activate if sent to the Graveyard.
*   You can move “Prevention Star” with a card like “Tailor of the Fickle”, but the opponent’s monster that was targeted by “Prevention Star” remains targeted; you do not choose a new monster.

  
## PRICKLE FAIRY

*   If "Prickle Fairy" is changed to an Insect-Type monster with "DNA Surgery", your opponent cannot attack.

  
## PRIDEFUL ROAR

*   This card does not target.
*   You can activate this card when a Defense Position monster you control battles.
*   If your monster’s ATK is higher than the ATK of the monster it’s battling when “Prideful Roar” resolves, “Prideful Roar’s” effect disappears.

  
## PRIMAL SEED

*   "Primal Seed" can add cards to your hand that were removed from play face-up ("Dimensionhole") or face-down ("Different Dimension Capsule").
*   You target the 2 removed cards when you activate "Primal Seed".
*   If you don't have 2 or more cards removed from play, you cannot activate "Primal Seed".
*   A Fusion Monster or Synrho Monster selected with Primal Seed returns to the Extra Deck.
*   The required card only needs to be face-up on the field. It does not need to be a Monster Card, so if “Black Luster Soldier – Envoy of the Beginning” is equipped to “Relinquished”, you can activate “Primal Seed”.

  
## PRIME MATERIAL DRAGON  
> ① Any effect that would inflict damage to a player instead increases their Life Points by the same amount. ② When a card's effect to destroy a monster(s) on the field is activated, you can send 1 card from your hand to the Graveyard to negate its activation and destroy the card.

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not start a chain. This effect applies to both players.
    *   If "[The Immortal of Thunder](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/The_Immortal_of_Thunder)" is sent to the Graveyard, its owner will still lose 5000 Life Points.
    *   This effect does not stack. Two copies of "Prime Material Dragon" will NOT cause "Ookazi" to incease Life Points by 1600, it only converts the damage into Life Point gain \[[REF](http://web.archive.org/web/20080131140306/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/COMMUNITY/forums/thread/1005905.aspx)\].
    *   VS. "\[Darklord\] Nurse Reficule": if both "Nurse Reficule" and "Prime Material Dragon" are on the field when Player A's "Upstart Goblin" resolves, Player B will gain 1000 Life Points (gains / damage happen normally) \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=808154)\]. These rules apply similarly to "Bad Reaction to Simochi".
*   The ② Quick Effect can be activated the Damage Step.
    *   This effect can negate the activation of a Monster Effect (ex: "Dark Armed Dragon").
    *   This effect can negate the activation of Spell / Trap Card that would destroy a monster(s) (ex: "Smashing Ground"), and "Deck Devastation Virus" if it would destroy 1(+) monster on the field.
    *   You can negate the effect of a Spell / Trap Card that destroys a monster(s) (ex: "Blaze Accelerator", "Skull Lair"), even of a "Lightning Vortex" milled by "Destiny Hero - Diamond Dude".
    *   This effect can negate a card / effect that would destroy more than just monsters so long as at least one monster would be destroyed when it was activated (ex: "Black Rose Dragon").
*   The ② Quick Effect CANNOT be activated if the effect:
    *   would not destroy a monster right away (ex: "Magical Hats", "Limiter Removal").
    *   might not destroy a monster (ex: "Barrel Dragon", "Magical Dimension", "Acid Trap Hole").
    *   is Continuous (ex: "Kotodama") and does not start a chain.

  
## PROHIBITION  
> When you activate this card, declare 1 card name. Cards with that name and their effects cannot be used. Cards on the field before this card was activated are not affected (including face-down cards).

*   The effect declares a Card Name at activation. The declared card name cannot be changed.
    *   Cards (face-up / face-down) already on the field are unaffected.
    *   "Cyber Harpie Lady" cannot be declared, because its name is treated as "Harpie Lady". "A Legendary Ocean" cannot be declared, because its name is treated as "Umi".
    *   If "The Mask of Remnants" is declared with "Prohibition", when "Masked Beast Des Gardius" is sent to the Graveyard and its effect activates, "The Mask of Remnants" will be equipped from the Deck onto the opponent's monster.
*   The phrase "_cannot be used_" means that the declared card:
    *   can't be placed onto the field (face-up / face-down) from the hand / Extra Deck \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=612954&highlight=prohibition)\].
        *   "Metalzoa" or "Red-Eyes Black Metal Dragon" declared by "Prohibition" cannot be Special Summoned from the Deck.
        *   "Valkyrion the Magna Warrior", "The Fiend Megacyber", or "Gate Guardian" declared by "Prohibiton" cannot be Special Summoned from the hand.
        *   If a Ritual Monster is declared with "Prohibition", it cannot be Ritual Summoned.
    *   can't activate its effects in the hand (ex: "Thunder Dragon", "Honest") \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=612954&highlight=prohibition)\].
    *   can't activate its effects in the Graveyard, unless it was on the field before "Prohibition" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=612954&highlight=prohibition)\].
        *   Example 1: "Necro Gardna" is declared while it is in the Graveyard. Its effect cannot activate.
        *   Example 2: "Necro Gardna" is declared while it is on the field. Once it is sent to the Graveyard, it can activate its effect, even if "Prohibition" is still active.
        *   Example 3: If "Neko Mane King" is declared, its effect cannot activate when sent from the hand to the Graveyard by the opponent's effect, but will activate if it was on the field earlier.
    *   can't activate its effects while banished, unless it was on the field before "Prohibition" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=826293)\].
        *   Example 1: "Drill Warrior" is declared while it is removed from play by its effect. It will not Special Summon itself from the removed from play area during your next Standby Phase.
        *   Example 2: "Drill Warrior" is face-up on the field when "Prohibition" is activated. On your turn, "Drill Warrior" removes itself from play. It will Special Summon itself in your next Standby Phase, but it cannot Attack, change its battle position, activate its effects, or be used as Fusion / Synchro Material.
    *   can't be used as a Fusion / Synchro Material Monster (including "King of the Swamp") \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=612954&highlight=prohibition)\].
        *   NOTE: "Blackwing - Vayu the Emblem of Honor" does not perform a Synchro Summon, so if it was on the field when "Prohibition" was activated, it can activate its effect in the Graveyard.
*   If a declared monster is Special Summoned from the Deck / Graveyard / Banished:
    *   that monster's effects are not applied / cannot activate.
    *   that monster cannot be used as a Fusion / Synchro Material Monster.
    *   that monster cannot attack / change its battle position manually (ex: Flip Summon).
    *   that monster's maintainence costs must still be paid.
*   If "Prohibition" is negated (by "Spell Canceller"):
    *   players can "_use_" the declared card.
    *   a named monster Special Summoned face-down can be Flip Summoned.
    *   If "Prohibition" is no longer negated, any declared card(s) on the field remain unaffected.
*   VS. "Exodia the Forbidden One": when a player has all five pieces of Exodia in their hand, they win the Duel. This is a win condition and cannot be prevented with "Prohibition" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=612954&highlight=prohibition)\].
*   VS: "Parasite Paracide": After being shuffled into your opponent's Deck, if "Prohibition" is activated and declares "Parasite Paracide", when your opponent draws "Parasite Paracide" its effect is applied because its Flip Effect had already resolved \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=612954&highlight=prohibition)\].

  
## PROOF OF POWERLESSNESS  
> Activate only while you control a face-up Level 7 or higher monster. Destroy all face-up Level 5 or lower monsters your opponent controls. Monsters you control cannot attack this turn.  
  

*   Your Level 7+ monster only needs to be face-up to activate this card. The effect will resolve even if it is flipped face-down / leaves the field.
*   You can activate this card on your opponent's turn, since you will not be declaring attacks that turn.
*   Monsters like "Elemental Hero Wildheart" can still attack the turn you activate “Proof of Powerlessness.”

  
## PROTECTIVE SOUL AILIN  
> ① Once per turn, you can equip this card to an "Indomitable Fighter Lei Lei" you control, OR unequip it to Special Summon this card in face-up Attack Position. ② When equipped to a monster by this card's effect, you can change that monster's battle position once per turn. Ⓒ (A monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the equipped monster would be destroyed by battle, destroy this card instead.)  
  
## PROTECTOR OF THE SANCTUARY

*   Your opponent cannot draw with "Airknight Parshath" while you control "Protector of the Sanctuary".
*   Most cards that would cause the opponent to draw outside of the Draw Phase, such as "Card Destruction", cannot be activated, even by the controller of "Protector of the Sanctuary". However, effects that are forcibly activated, like "Morphing Jar", can be activated (but results may vary; see below).
*   If "Protector of the Sanctuary" is on the field, then Flip Effects like "Morphing Jar" will still activate because they must activate when the monster is flipped (whether it was Flip Summoned, flipped by an attack, or flipped by "Book of Taiyou", etc.).
*   If "Morphing Jar"'s effect activates, then both players discard their hands, but if you control "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent does not draw a new hand.
*   You cannot activate cards if they make your opponent draw, such as "Dragged Down Into the Grave", "Card Destruction", or "Disturbance Strategy".
*   "Protector of the Sanctuary" prevents your opponent from drawing with "Mirage of Nightmare". However, your opponent can still activate "Mirage of Nightmare", "Appropriate", etc., even though he cannot use their effects at that time.
*   If you control "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent cannot activate "Super Rejuvenation", "Jar Robber", "Monster Recovery", or "Reload" outside of the Draw Phase.
*   If you control "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent CAN activate "Reload", "Jar of Greed", "Reckless Greed", etc., during the Draw Phase (either player's).
*   If you have "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent can activate cards like "Gamble" that are random as to whether he can draw, but he cannot draw even if he wins the coin toss.
*   You can chain "Call of the Haunted" to a card effect that would make your opponent draw, and if you Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent does not draw.
*   If you have "Protector of the Sanctuary" and your "Bistro Butcher" inflicts damage to your opponent, your opponent doesn't draw.
*   You cannot activate "Heavy Slump" while you control a face-up "Protector of the Sanctuary".
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Reckless Greed" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", you cannot draw for the effect of "Reckless Greed" because of the "Protector of the Sanctuary", so you do not draw and you do not skip 2 Draw Phases.
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Disturbance Strategy" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent adds his hand to the Deck and shuffles it by the effect of "Disturbance Strategy", but "Protector of the Sanctuary" prevents him from drawing.
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Upstart Goblin" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", you cannot draw 1 card and your opponent does not gain 1000 Life Points.
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Reload" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent adds his hand to his Deck and shuffles it, but "Protector of the Sanctuary" prevents him from drawing.
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Graceful Charity" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", you cannot draw for the effect of "Graceful Charity" and you do not discard 2 cards.
*   If "Call of the Haunted" is chained to "Mind Wipe" to Special Summon "Protector of the Sanctuary", your opponent adds his hand to the Deck and shuffles, but cannot draw any cards.

  
## PROTO-CYBER DRAGON

*   If “Skill Drain” is active, this card is no longer treated as “Cyber Dragon”. You could not use it for “Attack Reflector Unit”, etc.
*   You can have 3 “Cyber Dragon” and 3 “Proto-Cyber Dragon” in your Deck and Side Deck combined.
*   If you Special Summon this card you can activate “Inferno Reckless Summon” and Special Summon “Cyber Dragon” from your Deck.
*   You can use “Machine Duplication” and a “Proto-Cyber Dragon” whose ATK has been reduced to 500 or less to Special Summon up to 2 “Cyber Dragons” from your Deck.
*   While this card is face-up on the field, it can be used as “Cyber Dragon” for a Fusion Summon.
*   If “Proto-Cyber Dragon” is used in the Fusion Summon of “Cyber Twin Dragon”, and “De-Fusion” is used on that “Cyber Twin Dragon”, you cannot Special Summon the “Proto-Cyber Dragon” from the Graveyard because its name is not 1 of the listed Fusion-Material Monsters. (It’s no longer treated as “Cyber Dragon” while in the Graveyard.)
*   If “Prohibition” is activated choosing “Cyber Dragon”, “Proto-Cyber Dragon” will not have its name treated as “Cyber Dragon” and can still attack and change its battle position.

  
## PSI-CURSE

*   “Psi-Curse” targets your opponent’s attacking monster. Destroying the monster and inflicting damage occur at the same time.

  
## PSI-IMPULSE

*   "Psi-Impulse" cannot be activated if your opponent has less than 3 cards remaining in their Deck or they have no cards in their hand.
*   If an effect is chained that results in your opponent having 0 cards in their hand, "Psi-Impule"'s effect disappears.

  
## PSI-STATION

*   "Psi-Station" targets the Normal Summoned Psychic-Type monster.
*   After resolving "Psi-Station"'s effect, if "Psi-Station" is removed from the field any monster it had affected keeps the 300 ATK increase and increased Level.

  
## PSYCHIC COMMANDER  
> ① When a Psychic-Type monster you control battles, during the Damage Step you can pay Life Points in multiples of 100 (max. 500) to have the monster it's battling lose that much ATK and DEF, until the End Phase.

*   The ① Quick Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect targets the opponent's monster.
    *   This effect can activate in any Substep of the Damage Step before Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.
    *   This effect can only be activated once during the Damage Step. (i.e., you cannot pay 500 LP twice during a single Damage Step for a total of -1000 ATK). However, you can activate it multiple times if there are multiple battles involving Psychic-Type monsters.
    *   Each copy of "Psychic Commander" can use its effect during a single Damage Step.
*   VS. [Brain Research Lab](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Card_Rulings:Brain_Research_Lab): You cannot place a Psychic Counter on "Brain Research Lab" for this effect.

  
## PSYCHIC LIFETRANCER

*   Removing 1 Psychic-Type monster in your Graveyard from play is a cost.

  
## PSYCHIC OVERLOAD

*   "Psychic Overload" targets 3 Psychic-Type monsters in your Graveyard.
*   If an effect is chained that removes 1 or more of the targeted monsters from the Graveyard, the effect of "Psychic Overload" disappears.

  
## PSYCHIC PATH

*   Paying 800 Life Points is a cost to activate “Psychic Path.” The effect targets up to 2 monsters. If 1 of the 2 targets is no longer eligible, you still add the other to your hand.

  
## PSYCHIC REJUVENATION

*   Count the number of face-up Psychic-Type monsters when "Psychic Rejuvenation" resolves.

  
## PSYCHIC SNAIL

*   "Psychic Snail"'s effect targets 1 of your other Psychic-Type monsters. Paying 800 Life Points is a cost.
*   "Psychic Snail"'s effect can be activated multiple times during the same turn, as long as you can pay the cost.

  
## PSYCHIC SOUL

*   Tributing 1 Psychic-Type monster is a cost. You can Tribute a face-down Psychic Type monster.

  
## PSYCHIC TRIGGER

*   This card targets 2 Psychic-Type monsters in your Graveyard.
*   If one or both of the targeted cards are not in your Graveyard when “Psychic Trigger” resolves, its effect disappears.

  
## PSYCHIC TUNING

*   If “Royal Decree” is activated, the monster targeted by “Psychic Tuning” will no longer be considered a Tuner. However, if “Royal Decree” is destroyed, then the monster will once again be a Tuner.
*   Calculate damage for “Psychic Tuning” based on the Level of the monster when it was Summoned (before any effects on the field are applied). (If you Special Summon a Level 5 WATER monster and “A Legendary Ocean” is active, you take 2000 damage for “Psychic Tuning”.)
*   If a monster is Special Summoned with “Psychic Tuning”, and then that monster is destroyed while “Royal Decree” is active (so “Psychic Tuning” remains on the field), then after that “Royal Decree” is destroyed and “Psychic Tuning” is destroyed, “Psychic Tuning” ‘remembers’ the Level of the Special Summoned monster, and you would still take damage based on the monster’s Level when it was Summoned.
*   If, for some reason, no monster was Special Summoned by “Psychic Tuning”, its effect to inflict damage will not activate when it is sent to the Graveyard.
*   The effect of “Psychic Tuning” that inflicts damage starts a chain.

  
## PSYCHOKINESIS

*   "Psychokinesis" targets 1 card on the field.
*   Destroying the targeted card and inflicting 1000 damage are considered to happen at the same time.
*   If an effect is chained that removes every Psychic-Type monster from your side of the field, the effect of "Psychokinesis" still resolves.
*   If an effect is chained that removes the targeted card from the field, the damage is not inflicted.

  
## PULLING THE RUG  
> Negate the activation and effect of an Effect Monster whose effect activated when a monster was Normal Summoned (even itself), and destroy that Effect Monster.

*   This effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Zaborg the Thunder Monarch").
*   If a monster effect activates in response to a Normal Summon (ex: "King Tiger Wanghu"), you can activate this card.
*   This effect does not target.
*   When a Normal Summoned monster activates its effect (ex: “Caius the Shadow Monarch”) while “Light and Darkness Dragon” is face-up, the effect of the Summoned monster will be Chain Link 1 and “Light and Darkness Dragon” will be Chain Link 2. Therefore, “Pulling the Rug” cannot activate as it cannot negate the effect of the Special Summoned monster.
*   This card cannot be activated in response to an Ignition Effect activated in the Summon response timing via Ignition Effect Priority.

  
## PUPPET KING

*   Both effects of “Puppet King” are Trigger Effects. You can Special Summon it by its effect during either player’s turn.
*   You cannot Special Summon “Puppet King” during the Damage Step with its effect. If “Puppet King” is Summoned by its own effect, and is then flipped face-down or leaves the field temporarily and returns, its effect resets.
*   It is no longer considered Special Summoned by its own effect, and will not destroy itself during the End Phase.
*   If a card like “Sangan” adds a Monster Card to your opponent’s hand, and their Deck is then shuffled, the last action that occurred was that a Monster Card was added to their hand. So you can activate “Puppet King” and Special Summon it. (The end of “Sangan”’s effect is when the monster is added to the hand.)
*   If you Special Summon “Puppet King” during your turn, it is destroyed during the End Phase of your following turn, not the turn it was Special Summoned.

  
## PUPPET MASTER  
> ① When this card is Tribute Summoned you can pay 2000 Life Points to Special Summon 2 Fiend-Type monsters from your Graveyard. They cannot attack this turn.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Paying 2000 Life Points is a cost.
    *   This effect targets 2 Fiend-Type monsters in the Graveyard at activation.
    *   If a target leaves the Graveyard, the other target is still Special Summoned.
    *   If "Skill Drain" is activated later that turn, the Summoned targets still cannot attack that turn.
*   You cannot activate this effect if you don't have 2 or more Fiend-Type monsters in your Graveyard that you can be Special Summoned.

  
## PUPPET PLANT

*   This is an Ignition Effect activated from your hand.
*   Discarding this card is a cost to activate the effect.
*   This effect targets.
*   If the targeted monster is flipped face-down by an effect chained to this card’s activation, control of the target will not switch.
*   If “DNA Surgery” is chained to this effect, so that the target’s Type changes before this effect resolves, then the effect is not applied.
*   If “DNA Surgery” is activated later in the turn, after this effect has already resolved, it has no effect on the resolution of this effect. (Control does not instantly change back. Control changes back as normal at the end of the turn.)

  
## PURSUIT CHASER

*   If "Pursuit Chaser" is in Defense Position when it is destroyed by battle, its effect does not activate.

  
## PYRAMID ENERGY

*   You can activate "Pyramid Energy" during the Damage Step.
*   The effect of "Pyramid Energy" is not applied to monsters summoned after "Pyramid Energy"’s resolution.

  
## PYRAMID TURTLE

*   You may Special Summon a high-level monster with "Pyramid Turtle"'s effect (like "Vampire Lord" or "Ryu Kokki"), but not a Special-Summon only monster (like "Spirit of the Pharaoh").

  
## PYRO CLOCK OF DESTINY

*   You can use "Pyro Clock of Destiny" to advance the turn count by 1 for these cards: “Deck Devastation Virus”, "Swords of Revealing Light", "Lightforce Sword", or "Final Countdown".

  
## QUEEN OF THORNS  
> ① Each player must pay 1000 Life Points to Normal or Special Summon a non-Plant-Type monster from their hand.

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   If you Tribute a face-up “Queen of Thorns” for a Tribute / Special Summon, pay 1000 Life Points.
    *   Apply this effect when a player would to perform a Normal / Special Summon from the hand.
    *   Pay 1000 Life Points as a cost when performing a Normal / Special Summon (ex: "Lava Golem").
    *   Pay 1000 Life Points when resolving an effect performing a Normal / Special Summon.
        *   Example: "Celestial Transformation" is activated by a player with <1000 Life Points and an effect Special Summons "Queen of Thorns". "Celestial Transformation" resolves without effect because the player does not have enough Life Points to pay for the Special Summon.
*   If there are 2 face-up "Queen of Thorns", players must pay 2000 Life Points.

  
## QUESTION

*   Remember that you cannot shuffle your Graveyard or change the order of cards in your Graveyard at any time.
*   If a monster is named with "Question" that could not be Special Summoned, "Question"’s effect disappears and the monster is neither Special Summoned nor removed from play. So the effect of "Question" disappears if the bottom monster is incorrectly named and is "Helpoemer", "Dark Ruler Ha Des", etc.
*   If you would Special Summon "Tyrant Dragon" from the Graveyard using "Question", you must Tribute 1 Dragon and if you cannot you cannot Special Summon "Tyrant Dragon" and the effect of "Question" disappears.

  
## QUICK CHARGER

*   If an effect is chained that removes 1 of the 2 targeted "Batteryman" monsters from your Graveyard, the remaining "Batteryman" monster is added to your hand.

  
## QUICKDRAW SYNCHRON  
> ① You can send 1 monster from your hand to the Graveyard and Special Summon this card from your hand. Ⓒ You can substitute this card for any 1 “Synchron” Tuner monster for a Synchro Summon. Ⓒ This card cannot be used as a Synchro Material Monster, except for the Synchro Summon of a monster that lists a “Synchron” monster as a Tuner monster.

*   The ① Special Summon starts a chain (treat it as an Ignition Effect) \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/119293-hardened-armed-dragon/)\].
    *   Sending (not discarding) 1 monster from your hand to the Graveyard is not a cost.
    *   Sending 1 monster from your hand to the Graveyard and the Special Summon occur simultaneously.
    *   This effect can activate while "Macro Cosmos" applies, remove from play the sent monster \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=837311)\].
    *   If this effect (or its activation) is negated (by "Royal Oppression" / "Gladiator Beast War Chariot"), do not send 1 monster from your hand to the Graveyard \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=797763&page=2)\].
    *   If an effect (ex: "Rivalry of Warlords", "Gozen Match", "Summon Limit") is chained such that "Quickdraw Synchron" cannot be summoned, NO monster is sent from your hand to the Graveyard.
        *   The key conjunction employed here is "_and_" and how "_do A and B_" is ruled by P.S.C.T. today.
        *   See "[Acorno](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Acorno)" for a comparable effect written with P.S.C.T.
*   This card's Ⓒ Conditions are not Effects. They cannot be negated.

  
## QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG

*   "Quillbolt Hedgehog"'s Special Summon effect is an Ignition Effect.
*   If an effect is chained that removes your only Tuner monster from your side of the field, "Quillbolt Hedgehog" is not Special Summoned.
*   If "Quillbolt Hedgehog" is flipped face-down after it is Special Summoned by its effect, it is not removed from play when it is removed from the field, even if it is flipped face-up.
*   If "Quillbolt Hedgehog" is Special Summoned by its effect and is later removed from the field while "Skill Drain" is active, "Quillbolt Hedgehog" is still removed from play.
*   If you Special Summon "Quillbolt Hedgehog" with its effect and afterwards remove it from play with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter", "Quillbolt Hedgehog" is not returned to the field in the End Phase.

  
## R - RIGHTEOUS JUSTICE

*   Count the number of “Elemental Heroes” on your side of the field when the effect of “R – Righteous Justice” resolves.
*   There must be enough Spell & Trap Cards on the field in order to activate “R – Righteous Justice”. If there are fewer Spell & Trap Cards than the number of your “Elemental Heroes” then you cannot activate it.
*   If an effect is chained that reduces the number of Spell & Trap Cards on the field so that you have more “Elemental Heroes” than cards to destroy, the entire effect disappears.
*   You cannot pick “R – Righteous Justice” as 1 of the Spell & Trap Cards to destroy for its own effect.
*   “R – Righteous Justice” does not target.

  
## RADIANT MIRROR FORCE

*   If the number of face-up Attack Position monsters becomes 2 or less due to an effect chained to this card, all face-up Attack Position monsters your opponent controls are still destroyed when this card resolves.

  
## RADIANT SPIRIT

*   This card’s effect will destroy “Elemental Mistress Doriado”.

  
## RAGING CLOUDIAN

*   The "Cloudian" monster Special Summoned with "Raging Cloudian" cannot be targeted by "Book of Moon".

  
## RAGING EARTH

*   This card’s effect will destroy “Elemental Mistress Doriado”.

  
## RAGING ERIA

*   This card’s effect is an Ignition Effect.
*   Tributing a monster is a cost. You cannot Tribute a monster if you do not have a monster with the appropriate Attribute in your hand to Special Summon.
*   If this card is flipped face-down, any monsters Special Summoned by her effect will not be destroyed. If this card is destroyed while she is face-down, any monsters Special Summoned by her effect will not be destroyed.
*   If a monster Special Summoned by this card’s effect is flipped face-down, it will not be destroyed when this card is destroyed.

  
## RAGING FLAME SPRITE

*   The +1000 ATK lasts as long as "Raging Flame Sprite" remains face-up on the field. "Raging Flame Sprite" can continue to get +1000 ATK each time it successfully attacks directly (becoming ATK 1100, then ATK 2100, etc.).
*   The effect of "Raging Flame Sprite" is a Continuous Effect that cannot be chained to.
*   The effect of "Raging Flame Sprite" is resolved after damage calculation and before Flip Effects are resolved (so the timing is the same as "Don Zaloog" and "Airknight Parshath").
*   If "Raging Flame Sprite" is equipped with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light – Tryce", its ATK will increase by 1000 points after each successful attack ("Raging Flame Sprite" must still deal at least 1 point of damage with each attack for its effect to apply). So the second attack will be with +1000 ATK, and it will gain another +1000 ATK after the completion of the second attack.

  
## RAGING MAD PLANTS

*   You must have at least 1 Plant-Type monster in your Graveyard in order to activate this card. The ATK increase is locked-in when this card resolves. The ATK increase will not change if the number of Plant-Type monsters in your Graveyard changes after this card resolves. The ATK increase will not apply to Plant-Type monsters Summoned after this card resolves. The effect to destroy all face-up Plant-Type monsters you control will apply to monsters Summoned after this card resolves. You can activate “Raging Mad Plants” during the Damage Step. The effect to destroy all face-up Plant-Type monsters you control does not start a Chain.

  
## RAIGEKI

*   If there are no monsters on your opponent’s side of the field you may not activate "Raigeki".

  
## RAI-JIN

*   If "Rai-Jin" is face-up on your side of the field and you don't have any LIGHT Monsters in your Graveyard, "Rai-Jin"'s ATK is 0.

  
## RAIN STORM

*   The effect of “Rain Storm” targets the selected face-up “Cloudian” monster.
*   You select which of “Rain Storm’s” effects to apply when resolving “Rain Storm”.
*   The ATK of the selected “Cloudian” monster remains decreased as long the “Cloudian” monster remains face-up on the field.

  
## RAINBOW DARK DRAGON

*   "Rainbow Dark Dragon"'s effect to increase its ATK is an Ignition Effect.
*   Removing from play all other DARK monsters you control and in your Graveyard is a cost.

  
## RAINBOW DRAGON

*   This card's effect to increase its ATK can be activated during the Damage Step. The ATK increase is applied as long as "Rainbow Dragon" remains face-up on the field.
*   Sending the "Crystal Beast" monsters you control to the Graveyard is a cost for "Rainbow Dragon"'s first effect.

  
## RAINBOW GRAVITY

*   A "Rainbow Dragon" or "Rainbow Dark Dragon" in the Graveyard that was not first properly Special Summoned cannot be Special Summoned with "Rainbow Gravity".
*   If an effect is chained that reduces the number of "Crystal Beast" monsters with different names to 6 or less, "Rainbow Gravity"'s effect still resolves.

  
## RAINBOW LIFE

*   Discarding 1 card is a cost to activate "Rainbow LIfe".
*   "Rainbow Life"'s effect is applied to Battle Damage and damage from effects.
*   After activating "Rainbow Life", if you activate an effect that inflicts damage to both your and your opponent's Life Points, your opponent will receive damage and you will gain Life Points.
*   After activating "Rainbow Life", you cannot chain "Barrel Behind the Door" to an effect that would inflict damage to your Life Points because you will gain Life Points instead.
*   If you activate "Rainbow Life" and your opponent has "Bad Reaction to Simochi" active, whenever you would gain Life Points with "Rainbow Life" you will receive damage instead.

  
## RAINBOW NEOS

*   All three of "Rainbow Neos'" effects are Ignition Effects.

  
## RAINBOW PATH

*   "Rainbow Path" targets the attacking monster. Sending a "Crystal Beast" card from your Spell and Trap Card Zone to your Graveyard is a cost.
*   Any "Crystal Beast" card in your Spell and Trap Card Zone can be used to pay the cost. If the "Crystal Beast" card is being treated as an Equip Card, it can be used to pay the cost.
*   You do not have to add a "Rainbow Dragon" or "Dark Rainbow Dragon" to your hand.
*   If "Rainbow Path" fails to negate the monster's attack, you cannot add "Rainbow Dragon" or "Dark Rainbow Dragon" to your hand.

  
## RAINBOW VEIL

*   "Rainbow Veil"'s effect starts being applied when the attack is declared. It does not start a Chain. It does not target the opponent's monster.
*   Effects that activate in the Graveyard or removed zone will not be negated by "Rainbow Veil".
*   If a monster affected by "Rainbow Veil" is not destroyed by the battle, its effects remain negated for the remainder of the Battle Phase.
*   When "Rainbow Veil" is removed from the field or negated, the effects of the monster you battled with are no longer negated.
*   If a monster equipped with "Rainbow Veil" attacks a face-down monster, when that monster is flipped face-up in the Damage Step its effects are negated.
*   If a monster affected by "Rainbow Veil" is flipped face-down after the battle, its effects are no longer negated.
*   While "Rainbow Veil" is equipped to a monster that is unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards, "Rainbow Veil"'s effect is still applied.

  
## RAIZA THE STORM MONARCH  
> ① When this card is Tribute Summoned, return 1 card on the field to the top of its owner's Deck.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Trap Hole").
    *   This effect targets 1 (face-up / face-down) card anywhere on the field.
    *   If the target is a Spell / Trap Card and it is chained, it is sent to the Graveyard when the chain resolves. Only a chained Continuous Trap Card will be returned to the top of the owner's Deck.
*   "[Monarch](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Monarch)"'s Trigger Effects are Spell Speed 1 and activate at the time they are successfully Tribute Summoned. If the opponent wants to activate a card like "[Bottomless Trap Hole](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Bottomless_Trap_Hole)", it will be placed onto the chain after the "[Monarch](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Monarch)"'s effect. But "[Monarchs](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Monarch)" don't need to remain on the field to resolve their effects, so destroying them with "[Bottomless Trap Hole](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Bottomless_Trap_Hole)" will not negate their effect

  
## RALLIS THE STAR BIRD

*   “Rallis the Star Bird’s” effect that increases its ATK during the Damage Step is a Continuous Effect. It cannot be chained to. As soon as you enter the Damage Step the ATK is increased.
*   “Rallis the Star Bird’s” effect that removes it from play is a Trigger Effect and can be chained to. Returning it to play cannot be chained to.
*   If there is no vacant Monster Card Zone when “Rallis the Star Bird” would return to play it is destroyed.
*   If your opponent takes control of “Rallis the Star Bird” and it is removed from play by its own effect it will return to play on their side of the field at the start of their next turn’s Battle Phase, but then it will immediately move back to your side of the field.

  
## RAMPAGING RHYNOS

*   “Rampaging Rhynos” cannot move into a Monster Card Zone targeted by “Ground Collapse”.
*   If you activate the effect of a face-up “Rampaging Rhynos”, and “Book of Moon” is chained to this effect, the face-down “Rampaging Rhynos” will still move.

  
## RAPID-FIRE MAGICIAN

*   This card’s effect is a Continuous Effect that cannot be chained to.
*   The 400 points of damage is inflicted after the effect of the Normal Spell Card is resolved. So if the opponent had 300 Life Points, and you activated “Rain of Mercy” while you had “Rapid-Fire Magician” face-up on the field, the opponent would gain 1000 Life Points, and then take the 400 points of damage, leaving them at 900 Life Points.

  
## RAPTOR WING STRIKE

*   Sending 1 “Blacking” monster to the Deck is a cost.
*   You cannot activate “Raptor Wing Strike” if you have no “Blackwing” monsters in your Deck.
*   If you use a “Blackwing” Synchro Monster to pay the cost of “Raptor Wing Strike”, that Synchro Monster is returned to the Extra Deck.

  
## RARE METALMORPH  
> ① Select 1 face-up Machine-Type monster. It gains 500 ATK. One time only, negate the effect of a Spell Card that targets that monster. ② When the selected monster is removed from the field, destroy this card.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies on the field.
    *   This effect (continuously) targets a face-up Machine-Type monster anywhere on the field.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down / leaves the field, this card remains face-up meaninglessly.
    *   If the Machine-Type monster is targeted by either player's Spell Card, that effect is negated when it resolves. A Continuous-like / Lingering Effect that targets a Machine-Type is permanently negated.
    *   If you chain "Rare Metalmorph" to "Ekibyo Drakmord" that targets a Machine-Type monster, "Ekibyo Drakmord" is equipped but its effect is negated while "Rare Metalmorph" is active.
    *   You can activate this card during the Damage Step.
*   The ② Continuous-like Effect applies on the field. This does not start a Chain.
    *   This effect applies if the target is destroyed / removed from play / returned to the hand or Deck.
    *   This effect can be negated by "Royal Decree".

  
## RARE VALUE

*   If there are no “Crystal Beast” cards in Spell & Trap Card Zone when this card resolves, you cannot draw 2 cards.
*   If there is only 1 “Crystal Beast” card in your Spell & Trap Card Zone when this card resolves, that card is sent to the Graveyard and you draw 2 cards.
*   If "Macro Cosmos" or "Banisher of the Raidance" is on the field, you can still activate "Rare Value", but since the "Crystal Beast" card is not sent to the Graveyard you do NOT draw 2 cards.

  
## RAREGOLD ARMOR

*   "Raregold Armor" & "Metalsilver Armor" only apply their effects when the same player controls the Equip Spell Card and the monster it is equipped to; you can equip these cards to a monster controlled by your opponent but the effect is not active.
*   If you have 2 monsters equipped with "Raregold Armor", then your opponent cannot attack.
*   If you have a Warrior-Type monster equipped with "Raregold Armor", and "Marauding Captain", your opponent cannot attack.
*   You have an Amazoness equipped with "Raregold Armor", and "Amazoness Tiger", your opponent cannot attack.
*   "Ring of Magnetism" 'trumps' "Raregold Armor", "Amazoness Tiger", and "Marauding Captain". So if you have a monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", and a monster equipped with "Raregold Armor", the monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" is the target of attacks.
*   If you control "Patrician of Darkness" and have a monster equipped with "Raregold Armor", you can only re-direct attacks to the monster equipped with "Raregold Armor" as it is the only legal target.

  
## RAVIEL, LORD OF PHANTASMS

*   You can Tribute face-down Fiends to Special Summon “Raviel, Lord of Phantasms”.
*   Tributing 1 monster is a cost to activate this card’s Ignition Effect. You cannot Tribute this card for its own effect.
*   Summoning a “Phantasm Token” is a Trigger Effect that activates when the opponent Normal Summons a monster. The activation of this effect can be chained to.
*   If “Skill Drain” is activated, any “Phantasm Tokens” on the field still cannot attack. (Also, while “Skill Drain” is active, “Raviel, Lord of Phantasms” will not generate any more “Phantasm Tokens”.)
*   A “Phantasm Token” cannot be forced to attack with a card effect like “Dark Spirit of the Silent” or “Amazoness Archers”.
*   If your opponent Normal Summons a monster in a chain using “Ultimate Offering”, resolve all effects in that chain, then activate the effect of “Raviel, Lord of Phantasms” to start a new chain. If the Normal Summon for “Ultimate Offering” was Chain Link 2 or higher, you still activate the effect of “Raviel”. It does not miss the timing.
*   If all of your Monster Card Zones are full, this card’s effect will activate, but if there are no available spaces when the effect resolves, the effect is not applied.
*   If an effect is chained to turn “Raviel, Lord of Phantasms” face-down, or remove it from the field, the “Phantasm Token” will still be Special Summoned when the effect resolves.

  
## RAY OF HOPE

*   You can't activate "Ray of Hope" if you don't have 2 LIGHT monsters in your Graveyard.

  
## READY FOR INTERCEPTING

*   If you activate "Ready for Intercepting" after your opponent’s attack declaration to flip face-down the monster which is being attacked, a replay does not occur. Complete the attack as normal. (This must happen during the Battle Step, not the Damage Step.)
*   If you activate "Ready for Intercepting" and target the attacking monster, it is flipped into face-down Defense Position and the attack ends. (This must happen during the Battle Step, not the Damage Step.)
*   While the effect of "Light of Intervention" is active, you cannot activate "Ready for Intercepting".
*   If you chain "Ready for Intercepting" to "Hammer Shot" to flip a monster face-down, that monster will not be included in determining which monster is destroyed by the effect of "Hammer Shot".

  
## REALM OF LIGHT

*   Adding or removing Shine Counters does not start a Chain.
*   You cannot remove Shine Counters when your opponent activates a Field Spell Card, because "Realm of Light" is not being destroyed by a card effect.

  
## REAPER OF THE CARDS

*   This card can destroy a Trap Card on either side of the field. So if your opponent has no Trap Cards and no Set Spell or Trap Cards, you must destroy a card on your side of the field. If it is face-down Spell Card you must reveal it to your opponent, and it is not destroyed.

  
## REASONING

*   Pick up cards until you pick up a monster that can be Normal Summoned.
*   You can Special Summon a high-level monster like "Dark Magician" with "Reasoning", but not Special Summon-only monsters like "Gate Guardian", Ritual Monsters, etc.
*   If you pick up a Spirit Monster, then all picked up cards are sent to the Graveyard.
*   If no monster is picked up, shuffle your Deck and put it back in the Deck Zone; the effect of "Reasoning" disappears.
*   You cannot activate "Reasoning" if you already activated "Scapegoat" this turn.
*   If "Banisher of the Light" is Special Summoned with "Reasoning", the other cards picked up for "Reasoning" are sent to the Graveyard. The effect of "Banisher of the Light" is not applied until after "Reasoning" resolves.

  
## REBORN ZOMBIE

*   This card’s effect is a Continuous Effect.
*   For “Reborn Zombie”’s effect, you look at the number of cards in your hand at Damage Calculation. So if you have no cards in your hand and the opponent attacks your Attack Position “Reborn Zombie” with “The Bistro Butcher”, your monster will not be destroyed. Then you will draw the 2 cards when the effect of “The Bistro Butcher” resolves.

  
## RECKLESS GREED

*   If "Reckless Greed" is activated, causing you to skip your next 2 Draw phases, and you also must skip your Draw Phase due to another effect such as "Offerings to the Doomed", the skipped Phases do not accumulate. So if you activate "Reckless Greed" and "Offerings to the Doomed", you only skip 2 Draw Phases.
*   Skipping a Draw Phase is an effect, not a cost, so if "Reckless Greed" is negated you do not skip your Draw Phases.

  
## RECKONED POWER

*   Revealing “Iron Core of Koa’ki Meiru” is a cost to activate this card.

  
## RECURRING NIGHTMARE

## RED-EYES WYVERN

    *   Even if this was because you could not (by "[Lava Golem](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Lava_Golem)" / "[Hidden Armory](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Hidden_Armory)").
*   You CANNOT activate this effect if:
    *   "[Red-Eyes Wyvern](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Red-Eyes_Wyvern)" was only discarded to the Graveyard during the End-of-Turn Discard because you had more cards than your hand size limit (see Edison Format Rule #10 [HERE](https://www.edisonformat.com/format-rules.html)).
    *   You Set / Normal Summoned (even if it was negated by "[Solemn Judgment](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Solemn_Judgment)") a monster this turn.

  
## RED-EYES ZOMBIE DRAGON

*   "Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon"'s first effect is a Continuous Effect. Its second effect is an optional Trigger Effect.
*   The monster destroyed in battle by "Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon" must be a Zombie-Type monster both on the field and in the Graveyard. If "DNA Surgery" is active, with "Zombie-Type" chosen, and a Non-Zombie-Type monster is destroyed in battle by "Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon", "Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon"'s effect does not activate because the monster reverts to a Non-Zombie-Type monster in the Graveyard.
*   When your "Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon" attacks and destroys your opponent's "Pyramid Turtle" in battle, if both effects are activated, "Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon"'s effect is Chain Link 1 and "Pyramid Turtle"'s effect is Chain Link 2.

  
## REFLECT BOUNDER

*   "Reflect Bounder" inflicts its effect damage, then damage calculation is applied normally, then "Reflect Bounder" is destroyed by its own effect.
*   When an Attack Position "Reflect Bounder" is attacked, it is destroyed by its own effect even if the ATK of "Reflect Bounder" is lower than the ATK of the attacking monster.
*   The damage inflicted by "Reflect Bounder"'s effect is not Battle Damage, so it cannot be reduced to 0 with "Waboku".
*   Effects such as "Metalmorph" and "Injection Fairy Lily" happen after "Reflect Bounder"'s effect, because "Reflect Bounder"'s effect happens before damage calculation.
*   When your opponent attacks your Attack Position "Reflect Bounder", your opponent can use "Barrel Behind the Door" against "Reflect Bounder"'s effect.
*   When your opponent's "White Magical Hat" with "Axe of Despair" attacks your "Reflect Bounder", "Reflect Bounder" inflicts its effect damage, damage calculation is performed, and "White Magical Hat"'s effect is activated.
*   When "Reflect Bounder" is attacked by "Dark Ruler Ha Des", "Reflect Bounder" inflicts its effect damage, damage calculation is applied, "Reflect Bounder" is determined to be destroyed as a result of battle, "Dark Ruler Ha Des" negates "Reflect Bounder"'s effect, and "Reflect Bounder" does not destroy itself with its own effect, however it was still destroyed as a result of battle.
*   "Reflect Bounder"'s effect does not target.
*   If "Reflect Bounder" is attacked by "D. D. Warrior Lady", and the effect of "Reflect Bounder" is activated, "Reflect Bounder" inflicts damage, damage calculation is performed, and "Reflect Bounder" destroys itself with its own effect and is sent to the Graveyard, so even if "D. D. Warrior Lady" activates her effect, "Reflect Bounder" is not removed from play because it is already in the Graveyard.

*   The ② Continuous Effect does not activate.
    *   This effect only applies while a monster is equipped by the ① effect.

    *   prevent activation of cards / effects that change control of a monster (ex: "Creature Swap").
        *   Control is changed but then control goes back to the original owners. This means that if you give control of "Griggle" or "Ameba" to your opponent, their effect IS activated even though "Griggle"/"Ameba" then returns to the original owner's control afterwards.
    *   cause control to revert if "Remove Brainwashing" is destroyed. (ex: "Remove Brainwashing" is destroyed after "Mind Control" has resolved. Control does NOT revert control of the monster to the player who activated "Mind Control").
*   VS. "[Black Garden](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Black_Garden)": Player A Normal Summoned a monster, causing a "Rose Token" to be Special Summoned to Player B's field. Player A is the owner of that "Rose Token". "Remove Brainwashing" will cause Player A to gain control of that "Rose Token".
*   VS. "[Vengeful Servant](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Vengeful_Servant)": if the equipped monster changes control, it will immediately switch back before the effect of "Vengeful Servant" can activate. Afterwards, "Vengeful Servant" will activate once, and inflict damage to the equipped monster's current controller: its original owner.
*   When your opponent activates "Autonomous Action Unit" and Special Summons your Synchro Monster to his field, if "Remove Brainwashing" is on the field, then the monster is still considered to have been Special Summoned to your opponent's field, even though it is now on your side of the field. Thus, you can activate the effect of "Shiny Black "C" to destroy the Synchro Monster, even though it is on your side of the field.

*   If one or more of the targeted cards are removed from the Graveyard by an effect Chained to this card, the remaining targets will still be returned to the Deck(s).
*   A monster destroyed in the hand or Deck can be chosen as a target for this card.

  
## RETURN ZOMBIE

*   The effect of “Return Zombie” is an Ignition Effect. Paying 500 Life Points is a cost to activate the effect of “Return Zombie”.
*   “Return Zombie’s” effect begins a Chain. It is possible to activate “Disappear” in chain to remove “Return Zombie” from play.
*   If you use the effect of “Return Zombie” during your Standby Phase, and then during that same Standby Phase it is sent to your Graveyard, you can activate “Return Zombie’s” effect to return it to your hand again during the same Standby Phase. “Return Zombie’s” effect can be used multiple times during the same Standby Phase.

  
## REVERSAL OF FATE

*   The effect of the "Arcana Force" monster remains changed as long as it remains face-up on the field.

  
## REVERSAL QUIZ

*   Sending all cards in the hand and on the field to the Graveyard is a cost. If there are no cards in your hand or on the field you cannot activate this card. You must have a card either in your hand or on the field to activate this card.

  
## REVERSE TRAP

*   If a card gives a monster +100 ATK, and "Reverse Trap" is activated, that monster now has -100 ATK instead. This card only affects increases and decreases of a defined value, such as +200 (which becomes -200) or -500 (which becomes +500). It does not change cards which "double", "half", or "reduce to 0" the ATK or DEF of a monster.
*   You cannot activate this card during the Damage Step. This card affects monsters, Spell Cards, and Trap Cards controlled by both players.
*   Additional "Reverse Traps" activated in the same turn will have no effect. So "Reverse Trap" will change "Axe of Despair’"s effect of adding 1000 ATK to subtracting 1000 ATK. If a second "Reverse Trap" is activated, the equipped monster still has -1000 ATK.

  
## REVIVAL GIFT

*   This card targets 1 Tuner monster in your Graveyard.
*   “Revival Gift” only negates the Tuner monster’s effects that activate on the field. If you Special Summon “Sinister Sprocket” and use it as a Synchro Material Monster, its effect will activate in the Graveyard.
*   The Tuner monster and 2 “Gift Fiend Tokens” are considered to be Special Summoned at the same time.
*   You cannot activate this card if your opponent has 1 or fewer empty Monster Card Zones.
*   If the targeted Tuner monster is no longer in your Graveyard when “Revival Gift” resolves, you still Special Summon 2 “Gift Fiend Tokens” to your opponent’s side of the field.

  
## REVIVAL JAM

*   If you activate "Change of Heart" to take control of "Revival Jam", and it is sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle, the owner (not you) gets the option to pay 1000 Life Points to Special Summon "Revival Jam" to their side of the field.
*   The cost of 1000 Life Points is paid when "Revival Jam" is sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle. If "Revival Jam" is removed from the Graveyard before your next Standby Phase by cards like "Disappear" you do not get your Life Points returned to you.
*   If you pay 1000 Life Points when your "Revival Jam" is sent to the Graveyard, and then activate "Call of the Haunted" to return it to the field before your next Standby Phase, and it is again destroyed you must pay another 1000 Life Points if you want it to return during your next Standby Phase. Its condition was reset when it was taken out of the Graveyard by the effect of "Call of the Haunted".

  
## REVIVED KING HA DES  
> ① Negate the effects of Effect Monsters destroyed by battle with Zombie-Type monsters you control.

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate. It also applies to "Revived King Ha Des".
    *   This effect CANNOT be negated by "Divine Wrath", but CAN be negated by "Skill Drain".
    *   This effect does not apply if "DNA Surgery" changes to your Zombie-Types into non-Zombie-Types.
*   Monster destroyed by battle are marked for destruction at the end of Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.
    *   Effects that activate in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation are negated.
    *   Effects that activate in Substep 6 - Resolve Effects are negated (ex: "Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter" and "D.D. Warrior Lady").
    *   Effects that activate in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step are negated (ex: "Mystic Tomato", "Zoma the Spirit").
    *   Effects that activate in the Graveyard are negated; such as "Treeborn Frog", "Plaguespreader Zombie", "Sinister Serpent". The negation is reset if these cards are removed from the Graveyard.
    *   This effect does not affect monsters destroyed as substitutes such as "Six Samurai" monsters, or if "Relinquished" would be destroyed by battle while equipped with "Sangan".
*   If your "Revived King Ha Des" or other Zombie-Type monster destroys "Tyrant Dragon" as a result of battle, a Dragon-Type monster must still be Tributed when "Tyrant Dragon" is Special Summoned from the Graveyard. This is because Tributing a Dragon-Type monster is a condition on the Summoning of the card; it is not part of the effect. For the same reason, if a Spirit Monster is destroyed by a Zombie-Type monster when "Revived King Ha Des" is on the field, it still cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard.

  
## REVOKE FUSION

*   Fusion Monsters that are not Fusion Summoned with "Polymerization" ("XYZ-Dragon Cannon", etc.) can be selected with "Revoke Fusion" and you can Special Summon 1 of the Fusion Material Monsters listed on the Fusion Monster.
*   You cannot Special Summon a Fusion Material Monster that is not specified by name. Example: You cannot select "Chimeratech Overdragon" with "Revoke Fusion" and Special Summon a "Blowback Dragon", but you can Special Summon a "Cyber Dragon".
*   Fusion Monsters that do not specify any Fusion Material Monsters by name ("Five-Headed Dragon", etc.) cannot be selected with "Revoke Fusion".
*   You cannot select a Fusion Monster that does not list any Fusion Material Monsters you can Special Summon. Example: You cannot select "Dragon Master Knight" because you cannot Special Summon "Black Luster Soldier" or "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" from your hand.
*   You cannot activate "Revoke Fusion" if there are no monsters in your hand that you can Special Summon

  
## RIBBON OF REBIRTH

*   If you equip your opponent's monster with "Ribbon of Rebirth" and destroy the monster in battle, you will Special Summon it onto your side of the field during the End Phase.
*   If "Ribbon of Rebirth" is not in the Graveyard or Removed Zone during the End Phase, its effect does not activate.
*   "Ribbon of Rebirth" does not target the monster it will Special Summon.
*   If the monster that was equipped with "Ribbon of Rebirth" is removed from play, it will not be Special Summoned. Even if the monster is returned to the Graveyard during the same turn, it will not be Special Summoned.
*   If you do not have any open Monster Card Zones during the End Phase, the effect of your "Ribbon of Rebirth" still activates but its effect disappears when it resolves.

  
## RING OF DESTRUCTION

*   You cannot activate "Ring of Destruction" during the Damage Step.
*   "Ring of Destruction" inflicts damage based on the current (total) ATK value, NOT the original ATK.
*   This card targets a monster.
*   If you chain "Ring of Destruction" to "Magic Cylinder", "Magic Cylinder"’s effect disappears because the monster is no longer there (so "Magic Cylinder" inflicts no damage).
*   If a player Tributes "Witch of the Black Forest" for "Summoned Skull", you can chain "Ring of Destruction" to the effect of "Witch of the Black Forest", in order to destroy "Summoned Skull". If this reduces the player’s Life Points to zero, then they cannot use "Witch of the Black Forest"’s effect (to retrieve a 5th Exodia piece, for example).

  
## RING OF MAGNETISM

*   If there is a monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" on the opponent’s side of the field, if your monsters are going to attack they must attack the equipped monster. Even Toon Monsters, "Inaba White Rabbit", and monsters like "Jinzo #7" and "Queen’s Double" that can normally Attack Directly must attack the equipped monster.
*   If you have two or more monsters on your side of the field equipped with your "Ring of Magnetism" cards, you choose which monster will be attacked.

  
## RIRYOKU

*   This card halves the current ATK of the monster it targets.
*   If this card targets a monster that is affected by "Shrink", its ATK will become half of the halved ATK, or 1/4 its original ATK. If a monster whose ATK is halved by "Riryoku" is affected by "Shrink", its ATK will become half of its original (printed) ATK.

  
## RIRYOKU FIELD

*   This card cannot be used against "Monster Reborn" or "Premature Burial" since they do not target a monster on the field.
*   This card cannot be used against "Fissure", "Smashing Ground", or "Dark Hole" because these cards do not target.

  
## RISE OF THE SNAKE DEITY

*   You cannot activate this card if you do not have “Vennominaga the Deity of Poisonous Snakes” in your hand or Deck.
*   You can activate multiple copies of this card in the same Chain when “Vennominon the King of Poisonous Snakes” is destroyed.
*   You can activate this card when your "Vennominon the King of Poisonous Snakes" that is being treated as a Spell Card (by "Relinquished", etc.) is destroyed.

  
## RITUAL BUSTER

*   Effects of Continuous Spell and Trap Cards that do not use the Chain remain active. For example, “Gravity Bind” or “Burden of the Mighty” will continue to apply their effects even if “Ritual Buster” is being applied as well.

  
## RISING ENERGY

*   You can activate “Rising Energy” during the damage step.
*   Discarding 1 card is a cost to activate “Rising Energy”.

  
## RITUAL FOREGONE

*   If the Ritual Monster Special Summoned by “Ritual Foregone” is flipped face-down or is removed from play (even temporarily), the effects of “Ritual Foregone” are not applied. So the monster can attack this turn, and is not destroyed at the end of this turn.
*   Even if “Non-Spellcasting Area” is active, a Ritual Monster that is not an Effect Monster (such as “Hungry Burger”) will still be affected by the restrictions on “Ritual Foregone”. So it still cannot attack and it is still destroyed at the end of this turn.
*   Even though only 1 copy of this card can be activated each turn, you can chain “Serial Spell” to it to duplicate the effect.
*   If “Destiny Hero – Diamond Dude” uses its effect and reveals “Ritual Foregone”, you can still activate another “Ritual Foregone” that same turn.

  
## RITUAL OF DESTRUCTION

*   Removing this card from play is the cost to activate the effect to return destroyed monsters to the Deck.
*   If a Ritual Monster destroys “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6” while the effect of this card is active, “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6” is returned to the Deck.
*   The effect of “Ritual of Destruction” is also applied to Ritual Monsters that are Special Summoned after the effect resolves.
*   You can activate the effect of “Ritual of Destruction” even if you control no Ritual Monsters.
*   You activate the effect of “Ritual of Destruction” during your Main Phase.

  
## RITUAL OF GRACE

*   The Graveyard effect of this card targets 1 Ritual Monster you control.
*   Removing this card from the Graveyard is a cost.
*   You can only activate this effect during your Main Phase.

  
## RITUAL RAVEN

*   This card's effect applies any time it is Tributed for a Ritual Summon, including from your hand or while face-down on the field.
*   This card's effect is optional. You may also count it as a Level 1 monster when Tributing it for a Ritual Summon.
*   This card can be used as the entire Tribute for Ritual Spell Cards that require the Ritual Monster's exact Level in Tributes, like "End of the World" and "Contract with the Abyss".

  
## RITUAL WEAPON

*   The equipped monster's current Level needs to be 6 or less, not original Level.
*   If the equipped Ritual Monster's Level is increased to 7 or more, "Ritual Weapon" is destroyed.

  
## RIVALRY OF WARLORDS  
> Each player sends monsters they control to the Graveyard so that they only control 1 Type of monster. Each player can only control 1 Type of monster.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect applies immediately after this Trap Card’s activation resolves: both players look at the face-up monsters they control and each choose 1 Type to keep and send their face-up monsters that aren’t that Type to the Graveyard.
    *   If a face-down with a different Type is attacked, it is flipped face-up in Substep 2 - Flip Face-Down, and is sent to the Graveyard at the start of Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation. Flip Effects will still activate, but effects that trigger when the monster is destroyed by battle will not.
*   While this effect applies, and you control a face-up monster, YOU CANNOT:
    *   Flip / Normal / Special Summoning a monster of a different Type.
    *   Ritual Summon a monster of a different Type by Tributing the face-up monster(s).
    *   Fusion/Synchro Summon a monster of a different Type using the face-up monster(s) as Material.
    *   Tribute your opponent's monsters to Summon "Lava Golem", UNLESS they are all Fiend-Type.
*   While this effect applies:
    *   You can Tribute Summon a monster of any Type by Tributing your only face-up monster(s). Konami's reversal of this ruling was delivered months after SJC Edison \[[REF](https://web.archive.org/web/20120427230353/http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/gameplay/card_faq1.html)\].
    *   You can Set / Tribute Set / Special Summon monsters face-down of any Type.
    *   You can activate and resolve "Creature Swap" & "Brain Control". If an exchanged monster's Type differs from those already face-up on that field, it is immediately sent to the Graveyard.
    *   You can activate cards that Summon multiple monsters (if you have no face-up monsters). All of them are Summoned, then you pick one Type and send all others to the Graveyard.
*   VS. "Gladiator Beasts": Your Glad Beasts can tag out (return to your Deck) as long as there is another Gladiator Beast in your Deck of the correct Type that you COULD Summon. However, if you have no face-up monsters when the effect resolves, you can Summon a Glad Beast of any Type.
*   VS. Uria, Lord of Searing Flames: You cannot Special Summon Uria by sending Rivalry + 2 face-up Continuous Traps to the Graveyard unless you control no face-up monsters Pyro-Type monsters.

  
## ROAR OF THE EARTHBOUND

*   This effect starts a Chain. It targets the 1 opponent’s monster that has declared an attack.
*   If you do not destroy the monster with this effect, you do not inflict damage to your opponent.
*   Destroying the monster and inflicting damage are considered to happen at the same time.
*   If the attacking monster’s ATK is higher than your “Earthbound Immortal” monster’s ATK when this effect resolves, the monster is not destroyed.
*   This effect activates automatically the first time an opponent’s monster with less ATK than your “Earthbound Immortal” monster attacks.

  
## ROBBIN' GOBLIN  
> Each time a monster you control inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent, your opponent discards 1 random card.

*   This is a mandatory effect. It activates even if your opponent has no cards in hand.
*   This effect will not activate if you inflict 0 Battle Damage.
*   This effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation (like "Don Zaloog").

  
## ROC FROM THE VALLEY OF HAZE

*   Because this effect is a mandatory Trigger Effect, you cannot "miss the timing" with it.
*   So even if you send "Roc from the Valley of Haze" to the Graveyard as a cost, or in the middle of a chain, it will still be shuffled into your Deck (after resolving the current series of events).

  
## ROCKET JUMPER

*   If your opponent has only Defense Position monsters on the field, you can attack directly with "Rocket Jumper", but if your opponent has a Spell or Trap Card, you cannot attack directly with "Rocket Jumper".

  
## ROCKET PILDER

*   This effect activates at the end of the Damage Step and starts a Chain. If a monster’s ATK is reduced by “Rocket Pilder” and then is affected by “Shrink,” the ATK of the monster becomes half of the original ATK.
*   If “Rocket Pilder” is negated after it reduces a monster’s ATK, that monster’s ATK does not go back to normal.
*   If “Rocket Pilder” is destroyed after it reduces a monster’s ATK, that monster’s ATK does not go back to normal.
*   Even if the equipped monster destroys its attack target, “Rocket Pilder’s” effect starts a Chain.

  
## ROCKSTONE WARRIOR

*   If you attack with “Rockstone Warrior” and your opponent activates “Dimension Wall,” you still stake no damage from the attack, due to “Rockstone Warrior’s” effect.
*   You cannot use “Rockstone Tokens” for a Tribute Set because that is still a Tribute Summon.

  
## ROD OF SILENCE - KAY'EST

*   When you equip "Rod of Silence - Kay'est" to a monster equipped with other Equip Spell Cards, those cards are destroyed.

  
## ROD OF THE MIND'S EYE

*   The damage caused by "Rod of the Mind's Eye" is Battle Damage, so it can be reduced to zero with "Waboku" or "Kuriboh".
*   When you equip "Rod of the Mind's Eye" to "Susa Soldier" or "Shadowknight Archfiend", the Battle Damage is 1000 points.
*   When "Gravekeeper's Vassal" is equipped with "Rod of the Mind's Eye", the effect is not activated because the damage caused by "Gravekeeper's Vassal" is effect damage.

  
## ROPE OF LIFE

*   Discarding your hand is a cost and the cost must be at least 1 card. So if you have zero cards in your hand, you cannot activate "Rope of Life".
*   If your monster is controlled by your opponent and sent to your Graveyard, you can activate "Rope of Life". You cannot activate "Rope of Life" when your opponent’s monster you control is sent to his/her Graveyard.
*   The increase in ATK is permanent as long as the monster remains face-up on the field.
*   You can use "Rope of Life" to Special Summon "Jinzo" and "Jinzo"'s ATK will increase by 800 points.

  
## ROSE FAIRY

*   This effect cannot be activated during the Damage Step.

  
## ROSE TENTACLES

*   The restriction against Special Summoning “Rose Tentacles” is not an ‘effect’.
*   The effect of “Rose Tentacles” to inflict damage happens at the end of the Damage Step.
*   You can combine the effect of “Rose Tentacles” with “Wonder Clover:”
*   If your opponent controls 0 Plants, “Rose Tentacles” could attack twice. If your opponent controls 1 Plant, “Rose Tentacles” could attack twice.
*   If your opponent controls 2 Plants, “Rose Tentacles” could attack 3 times
*   . If “Rose Tentacles” gains extra attacks at the start of your Battle Phase, but is then flipped face-down or temporarily leaves the field before it attacks, it can only attack once during that Battle Phase after it returns or is flipped face-up again.
*   The number of attacks that “Rose Tentacles” can perform is determined at the start of the Battle Phase.
*   If the number of Plants changes, the number of attacks “Rose Tentacles” can perform doesn’t change.

  
## ROULETTE BARREL

*   You can only use "Roulette Barrel"'s effect once per turn.
*   You have to roll a die twice, not once. You must roll the die twice in a row, not once in Main Phase 1 and once in Main Phase 2, etc.
*   You CAN select a die roll result which doesn't match the Level Stars of a face-up monster. But if the die roll you select does match a monster, you MUST destroy a face-up monster with the correct number of Level Stars.
*   "Roulette Barrel" can destroy itself with its effect.
*   You cannot destroy a monster with 7 or more stars with "Roulette Barrel"'s effect.

  
## ROYAL COMMAND

*   This card can be chained to the activation of a Flip Effect from a Flip Summon to negate the Flip Effect. It cannot be activated during the Damage Step, so if a Flip Effect Monster is flipped face-up when attacked you cannot chain "Royal Command" to negate its Flip Effect.
*   If "Royal Command" is active on the field both players may still Flip Summon monsters, but any Flip Effects are negated.

  
## ROYAL DECREE  
> Negate the effects of all other Trap Cards on the field.

*   Trap Cards (and their effects) can still be activated (played face-up).
*   This effect negates the effects of Trap Cards that activate & resolve on the field.
    *   The effect of a Trap Card sent by a chained "[Emergency Provisions](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Emergency_Provisions)" is still negated.
*   This effect does not negate the effects of Trap Cards that activate in the Graveyard (like "Dark Coffin").

  
## ROYAL FIRESTORM GUARDS

*   "Royal Firestorm Guards" targets the selected Pyro-Type monsters in your Graveyard.

  
## ROYAL KEEPER

*   The effect of "Royal Keeper" is not a Flip Effect.
*   When a face-down "Royal Keeper" is attacked and flipped face-up, its +300 ATK effect is applied AFTER damage calculation.
*   When your opponent activates "Bottomless Trap Hole" against "Royal Keeper", the +300 ATK effect of "Royal Keeper" resolves after "Bottomless Trap Hole".

  
## ROYAL KNIGHT

*   For its effect to activate, “Royal Knight” must be on the field when the monster it destroyed is sent to the Graveyard. Its effect will not activate if it battles a monster with equal ATK and they are both destroyed.

  
## ROYAL MAGICAL LIBRARY

*   You place a Spell Counter on this card when the Spell Card resolves, so if "Magic Jammer" is used to negate the Spell Card's activation then you do not place a Spell Counter on this monster. But if "Imperial Order" is chained to the Spell Card, you still place a Spell Counter on this monster because the activation of the Spell Card was not negated. If the Spell Card was a Continuous, Equip, or Field Spell Card, and “Dust Tornado” is chained to its activation and destroys it before it resolves you still place a Spell Counter because the activation of the card was not negated.
*   "Royal Magical Library" must be face-up on the field when the Spell Card is activated in order to get a Spell Counter.

  
## ROYAL OPPRESSION  
> ① Either player can pay 800 Life Points to negate the Special Summon of a monster(s), and/or an effect that Special Summons a monster(s), and destroy those cards.

*   The ① Quick-like Effect activates & resolves on the field, so long as this card is face-up.
    *   This Card / Effect can't be activated in the Damage Step.
    *   Paying 800 Life Points is a cost.
    *   This effect can be used when "Royal Oppression" is activated (flipped face-up) \[[REF](https://web.archive.org/web/20090211060949/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1263911.aspx)\].
    *   This effect can activate in the Summon negation timing (like "Black Horn of Heaven") \[[REF](https://web.archive.org/web/20090211060949/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1263911.aspx)\].
    *   This effect can activate in response to the activation of a Card / Effect that would perform a Special Summon (ex: "Debris Dragon", "Miracle Fusion", "Call of the Haunted") \[[REF](https://web.archive.org/web/20090211060949/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1263911.aspx)\].
    *   This effect can negate the effect of a card that, when intially activated, might perform a Special Summon (Ex: "Macro Cosmos", "Future Fusion", and "Starlight Road") \[[REF1](https://web.archive.org/web/20090211060949/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1263911.aspx), [REF2](https://web.archive.org/web/20080827211228/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1264284.aspx)\].
    *   This effect can negate the activated effect of a card that would result in a Special Summon (like "Geartown", "Black Garden", "Future Visions") \[[REF1](https://web.archive.org/web/20090211060949/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1263911.aspx), [REF2](https://web.archive.org/web/20080827211228/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/community/forums/thread/1264284.aspx)\].
    *   A Trap Monster, activated while "Imperial Custom" applies, whose effect to Special Summon itself is negated "Royal Oppression" stays in the Spell / Trap Card Zone meaninglessly \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board//showthread.php?p=14930312)\].
*   If "Royal Oppression" is activated (flipped face-up) but its Quick-like Effect was not activated, it cannot be activated in that same chain, since the card itself has not yet resolved.

  
## ROYAL TRIBUTE  
> This card can only be activated when "Necrovalley" is on your side of the field. Both players discard all Monster Cards in their hands to the Graveyard.

*   Both players must reveal their hands to the opponent when "Royal Tribute" resolves.
*   "Necrovalley" only needs to be face-up on the field when this card is activated.
*   This effect resolves successfully even if "Necrovalley" leaves the field in the Chain.

  
## ROYAL WRIT OF TAXATION

*   If the selected card is a Monster Card, the card (or 1 with the same name) has to be Normal Summoned for “Royal Writ of Taxation’s” effect to apply. If it is Set, Special Summoned, or Flip Summoned then the effect will not apply.
*   “Activated” in the text of “Royal Writ of Taxation” means to activate a Spell or Trap Card, or to activate the effect of a Spell, Trap, or Effect Monster. So a face-down “Ojamagic” being destroyed, the effect of an already face-up “Ultimate Offering” being activated, or the Flip Effect of a “Magician of Faith” activating would all cause “Royal Writ of Taxation’s” effect to be applied.

  
## RUTHLESS DENIAL

*   You must select 1 monster you control when you activate this card.
*   Sending the targeted monster to the Graveyard is part of this card's effect. If that monster is removed from the field by an effect chained to "Ruthless Denial", the effect to discard 1 card from your opponent's hand will not be applied.
*   If an effect chained to "Ruthless Denial" reduces the cards in your opponent's hand to 0, "Ruthless Denial"'s effect cannot be applied, so you do not send the targeted monster to the Graveyard.
*   Both cards are considered to be sent to the Graveyard simulataneously.

  
## RYKO, LIGHTSWORN HUNTER
> FLIP: Ⓐ You can destroy 1 card on the field. Ⓑ Send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard.

*   The Flip Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   If flipped in the Damage Step, this effect activates in Substep 6 - Resolve Effects.
    *   This effect resolves sequentially: Ⓐ destroy the target (if once was selected), then Ⓑ mill the top 3 cards of your Deck.
    *   If you want to destroy 1 card, target 1 card (face-up / face-down) on the field at activation.
    *   Milling 3 cards from the top of your Deck is always the last thing to happen. This can cause some effects to miss their activation timing (such as "Geartown" and "Dimensional Alchemist").
*   Example: Player A Flip Summons "Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter" and targets Player B's "Dimensional Alchemist". First, "Dimensional Alchemist" is destroyed, and afterwards Player A sends the top three cards of their deck to the Graveyard, among which was "Peten the Dark Clown". The last thing to happen was Player A sending the top three cards of their Deck to the Graveyard. Alchemist's trigger effect has missed its activation timing, but Peten may activate its effect.

> Konami policy regarding card legality and cards with [erratas](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Errata) (section IX. subsection G. of the [policy document](https://img.yugioh-card.com/en/gameplay/penalty_guide/YGOTCG_Policy_v_2_1.pdf)) state that "you are required to play all copies of your cards according to the most recent text". Therefore, the language used and the consequences of this erratum are essential to authentic Edison Format play.

  
## RYU KOKKI  
> ① If this card battles a Warrior or Spellcaster-Type monster, destroy that monster at the end of the Damage Step.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   If "Ryu Kokki" was destroyed by battle, this effect still activates.
    *   The monster's current Type must be Warrior / Spellcaster in order for this effect to activate.
*   VS. "Goyo Guardian": The effects of "Goyo Guardian" and "Ryu Kokki" form a single chain during Substep 7 of the Damage Step when they battle. Kokki's mandatory trigger effect will be Chain Link 1 \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=627818)\].
*   If "Ryu Kokki" battles with "Dark Magician of Chaos", "Ryu Kokki" is destroyed and removed from play by "Dark Magician of Chaos"' effect, and "Dark Magician of Chaos" is removed from play because it is destroyed by "Ryu Kokki"'s effect and removed by its own effect.

  
## RYU SENSHI

*   This card’s effect that negates Spell Cards that target it is not optional.
*   You can Special Summon this card from the Graveyard with "Monster Reborn" because its effect that negates Spell Cards is not active while it is in the Graveyard (but only if was properly Fusion Summoned originally).
*   A Spell Card that targets this card may be activated, but it will be negated and destroyed.
*   The effect of this card will not negate "Creature Swap", "Fissure", "Smashing Ground", "Dark Hole", "Raigeki", or similar cards that do not target.
*   If you try to equip "Fusion Sword Murasame Blade" to this monster, it will be negated and destroyed.

  
## RYU-KISHIN CLOWN

*   If "Ryu-Kishin Clown" is Special Summoned face-down, its effect does not activate.



## SABER HOLE  
> Activate only while you control a face-up "X-Saber" monster. Negate the Summon of a monster, and destroy it.

*   You must control a face-up XX-Saber or X-Saber monster in order to activate this card.
*   This card activates in the Summon negation timing (like “Horn of Heaven” and “Black Horn of Heaven”).
*   This effect does not target.
*   This can negate Normal Summons, Flip Summons, Special Summons (like "Chaos Sorcerer"), Synchro Summons, and Contact Fusion Summons (like "Gladiator Beast Gyzarus").
*   This can negate the Summon performed after an effect resolves as Chain Link 1 (ex: "Ultimate Offering").
*   This cannot negate effects that perform a Special Summon (ex: "Polymerization", "Blackwing - Vayu the Emblem of Honor").

  
## SABER SLASH  
> Destroy a number of face-up cards on the field equal to the number of face-up Attack Position "X-Saber" monsters you control.

*   This effect does not target.
*   Count your face-up Attack Position XX-Saber & X-Saber monsters when “Saber Slash” resolves.
*   If the only face-up cards on the field when “Saber Slash” resolves are your own face-up Attack Position “X-Saber” monsters, you must destroy them. “Saber Slash” cannot destroy itself.
*   VS. "My Body as a Shield": "My Body as a Shield" can only be activated if it is certain that "Sabre Slash" will destroy at least 1 monster on the field \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=814158)\].
    *   Example A: Your opponent has 2 "X-Sabre" monsters, no face-up Spell / Trap Cards, and activates "Saber Slash". You you have one face-up monster, a Set "My Body as a Shield", and a face-up "Skill Drain". "Sabre Slash" is guaranteed to destroy two cards, and there's at most one non-monster that it can destroy. Therefore, you can activate "My Body as a Shield" in response.
    *   Example B: Your opponent activates "Saber Slash" while controlling 1 "X-Sabre" monster and 5 face-up Spell Cards. You control one face-up monster and a Set "My Body as a Shield". Because your opponent can choose to destroy any of their face-up cards with "Sabre Slash", you cannot activate "My Body as a Shield" in response.
*   VS. "Starlight Road": "Starlight Road" can only be activated if it is certain that a card/effect would destroy two+ cards you control. However, your opponent always has the option of destroying the face-up "X-Sabre" monster(s) that they control, so "Starlight Road" can NEVER be used \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=814158)\].
    *   VS. Your own "Starlight Road": If you control 3 "X-Saber" monsters and your opponent controls 1 face-up card, when you play "Saber Slash" it is certain that at least 2 of your "X-Saber" monsters will be destroyed, so you can activate "Starlight Road" in response to your own "Saber Slash" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=814158)\].
*   VS. "Stardust Dragon": "Sabre Slash" destroys a card(s) on the field, so Stardust can activate \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=814158)\].

  
## SACRED PHOENIX OF NEPHTHYS

*   You can activate "Divine Wrath" when "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" is Special Summoned by its own effect. Because this effect activates in the Graveyard, and is being negated while "Sacred Phoenix of Nepthys" is in the Graveyard, "Sacred Phoenix of Nepthys" is never Special Summoned (so the card is never moved from the Graveyard) and is never destroyed. Because it is not destroyed, its effect to Special Summon itself does not activate again.
*   If "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" is Special Summoned with "Call of the Haunted" or "Premature Burial", and that card is destroyed and destroys "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" with its effect, you Special Summon "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" during your next Standby Phase because it was destroyed by a card effect.
*   If "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" is destroyed while in your hand or Deck by a card effect, you still activate its effect during your next Standby Phase to Special Summon it from the Graveyard. (For example, if an effect like "Star Boy" is active, and "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" is Summoned, and "Chain Destruction" is activated to destroy other copies of "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" in the hand and Deck, those copies will be Special Summoned during your next Standby Phase.
*   If "Skill Drain" is active on the field, the effect of "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" that Special Summons it from the Graveyard is still activated, because it is activated in the Graveyard. However, the effect that destroys Spell and Trap Cards on the field is negated because it activates on the field (so "Skill Drain" and other Spell and Trap Cards on the field are not destroyed in this case).
*   If "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" is Summoned (except by its effect), and the Summon is negated by "Horn of Heaven", it is Special Summoned during your next Standby Phase because it was destroyed by a card effect. When it is Special Summoned by its own effect, “Horn of Heaven” or “Solemn Judgment” cannot be activated, because it is being Summoned by its own Trigger Effect, not by a built-in “this is how you Summon this monster” effect.
*   If your opponent controls your "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys", and it is destroyed by a card effect, because the effect activates in the Graveyard, it is the owner that gets the effect and Special Summons "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" during their Standby Phase.
*   If "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" is destroyed during your Draw Phase, you can Special Summon it during the Standby Phase of that same turn.
*   If "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" is destroyed and removed from play, such as with "Bottomless Trap Hole", it is not Special Summoned from out of play during the Standby Phase, because this effect activates in the Graveyard.
*   If "Rivalry of Warlords" is active, and your opponent takes control of your "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" while controlling monsters that are not Winged Beast-Type, "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" is not considered destroyed by the effect of "Rivalry of Warlords", but rather by a condition that made it impossible for it to exist on that side of the field. So it is not Special Summoned by its own effect during the Standby Phase.
*   If "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" is destroyed while it is not a Monster Card, such as when it is equipped to "Relinquished" or "Sword Hunter", its effect does not activate and it is not Special Summoned
*   You can chain to the effect of "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" that destroys all Spell and Trap Cards.
*   If "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" is Special Summoned by its effect during the Standby Phase, and "Card of Safe Return" is on the field, "Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys" is Step 1 of the chain and "Card of Safe Return" is Step 2, so "Card of Safe Return" resolves first and you draw a card before "Card of Safe Return" is destroyed.

  
## SAGE OF SILENCE

*   This effect activates at the same time that the monster destroyed by battle is sent to the Graveyard.

## SAKURETSU ARMOR

## SALVAGE  
> Add 2 WATER monsters in your Graveyard with an ATK of 1500 or less each to your hand.

*   "Salvage" targets 2 WATER monsters in the Graveyard.
*   If 1 of the targeted WATER monsters is removed from the Graveyard by an effect chained to "Salvage", the remaining WATER monster is still added to your hand.

  
## SAMSARA

*   The effect of “Samsara” does not start a chain. The Tributed monsters will be shuffled into the Deck immediately, instead of being sent to the Graveyard. Then the Ritual Monster is Special Summoned.
*   If “Samsara” and “Banisher of the Light” are both on the field the monsters Tributed for a Ritual Summon will be shuffled back into the Deck.
*   If “Dark Magician of Chaos” is used as a Tribute for a Ritual Summon while “Samsara” is on the field it will be shuffled back into the Deck.

  
## SAMSARA LOTUS

*   Both of "Samsara Lotus'" effects are Trigger Effects.
*   If you chain a Quick-Play Spell Card from your hand to your "Samsara Lotus'" Special Summon effect, "Samsara Lotus'" effect disappears.
*   If "Book of Moon", etc., is chained to "Samsara Lotus'" damage inflicting effect and flips it face-down, the effect disappears.

  
## SAND MOTH

*   If a face-down “Sand Moth” is attacked by “Mystic Swordsman LV2” or “Sasuke Samurai” its effect will activate. But if it is attacked by “Drillroid” it will not activate since it will be face-up when it is destroyed by the effect of “Drillroid”.
*   If the opponent controls your face-down “Sand Moth” and it is destroyed by a card effect, it will be Special Summoned to the owner’s side of the field.
*   If “Sand Moth” is Special Summoned by its own effect, and then flipped face-down or removed from the field, its original ATK and DEF return to 1000 / 2000.
*   If a face-down “Sand Moth” is targeted by “Acid Trap Hole” its effect will not activate since it will be face-up when it is destroyed.
*   After “Sand Moth” is Special Summoned by its own effect, if you equip it with “Megamorph” you will either halve or double its new (2000) original ATK.
*   After “Sand Moth” is Special Summoned by its own effect, if you activate “Shield & Sword” it will have 1000 ATK / 2000 DEF for that turn.
*   Even if “Skill Drain” is active when “Sand Moth” is Special Summoned by its own effect, its ATK and DEF will remained switched. (2000 ATK / 1000 DEF).

  
## SANGA OF THE THUNDER

*   A marker may be placed on this card to indicate that its effect has been used. The effect resets if the monster is destroyed or removed from the field.
*   You can use the effect of this card even if it is face-down when it is attacked because its effect is activated during the Damage Step, and it will be face-up at that point.
*   The effect of this card targets.

  
## SANGAN  
> ① When this card is sent from the field to the Graveyard, add 1 monster with 1500 or less ATK from your Deck to your hand.

*   This ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   Monsters with "? ATK" cannot be added from Deck to hand.
    *   This effect cannot miss the timing.
    *   This effect activates even if you have no more monsters in Deck.
*   If the Summon of this card is negated with "Horn of Heaven", this effect does not activate.
*   This effect will not trigger if "Sangan" is removed from play (by "Dimensional Fissure", etc.) instead of being sent to the Graveyard.

  
## SANGUINE SWAMP  
> ① If you control any other Spell or Trap Cards, destroy this card. ② Face-down Spell and Trap Cards cannot be activated. ③ Destroy this card during your 2nd Standby Phase after activation.

*   The ①, ②, and ③ Continuous-like Effects do not start a Chain.
*   If you activate "Sanguine Swamp" while you control face-down Spell or Trap Card(s), it is destroyed after it resolves.

  
## SASUKE SAMURAI

*   If "Sasuke Samurai" attacks a face-down monster, apply its effect after entering the Damage Step, but before flipping up the face-down monster. The monster is not flipped. Flip Effects are not activated. Monsters like "Kisetai" and "Giant Axe Mummy" do not activate their effects.
*   If "Sasuke Samurai" attacks a face-down monster, there is no damage calculation. "Sasuke Samurai" destroys the monster before damage calculation is reached.
*   If "Sasuke Samurai" destroys a face-down monster using its effect, the face-down monster is NOT "destroyed as a result of battle", it is destroyed by "Sasuke Samurai"’s effect. So "Mystic Tomato", "Helpoemer", etc. will not activate their effects. However, monsters like "Sangan" will still activate their effects.
*   If "Sasuke Samurai" attacks a face-down monster, and "Ceasefire" is activated during the Battle Step to flip it face-up, "Sasuke Samurai" does not destroy it with its effect and damage calculation is applied normally. The monster must be face-down at the beginning of the Damage Step in order for "Sasuke Samurai" to activate its effect.

  
## SASUKE SAMURAI #2  
> ① Once per turn, during your Main Phase, you can pay 800 Life Points. If you do this, until the End Phase, Spell and Trap Cards cannot be activated.

*   You can only activate "Sasuke Samurai #2"'s effect once per turn.
*   The effect of "Sasuke Samurai #2" stops in the End Phase, and after the effect ends, you can activate Trap Cards or Quick-Play Spell Cards during the remainder of the End Phase.
*   While "Sasuke Samurai #2"'s effect is active, you can't activate the effects of cards that activate in the Graveyard like "Black Pendant" and "Statue of the Wicked".
*   You cannot activate the effects of Continuous cards like "Skull Lair", "Ultimate Offering", or "Mass Driver" while "Sasuke Samurai #2"'s effect is active.

  
## SASUKE SAMURAI #4

*   You activate the effect of "Sasuke Samurai #4" at the beginning of the Damage Step, before the monster is flipped face-up.

*   If "Sasuke Samurai #4" attacks a face-up Attack Position "Reflect Bounder", the effect of "Sasuke Samurai #4" is resolved before the effect of "Reflect Bounder".

  
## SAUROPOD BRACHION

*   “You cannot Special Summon this card” and “You can Tribute Summon this card by Tributing 1 Dinosaur-Type monster” are not effects. You can Tribute a face-down Dinosaur-Type monster to Tribute Summon this card.

  
## SAVAGE COLOSSEUM

*   The effect of gain Life Points and the effect to destroy monsters both start a Chain.
*   Monsters that are unaffected by Spell Cards, such as “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6,” do not have to attack and are not destroyed if they do not attack.
*   If an attacking monster is removed from the field before the end of the Damage Step, the monster’s controller will not gain Life Points.
*   The player who controls the monster at the end of the Damage Step is the one who will gain Life Points.

*   The effect to destroy monsters activates every End Phase even if there aren’t any monsters that did not declare an attack.
*   If a monster is Special Summoned during the End Phase after the effect of “Savage Colosseum” has activated and resolved, the effect of “Savage Colosseum” will not activate again during the same End Phase.
*   The effect of “Savage Colosseum” is activated by its controller.

  
## SCANNER

*   “Scanner” targets 1 removed from play monster, but does not continue to target after the effect resolves. If “Scanner” is removed from the field while it is not copying another monster (example: if it is destroyed during your opponent’s turn), it is not removed from play.
*   If “Skill Drain” is activated after the effect of “Scanner” resolves, the effect of “Scanner” is still applied, and “Scanner” will still be removed from play if it leaves the field.
*   If the target of “Scanner” is no longer in the removed zone when the effect of “Scanner” resolves, then “Scanner” does not copy that monster, and “Scanner” will not be removed from play if it leaves the field.

  
## SCAPEGOAT

*   If your opponent chains "Magic Jammer" to your "Scapegoat" you may still perform Summons that turn, but if they chain "Imperial Order" you may not perform Summons.
*   You may offer Sheep Tokens as Tributes for Toon Monsters, since they are Special Summoned and not Tribute Summoned.
*   If the effect of "Royal Oppression" is chained to your "Scapegoat" your Sheep Tokens will not be Special Summoned and you still cannot perform any Summons that turn.
*   If you have already Summoned a monster, including a Special Summon caused by the effect of your opponent’s "Cyber Jar" you cannot activate "Scapegoat".
*   You can Set a monster in the same turn you activate "Scapegoat".
*   If you control 2 monsters and your opponent activates "Change of Heart" to gain control of one and you later activate "Scapegoat" your monster will be destroyed during the End Phase if all 5 of your Monster Card Zones are still occupied.
*   If you activate "Monster Reborn" and your opponent chains "Imperial Order" you can chain "Scapegoat" and "Royal Decree" but only "Scapegoat" will resolve since "Scapegoat" will prevent any Special Summons, and therefore "Monster Reborn" cannot resolve.

  
## SCARY MOTH

*   Monsters Special Summoned before “Scary Moth” is Summoned do not count for this effect.
*   If you activate “Monster Reborn” while “Scary Moth” and “Black Garden” are face-up on your side of the field, you will be able to Special Summon a monster with “Monster Reborn.”
*   The effect of “Black Garden” will activate, but will be unable to Special Summon a “Rose Token.” The effect to halve the ATK of the monster will be applied.
*   If “Scary Moth” is face-up on the field, you can activate “Monster Reborn” and Chain to it with “Call of the Haunted,” but only “Call of the Haunted” will Special Summon a monster.
*   If your opponent has already Special Summoned this turn and “Scary Moth” is face-up on the field, you may activate “The Shallow Grave.” If you do, only you will Special Summon a monster.

*   If you Special Summon “Scary Moth” it does not count as your one Special Summon for the turn.

  
## SCROLL OF BEWITCHMENT

*   If you switch the target of this card with "Collected Power" or "Tailor of the Fickle" you do not select a new Attribute.
*   The newly equipped monster becomes the Attribute that was originally selected when "Scroll of Bewitchment" was activated, even if it is the same as the monster’s original Attribute.

  
## SCRUBBED RAID

*   Sending one other card you control to the Graveyard is a cost to activate the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" which ends the Battle Phase.
*   You can neither activate "Scrubbed Raid" nor activate the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" during the Damage Step.
*   You can activate a Spell or Trap Card as Chain Link 1 and then activate the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" in Chain to the card by sending the activated card to the Graveyard. If the activated card was a Normal Spell Card or a Normal Trap Card, then the effect of the card will resolve properly. If the activated card was an Equip, Continuous, or Field Spell Card or a Continuous Trap Card, then the other card is not on the field when resolving its effect, so the effect of the other card is not applied.
*   If you would activate a Set "Scrubbed Raid", then you can also send one card you control to the Graveyard to also simultaneously activate its effect to end the Battle Phase.
*   You cannot activate the effect of a face-up "Scrubbed Raid" multiple times in the same Chain.
*   You can activate the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" during your own Battle Phase's Start Step or Battle Step, but you cannot activate the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" during the Damage Step or End Step. Also, if you are only activating a Set "Scrubbed Raid" to make it face-up on the field, then you can activate "Scrubbed Raid" during the End Step.
*   If the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" is activated when a monster declares an attack, then the Battle Phase ends, so the attacking monster can no longer be treated as an "attacking monster".
*   If the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" is activated in Chain to an effect like "Dimensional Prison", then the effect of "Dimensional Prison" is not applied, and the attacking monster remains on the field.
*   If the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" is activated in Chain to "Magic Cylinder", then the Battle Phase ends",Magic Cylinder" cannot negate the attack so the effect of inflicting damage equal to the monster's ATK is not applied.
*   The effect of "Mirror Force" only destroys all monsters in Attack Position, so all Attack Position monsters will still be destroyed even if the effect of "Scrubbed Raid" ends the Battle Phase.

  
## SEA DRAGON LORD GISHILNODON  
> ① When a face-up Level 3 or lower monster on the field is sent to the Graveyard, this card's ATK becomes 3000 until the End Phase of this turn.

*   If “Sea Dragon Lord Gishilnodon’s” effect activates, and later “Skill Drain” is activated, “Sea Dragon Lord Gishilnodon” drops to 2300 ATK again. Even if “Skill Drain” is destroyed after that, “Sea Dragon Lord Gishilnodon” remains at 2300 ATK until its effect is triggered again.
*   If “Sea Dragon Lord Gishilnodon” has its ATK altered by a Field Spell Card, etc., and then its effect is triggered, its ATK becomes 3000.
*   If an effect that would alter its ATK is activated afterwards, its ATK will be re-adjusted from 3000 (so it would be 3000 plus or minus the new adjustment).
*   If “Sea Dragon Lord Gishilnodon” has its ATK halved by “Blackwing – Gale the Whirlwind,” and then its effect is triggered and it gets 3000 ATK, after the turn ends its ATK reverts to normal (2300, plus any other continuous effects like Field Spell Cards).
*   “Sea Dragon Lord Gishilnodon’s” DEF will remain halved by “Blackwing – Gale the Whirlwind.” “Sea Dragon Lord Gishilnodon” activates its effect when a monster is sent to the Graveyard that was Level 3 or lower on the field and Level 3 or lower in the Graveyard.
*   If a Level 4 monster that is Level 3 because of “A Legendary Ocean” is sent to the Graveyard, the effect of “Sea Dragon Lord Gishilnodon” does not activate.

  
## SEA KOALA

*   If an effect is chained to "Sea Koala"'s effect that removes every other Beast-Type monster from your side of the field, the effect of "Sea Koala" disappears.
*   After making the ATK of 1 of your opponent's monsters 0, the ATK of the opponent's monster remains 0 until the End Phase. even if every other Beast-Type monster you control is removed from the field.

  
## SEAL OF WICKEDNESS

*   This effect targets 1 face-up card on the field. It targets that card continuously throughout the turn.
*   Paying 500 Life Points is a cost, not an effect. It cannot be negated by “Royal Decree.”
*   If you target a “Gladiator Beast” monster with this effect, and your opponent returns it to the Deck to activate its effect, the effect will still be negated and the “Gladiator Beast” monster will remain in the Deck.
*   If “Seal of Wickedness” targets itself, it will be negated for 1 turn. You can flip “Seal of Wickedness” and activate its effect in the same Chain.
*   If “Seal of Wickedness” is destroyed, removed from the field, or negated while it is negating a card, its effects will no longer be applied and the selected card will no longer be negated.
*   The effect to negate a card starts a Chain in the Standby Phase. It is a mandatory effect.

  
## SEARCHLIGHTMAN

*   If “Searchlightman’s” Flip Effect is activated, and then later “Cyber Jar’s” Flip Effect is activated, all appropriate monsters picked-up by your opponent will have to be Special Summoned in face-up Attack Position.
*   After “Searchlightman’s” effect has resolved, your opponent could not Normal Summon “Mystic Swordsman LV4” or LV6 because they have to be Normal Summoned in face-down Defense Position, which is considered a Set.
*   If your opponent attacks your face-down Defense Position “Searchlightman” with “Inferno Hammer”, the Flip Effect will resolve before it is sent to the Graveyard, so the effect of “Inferno Hammer” cannot activate.

  
## SECOND COIN TOSS

*   The effect of this card only applies when you perform a coin toss, not when your opponent performs a coin toss.
*   If an effect requires multiple coin flips, like "Barrel Dragon", you would redo all 3 coin flips.
*   Even if multiple "Second Coin Toss" cards are active, you can only redo each coin toss once.
*   Even if the original coin toss came out in your favor, you may use the effect of "Second Coin Toss" and redo the toss.

  
## SECOND GOBLIN  
> ① Once per turn, you can equip this card to an "Indomitable Fighter Lei Lei" you control, OR unequip it to Special Summon this card in face-up Attack Position. ② When equipped to a monster by this card's effect, you can change that monster's battle position once per turn. Ⓒ (A monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the equipped monster would be destroyed by battle, destroy this card instead.)

*   The effect of changing a monster's Battle Position can only be used once per turn.

  
## SECRET BARREL

*   If you activate "Secret Barrel" and your opponent activates something as a chain, the chained card is included in the number (so if your opponent's only card on the field or in his hand is "Mystical Space Typhoon", and he chains "Mystical Space Typhoon" to "Secret Barrel", he still takes 200 damage).
*   Monster Tokens are counted for "Secret Barrel".

  
## SECRET PASS TO THE TREASURES

*   There is no way to have a monster with an ATK above 1000 attack directly using the effect of "Secret Pass to the Treasures". When you target a monster with "Secret Pass to the Treasures", and the monster’s ATK is increased above 1000 afterwards, the monster cannot attack your opponent’s Life Points directly.
*   If the monster attacks your opponent’s Life Points directly, you cannot use an effect such as "Rush Recklessly" to increase its ATK above 1000 during the attack. If a monster attacks directly using the effect of "Secret Pass to the Treasures", "automatic" increases will not apply ("Super Robolady", etc.). If you use "Secret Pass to the Treasures" on "Injection Fairy Lily", and attack directly, you cannot activate the effect of "Injection Fairy Lily".
*   You cannot activate "Secret Pass to the Treasures" during Main Phase 2 or on the very first turn.
*   This card targets a monster.

  
## SECRET VILLAGE OF THE SPELLCASTERS  
> ① If you control a Spellcaster-Type monster and your opponent does not, your opponent cannot activate Spell Cards. ② If you control no Spellcaster-Type monsters, you cannot activate Spell Cards.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect does not activate.

*   This card’s effect will still activate if your opponent has only 1 or less card in their hand when the selected monster inflicts Battle Damage.
*   If your opponent has only 1 card in their hand when this card’s effect resolves, they discard that 1 card.
*   If multiple copies of this card are activated targeting the same monster, their effects all go on the Chain when that monster inflicts Battle Damage.
*   If “Secrets of the Gallant” selects a Gemini Monster that is being treated as a Normal Monster and the Gemini Monster is Normal Summoned to turn on its effects, the effect of “Secrets of the Gallant” is still applied when the Gemini Monster inflicts battle damage to the opponent’s Life Points that turn.

  
## SEED CANNON

*   Placing a Plant Counter on this card does not start a chain. Sending “Seed Cannon” to the Graveyard is a cost.
*   If there are no Plant Counters on “Seed Cannon”, you cannot activate its effect and send it to the Graveyard.

  
  
## SELF-DESTRUCT BUTTON

*   If you activate "Self-Destruction Button", and an effect is chained so that the different in Life Points is less than 7000, "Self-Destruction Button" still resolves because its conditions were correct at the time of activation.

  
## SENET SWITCH

*   If “Ojama Trio” is chained to the effect of “Senet Switch” so that the designated Monster Card Zone is now occupied, the effect of “Senet Switch” is not applied and the monster does not move.

  
## SENRI EYE

*   You cannot use "Senri Eye"'s effect more than once during the same Standby Phase.
*   You can use the effect of "Senri Eye" if the top card on the Deck is face-up (due to "Convulsion of Nature" or "Parasite Paracide"), and in that case you don't hide the card from your opponent.

  
## SERIAL SPELL

*   "Serial Spell" must be chained to the activation of your Normal Spell Card. Nothing can be chained in-between by yourself or your opponent. If your opponent chains to your Normal Spell Card, you cannot chain "Serial Spell" to that Normal Spell Card. Because of this, it is impossible to chain 2 copies of "Serial Spell" to the same Normal Spell Card.
*   "Serial Spell" does not target a card.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to a Normal Spell Card that targets a card(s) you can select a different target(s) for the "Serial Spell" copy of the Normal Spell Card.
*   Discarding your hand is a cost to activate "Serial Spell". You cannot activate "Serial Spell" if it is the only card in your hand, or if it is Set and you have no cards in your hand.
*   "Serial Spell" only copies the effects of your Normal Spell Card, not any costs of that Spell Card. So if you chain "Serial Spell" to "Delinquent Duo" you do not pay an additional 1000 Life Points.
*   If you activate "Monster Reborn", and chain "Serial Spell", discarding your entire hand, you can select and revive one of the monsters you discarded for the cost of "Serial Spell" to be the monster that "Serial Spell" Special Summons to the field. (For example, if you target "Dark Magician" with "Monster Reborn", then chain "Serial Spell" and discard "Buster Blader", you can use "Serial Spell" to Special Summon the "Buster Blader" you discarded to activate "Serial Spell".)
*   You cannot level up "Horus the Black Flame Dragon" from 4 to 8 with just "Level Up!" and "Serial Spell". Because you would send "LV4" to the Graveyard for "Level Up!", but even if you copy it with "Serial Spell", the first "Level Up!" hasn't resolved, so "LV6" isn't on the field to send to the Graveyard as a cost for the copy of "Level Up!" If you have "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV4" and "Armed Dragon LV3" on the field, and send one of them to the Graveyard with "Level Up!", you cannot use "Serial Spell" to Level Up the other monster, since there was no monster sent to the Graveyard as a cost for "Serial Spell", and "Serial Spell" would have no point of reference to resolve its effect.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Swords of Revealing Light" it will copy the effect of flipping all monsters face-up, but it will not remain on the field and prevent the opponent from attacking. This is because it is a Quick-Play Spell Card and is sent to the Graveyard after the chain resolves.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Different Dimension Capsule" it will copy the effect and remove 1 card you select in your Deck from play, face-down. But because "Serial Spell" does not remain on the field, the selected card remains removed from play face-down and is not placed in your hand.
*   You can activate "Serial Spell" to copy the effect of a Normal Spell Card, even if it is "Raigeki" or "Soul Exchange" and copying the effect serves no real purpose.
*   If you have 2 monsters in your Graveyard, and your opponent only has 1 monster in their Graveyard, you can activate "The Shallow Grave" and chain "Serial Spell", even though you would not normally be able to activate a second "The Shallow Grave" because your monster would no longer have any monsters in the Graveyard. As a result, you will Special Summon 2 monsters and your opponent will only Special Summon 1 monster.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Bait Doll", the entire effect of "Bait Doll" is applied and "Serial Spell" is also shuffled back into your Deck.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Dragged Down into the Grave", the player who activated "Serial Spell" has no cards in hand, so the effect of "Dragged Down into the Grave" is impossible to resolve, and the effect disappears.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Metamorphosis", there is no effect because you did not Tribute a monster for a cost, so "Serial Spell" has no point of reference and cannot resolve.
*   If you chain "Serial Spell" to "Monster Gate" resolve the effect of "Monster Gate" twice (once for "Serial Spell" and once for "Monster Gate") even though you only pay the cost once (for "Monster Gate").

  
## SERPENTINE PRINCESS

*   When "Serpentine Princess" is returned to the Deck by an effect occurring in a chain, the effect of "Serpentine Princess" starts a new Chain after the current Chain resolves completely.
*   If the effect of "Fiber Jar" places "Serpentine Princess" from the field into your Deck, the effect of "Serpentine Princess" is activated and will be applied after the effect of "Fiber Jar" has finished resolving.

  
## SHADOW DELVER

*   If a monster makes a direct attack using the effect "Shadow Delver", and ceases to be a Level 4 or lower DARK monster after the attack is declared, the attack still continues. No replay occurs.

  
## SHADOW OF EYES

*   "Shadow of Eyes" can be activated when a monster is Special Summoned in face-down Defense Position.
*   "Shadow of Eyes" can be activated when multiple monsters are Special Summoned in face-down Defense Position by the same effect. In this case, select a monster when you activate "Shadow of Eyes".
*   "Shadow of Eyes" can be activated when "Guardian Sphinx" is flipped face-down by its effect.

  
## SHADOW-IMPRISONING MIRROR  
> When the effect of a DARK monster activates on the field or in the Graveyard, negate it.

*   When determining if a monster’s effect should be negated by “Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror”, check the monster’s Attribute at the time its effect is resolved.
*   When a Non-DARK monster’s effect is activated while the monster and “Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror” are both face-up on the field, if you chain “DNA Transplant” and select “DARK”, the monster’s effect will be negated if the monster is still face-up on the field when its effect resolves because it is now a DARK monster.
*   “Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror” cannot negate Unclassified or Continuous Effects of DARK monsters.

  
## SHADOWPRIESTESS OF OHM

*   "Shadowpriestess of Ohm"'s effect is an Ignition Effect.
*   Tributing 1 face-up DARK monster is a cost.

  
## SHADOWSLAYER

*   For "Shadowslayer" (unlike cards like "Black Tyranno" and "Drillago"), only the Monster Card Zones are looked at. If all of your opponent’s monsters are in Defense Position, then "Shadowslayer" can attack directly even if your opponent has Spell and Trap Cards on the field.
*   If "Shadowslayer" attacks a face-up Attack Position monster, and the opponent activates "Book of Moon" so that his only monster on the field is now in Defense Position, a replay occurs, because "Shadowslayer" is now able to attack directly.
*   If all of your opponent’s monsters are in Defense Position but one of them is equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", "Shadowslayer" cannot attack directly and must attack that monster if it attacks.

  
## SHARE THE PAIN

*   Tributing 1 monster you control is a cost.
*   Your opponent decides which monster they Tribute when this effect resolves.
*   No monsters are Summoned by this Tribute.

  
## SHARK CRUISER

*   This effect is a Trigger effect.
*   Even if this card is destroyed during the resolution of a Chain, you can activate its effect after the Chain finishes resolving. It does not “miss the timing.”
*   You cannot activate this effect if you have no Level 4 or lower WATER monsters in your Deck.
*   If your opponent controls your “Shark Cruiser” and destroys it with a card effect you cannot activate the effect of “Shark Cruiser.”

  
## SHIELD & SWORD

*   You can use this card with "Catapult Turtle". In this case, inflict Direct Damage equal to half of the Tribute monster's original DEF to your opponent's Life Points.
*   This card switches the original ATK/DEF only. After this, apply all modifiers to the new ATK/DEF.
*   The effect of this card lasts for your turn only.
*   This card has no effect on "Relinquished" because "Relinquished"'s original ATK/DEF are both zero.
*   If "Shrink" affects a monster affect by "Shield & Sword" after "Shield & Sword"'s effect is applied, its ATK will be half of the switched ATK (ie., half of its original DEF). If "Shield & Sword"'s effect is applied after "Shrink"'s, that monster's ATK will become equal to its original DEF, and its original DEF will be equal to its original ATK (The effect of "Shrink" effectively disappears).

  
## SHIELD CRUSH

*   “Shield Crush” can select and destroy monsters in face-up or face-down Defense Position.
*   “Shield Crush” will only destroy the selected monster if the selected monster is still in Defense Position when “Shield Crush” is resolved. For example, if you select a Defense Position monster to destroy with “Shield Crush” and the monster is changed into Attack Position by another card effect (“Zero Gravity”, etc.), the effect of “Shield Crush” disappears.
*   “Shield Crush” targets the Defense Position monster that is selected when you activate “Shield Crush”. If the selected monster is changed into Attack Position after being selected, it is not possible to select a different monster.

  
## SHIELD WARRIOR

*   "Shield Warrior"'s effect is a Quick Effect. Removing "Shield Warrior" from play is a cost. This effect does not target.
*   You cannot activate "Shield Warrior"'s effect if your monster would not be destroyed by the battle.
*   If a monster you control is forced to battle another monster you control by the effect of your opponent's "Ancient Lamp", when you activate "Shield Warrior"'s effect during damage calculation, both of your monsters are not destroyed.

  
## SHIELD WORM

*   Changing this card to Defense Position and sending cards to your opponent’s Graveyard are both parts of the same Trigger Effect.
*   They occur one after the other, so you would miss the timing to activate “Tragedy.”
*   If you Special Summon this card with “Limit Reverse” you will switch it to Defense Position, send cards from your opponent’s Deck to the Graveyard, and then destroy “Shield Worm” with “Limit Reverse.”

  
## SHIEN'S SPY

*   If you use “Shien’s Spy” on “Silent Swordsman LV5”, it returns to your control during the End Phase as normal.
*   If you chain “Book of Moon” to “Shien’s Spy” to flip the target face-down, the monster still switches to the opponent and returns in the End Phase as normal.
*   If a monster switches sides because of “Shien’s Spy” and is then flipped face-down, it still returns in the End Phase as normal.
*   When a monster returns to the controller during the End Phase for the effect of “Shien’s Spy”, this is not an effect that can be chained to.

  
## SHIFTING SHADOWS

*   If you have only 1 face-down Defense Position monster you cannot activate the effect of "Shifting Shadows".
*   If you control a monster that is targeted by your opponent's "Nightmare Wheel", and you flip it face-down with "Book of Moon", and control at least 1 other face-down Defense Position monster, you can activate the effect of “Shifting Shadows”. However, afterwards you must tell your opponent which monster is targeted by “Nightmare Wheel”.

  
## SHINATO, KING OF A HIGHER PLANE

*   When your "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" destroys "Gradius' Option" or "Maju Garzett", your opponent takes no damage from "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane"'s effect.
*   If "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" is destroyed before monsters are sent to the Graveyard, for example if removed from play by "D. D. Warrior Lady", his effect does not activate. But if "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" attacks "Yomi Ship", "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" inflicts the damage from his effect even though he will be destroyed by "Yomi Ship"'s effect after "Yomi Ship" is sent to the Graveyard.
*   When "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" destroys a Defense Position monster, your opponent can activate "Barrel Behind the Door" as a chain to "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane"'s effect.
*   When your "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" is equipped with "Fairy Meteor Crush" and destroys your opponent's Defense Position monster, first, during damage calculation, "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent's Life Points because of "Fairy Meteor Crush", and then, when the Defense Position monster is sent to the Graveyard, "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane"'s effect inflicts damage equal to the original ATK of the destroyed monster.

  
## SHINING ANGEL

*   If you attack with your "Shining Angel" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you may attack with the monster Special Summoned by "Shining Angel" before entering Main Phase 2.
*   If your opponent controls your "Shining Angel" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you get the effect of "Shining Angel" NOT your opponent.
*   Since the Special Summoning occurs during the Damage Step, "Torrential Tribute", etc. cannot be used.

  
## SHINING SILVER FORCE

*   You can chain “Shining Silver Force” to a Trap Card your opponent activates that inflicts damage to themselves.
*   If a Trap Card that normally gives Life Points has been changed to a damage card by “Bad Reaction to Simochi”, you can activate “Shining Silver Force”.
*   You cannot chain “Shining Silver Force” to a card if you’re not sure it will inflict damage or not (like “The Paths of Destiny).
*   You cannot chain “Shining Silver Force” to the activation of a card that does not inflict damage upon activation but will inflict damage in the future (like “Skull Invitation”).
*   You cannot chain “Shining Silver Force” to a card that shifts battle damage, like “Dimension Wall”.

  
## SHINY BLACK C  
> ① When 1 Synchro Monster is Special Summoned to your opponent's side of the field, you can remove from play this card in the Graveyard to destroy that monster.

*   The ① Quick Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   Removing “Shiny Black C” from play is a cost.
    *   This effect targets the Synchro Monster.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down before this effect resolves, it is not destroyed.
    *   This effect can activate when exactly 1 Synchro Monster is Synchro Summoned or when it is Special Summoned by an effect (by "Call of the Haunted" or "Blackwing - Vayu the Emblem of Honor").
*   You cannot activate this effect during the Damage Step.
*   VS. “Remove Brainwashing”: If you Special Summon your opponent’s Synchro Monster with “Monster Reborn,” control of the monster is immediately shifted to your opponent. The monster is treated as being Special Summoned on your opponent’s side of the field, so you can activate the effect of “Shiny Black C.”

  
## SHIRE, LIGHTSWORN SPIRIT  
> ① This card gains 300 ATK for each "Lightsworn" monster with a different name in your Graveyard. ② During each of your End Phases, send the top 2 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard.

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not start a chain during the Damage Step.
    *   If "Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind" halves this card's ATK, and later the number of "Lightsworn" monsters with different names in your Graveyard changes, this card's ATK will remain the same.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect must resolve (even if the effect is negated) before the turn can end.
    *   If you do not have enough cards to send to the Graveyard remaining in your Deck when resolving this effect, all cards remaining in your Deck are sent to the Graveyard.
    *   If the activation of this effect is negated by "Light and Darkness Dragon", it will activate again in the same End Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
    *   If this effect is negated by "Skill Drain", it will not activate again in the same End Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/137855-end-phase-mandatory-trigger-effects/)\].
    *   The "Lightsworn" monster (or "Judgment Dragon") must remain face-up on the field in order to activate and resolve this effect.
    *   If your opponent activates "Book of Eclipse" after you resolve this effect, when "Book of Eclipse" resolves and your affected monsters are flipped face-up (and you draw 1 card for each) then each "Lightsworn" monster (or "Judgment Dragon") will once again activate this effect \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=678963)\]
*   ② VS. "Brain Control": Player A gains control of Player B's "Lightsworn" monster until the End Phase. During the End Phase, Player A may decide in which order to activate/resolve effects:
    1.  Player A resolves "Brain Control" first, restoring control of the "Lightsworn" monster to Player B. That "Lightsworn" monster is no longer controlled by the turn player, thus its effect will not activate.
    2.  Player A activates and resolves the "Lightsworn" monster's effect to send cards from the top of their Deck to the Graveyard. Then that "Lightsworn" monster is returned to Player B's control \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=653322)\].
*   ② VS. "Enemy Controller":
    *   During Player A's turn, Player B gains control of Player A's "Lightsworn" monster. During the End Phase, when control of the "Lightsworn" monster is restored to Player A, its mandatory Trigger Effect will activate \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/85182-judgment-dragon-and-enemy-controller/)\].

  
## SHOOTING STAR BOW - CEAL

*   "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" decreases the current ATK. So if "Injection Fairy Lily" is equipped with "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" and activates her effect, her ATK is 2400 ((400 - 1000) + 3000 = 2400).
*   If a monster equipped with "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" declares a direct attack, and "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" is removed from the monster during the Battle Step with "Mystical Space Typhoon" or "Tailor of the Fickle", the monster is no longer capable of attacking directly and a replay occurs.
*   "Tyrant Dragon" must attack a monster in order to gain its second attack, so if it is equipped with "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" and attacks directly, it cannot get a second attack. But "Tyrant Dragon" equipped with "Shooting Star Bow - Ceal" can attack a monster, and then attack directly.

  
## SHORT CIRCUIT

*   If an effect is chained that removes 1 or more of the "Batteryman" monsters from your side of the field, "Short Circuit"'s effect still resolves.

  
## SHREDDER

*   Sending the Machine-Type monster to the Graveyard is a cost.
*   This effect targets the monster you want to destroy.
*   If you reduce the Level of the monsters in your hand with “Cost Down” then you can only target monsters whose Level is less than or equal to the monster’s Level in your hand.
    *   Example: “Cyber Dragon” in your hand is being treated as Level 3 with “Cost Down.” You can only send it to the Graveyard as a cost to target a Level 3 or lower monster.
*   If you increase the Level of a monster in your hand with “Level Conversion Lab” you can only send it to the Graveyard to target a monster whose Level is less than or equal to the original Level of the monster in your hand.
    *   Example: “Cyber Dragon” in your hand is being treated as Level 6 with “Level Conversion Lab.” You can only send it to the Graveyard to target a monster that is Level 5 or lower.

  
## SHRINK  
> Select 1 face-up monster on the field. The original ATK of that monster is halved until the end of this turn.

*   This card can be activated during the Damage Step, before Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.
*   This effect target's 1 face-up monster anywhere on the field.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down / leaves the field, it is no longer applied.
    *   This effect refers to the target's original (printed) ATK. Multiple copies of "Shrink" achieve nothing.
    *   After the target's ATK is halved by "Shrink", apply ATK changes from card effects (ex: Equip Spell Cards, Field Spell Cards).
    *   If the target's ATK varies due to a Continuous Effect (ex: "Gren Maju Da Eiza"), that monster’s ATK will be halved. If its ATK changes due to its own effect in the same turn, recalculate the effect of "Shrink" based on the new original ATK. When the effect of “Shrink” wears off, that monster’s ATK will be calculated as normal.
    *   If the target's ATK is set by its effect when it is Summoned (ex: "Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"), its ATK becomes "0", and remains "0" even after the effect of “Shrink” wears off.
*   VS. "Megamorph": If the same monster is targeted by both, the effect that resolved last is applied.

  
## SHUTENDOJI

*   The effect to return a monster to the top of your Deck targets 1 removed from play Zombie-Type monster.
*   Removing from play 2 Zombie-Type monsters in your Graveyard is a cost.

  
## SILENT ABYSS

*   This card’s effect will destroy “Elemental Mistress Doriado”.

  
## SILENT INSECT

*   Changing this card to Defense Position when it is Normal or Flip Summoned is a Trigger Effect. Its other effect is a Continuous Effect.
*   If “Silent Insect” is face-up on the field, you can activate “Skill Drain” by paying 1000 Life Points, but its effect will be negated. If “Skill Drain” is active on the field when you Normal or Flip Summon “Silent Insect”, its effects are negated and it will remain in Attack Position.

  
## SILENT STRIDER

*   "Silent Strider"'s effect is an Ignition Effect. Sending "Silent Strider" to the Graveyard is a cost.
*   "Silent Strider"'s effect targets 1 face-up monster. You cannot select a Level 1 monster.

  
## SILENT SWORDSMAN LV3

*   "Silent Swordsman LV3" will negate the effects of your opponent’s Spell Cards that target it, whether that Spell Card targets just "Silent Swordsman LV3" (such as "Soul Exchange") or multiple monsters ("Different Dimension Gate").

  
## SILENT SWORDSMAN LV5

*   Just like “The Legendary Fisherman” and other monsters that are unaffected by Spell Cards, “Silent Swordsman LV5” can attack normally if your opponent has “Swords of Revealing Light” on the field, and its controller is unaffected by effects like “Toll” and “Gravekeeper’s Servant” when “Silent Swordsman LV5” attacks.
*   If you control “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” and “Silent Swordsman LV5”, and your opponent activates “Fissure”, the monster with the lowest ATK is “Silent Swordsman LV5”, but it is unaffected by Spell Cards, so the effect of “Fissure” disappears.
*   “Silent Swordsman LV5” is unaffected by Spell Cards your opponent controls, including those in your opponent’s hand due to “Exchange” or “Graverobber”.
*   You can Special Summon “Silent Swordsman LV5” with “Autonomous Action Unit”. If “Autonomous Action Unit” is removed from the field, “Silent Swordsman LV5” is unaffected and remains on the field.

  
## SILLVA, WARLORD OF DARK WORLD  
Also see rulings for “Dark World Monsters”.

*   If this card is discarded from your hand by the opponent’s card effect, and they only have 1 card in their hand, then you still can Special Summon “Sillva, Warlord of Dark World”, but the other part of the effect will not resolve because the opponent does not have 2 cards to select.
*   “Sillva, Warlord of Dark World” must be Special Summoned to resolve the second part of his effect. If you cannot Summon him because you activated “Scapegoat” that turn, or your Monster Card Zones are full, then the second part of his effect does not resolve.
*   If the Special Summon of “Sillva, Warlord of Dark World” is negated with “Royal Oppression”, the second part of his effect does not resolve.
*   If “Sillva, Warlord of Dark World” is discarded by your opponent’s card effect, when his effect resolves, he is Special Summoned first, and then the second part of his effect resolves. So the opponent cannot activate “Bottomless Trap Hole” or “Torrential Tribute”; the timing is no longer correct. Also, you could not draw a card for the effect of “Card of Safe Return”.

  
## SILVER WING

*   If a monster equipped with “Silver Wing” is equipped with “Blast Sphere” and would be destroyed during the Standby Phase, both “Blast Sphere” and “Silver Wing” are destroyed but the monster is not and no damage is inflicted.
*   If “Silver Wing” and the monster it is equipped to would be destroyed by a card effect simultaneously, you cannot use the effect of “Silver Wing.”
*   Multiple copies of “Silver Wing” are not accumulative.
*   Equipping two copies of “Silver Wing” to a single monster protects the monster from being destroyed by battle twice per turn, not four times.

  
## SIMORGH, BIRD OF ANCESTRY

*   Level 5-6 WIND monsters are Normal Summoned without Tributing while "Simorgh, Bird of Ancestry" is face-up. They are not treated as being Tribute Summoned.
*   If you control 2 or more face-up "Simorgh, Bird of Ancestry", the number of Tributes required to Tribute Summon WIND monsters is still only reduced by 1.
*   You can Tribute 1 face-up "Simorgh, Bird of Ancestry" to Tribute Summon a Level 7 or higher WIND monster.
*   When you draw "Simorgh, Bird of Ancestry" during your Draw Phase, you can reveal it to activate "Heart of the Underdog"'s effect.
*   "Simorgh, Bird of Ancestry"'s effect targets 1 or 2 of your opponent's cards to return to the owner's hand.

  
## SINISTER SEEDS

*   "Sinister Seeds" can be activated when the monster destroyed by battle is sent to the Graveyard.
*   "Sinister Seeds" cannot be activated if you will not have enough open Monster Card Zones for every Sinister Seed Token that would be Special Summoned. You cannot activate "Sinister Seeds" when you receive 3000 or more battle damage.
*   You cannot activate "Sinister Seeds" if you do not receive at least 500 points of Battle Damage.

  
## SINISTER SERPENT

*   The effect of this card is optional; you do not have to return it to your hand.
*   The effect of this card activates no matter how it is sent to the Graveyard. It can be destroyed, Tributed, discarded from the hand, or sent straight from the Deck to the Graveyard.
*   If your "Sinister Serpent" is on the field and is destroyed during your Standby Phase, you may return it to your hand during that same Standby Phase.
*   If "Sinister Serpent" is destroyed as a result of battle with "Dark Ruler Ha Des" or "Dark Balter the Terrible" you cannot activate its effect and return it to your hand during your next Standby Phase, or any subsequent Standby Phase.
*   You cannot activate the effect of "Sinister Serpent" if "The End of Anubis" is on the field.
*   "Necrovalley" does not negate the effect of "Sinister Serpent".

  
## SINISTER SPROCKET

*   When "Sinister Sprocket" is used as a Synchro Material Monster, if the Synchro Monster becomes a DARK monster when it is Synchro Summoned (due to "DNA Transplant", etc.), you can activate "Sinister Sprocket"'s effect.

  
## SIX SAMURAI UNITED

*   Placing a Bushido Counter onto "Six Samurai United" does not start a Chain.
*   Sending "Six Samurai United" to the Graveyard is a cost to activate its effect.
*   When your opponent Normal or Special Summons a "Six Samurai" monster, place a Bushido Counter onto "Six Samurai United".

  
## SKILL DRAIN  
> Pay 1000 Life Points. ① The effects of all face-up Effect Monsters are negated.

*   The ① Continuous-like Effect does not activate.
    *   Paying 1000 Life Points is a cost.
    *   Face-up Effect Monsters may still activate their effects and pay costs.
    *   Negate all effects of face-up Effect Monsters that activate / apply as long as that monster is face-up. This includes Unclassified Effects that apply on the field (like "Tuningware").
    *   If an Effect Monster is not face-up on the field when its effect resolves, the effect is not negated.
    *   Maintenance costs (ex: "Armor Exe") must still be paid.
    *   Conditions (which are not effects) and Lingering Effects are not negated.
    *   Spell Counters cannot be held by Monsters (ex: "Skilled Dark Magician"), remove all Spell Counters.
*   VS. "Jinzo": Whichever card was face-up first applies its effect.

  
## SKILL SUCCESSOR  
> ① Select 1 face-up monster you control. It gains 400 ATK until the End Phase. ② You can remove from play this card in the Graveyard to give 1 face-up monster you control 800 ATK until the End Phase. This effect cannot be activated the turn this card is sent to the Graveyard, and can only be activated during your turn.

*   The ① effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect targest 1 face-up monster you control.
    *   This card can be activated in the Damage Step before Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.
*   The ② Quick-like Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   Removing “Skill Successor” from play is a cost.
    *   This effect targets 1 face-up monster you control.
    *   This effect can be activated in the Damage Step before Substep 4 - Damage Calculation.

  
## SKILLED DARK MAGICIAN

*   You place a Spell Counter on this card when the Spell Card resolves, so if "Magic Jammer" is used to negate the Spell Card's activation then you do not place a Spell Counter on this monster. But if "Imperial Order" is chained to the Spell Card, you still place a Spell Counter on this monster because the activation of the Spell Card was not negated. If the Spell Card was a Continuous, Equip, or Field Spell Card, and “Dust Tornado” is chained to its activation and destroys it before it resolves you still place a Spell Counter because the activation of the card was not negated.
*   If you activate a Spell Card, and your opponent chains "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Skilled Dark Magician, "Skilled Dark Magician" does not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card because "Skilled Dark Magician" must be face-up on the field when the Spell Card is activated and when it resolves in order to get a Spell Counter.
*   You place a Spell Counter for any Spell Card that is activated, including Equip Spell, Field Spell, etc.
*   When you use the effect of a Continuous Spell Card that is already face-up on the field, such as "Inspection", or sending "Wave-Motion Cannon" to the Graveyard, or paying for "Messenger of Peace", you do NOT place a Spell Counter on this monster.
*   When "Double Spell" is played, you get a Spell Counter on this monster for the activation of "Double Spell", but not for the target of "Double Spell" because the target is never activated; so you get 1 Spell Counter on this monster.
*   You do not place a Spell Counter on this monster when you attach or detach a Union Monster because that is not the activation of a Spell Card.
*   If you activate "Monster Reborn" or "Premature Burial" to revive this monster, this monster does not get a Spell Counter for "Monster Reborn" (it has to be face-up on the field before the activation of the Spell Card).
*   You can only Tribute this monster for its effect during Main Phase 1 or 2 of your turn.
*   This monster's effect does NOT target and you select the monster when you resolve the effect, so if you Tribute it to Special Summon "Dark Magician" from your Graveyard and your opponent chains "Disappear" and removes that "Dark Magician", you can Special Summon a different "Dark Magician" from your hand/Deck/Graveyard instead.
*   If there are no "Dark Magician" in your hand, Deck, and Graveyard, you cannot activate "Skilled Dark Magician"'s effect to Special Summon a "Dark Magician".
*   When "Skill Drain" is active, and you or your opponent activates a Spell Card, do not place Spell Counters on this monster. Any Spell Counters that are on this monster are removed when "Skill Drain" is activated.
*   If a player controls the opponent's "Skilled Dark Magician" and Tribute it with 3 Spell Counters, the player who controlled and Tributed the "Skilled Dark Magician" is the player who Special Summons "Dark Magician" from the hand, Deck, or Graveyard.

  
## SKILLED WHITE MAGICIAN

*   You place a Spell Counter on this card when the Spell Card resolves, so if "Magic Jammer" is used to negate the Spell Card's activation then you do not place a Spell Counter on this monster. But if "Imperial Order" is chained to the Spell Card, you still place a Spell Counter on this monster because the activation of the Spell Card was not negated. If the Spell Card was a Continuous, Equip, or Field Spell Card, and “Dust Tornado” is chained to its activation and destroys it before it resolves you still place a Spell Counter because the activation of the card was not negated.
*   If you activate a Spell Card, and your opponent chains "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Skilled White Magician", "Skilled White Magician" does not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card because "Skilled White Magician" must be face-up on the field when the Spell Card is activated and when it resolves in order to get a Spell Counter.
*   You place a Spell Counter for any Spell Card that is activated, including Equip Spell, Field Spell, etc.
*   When you use the effect of a Continuous Spell Card that is already face-up on the field, such as "Inspection", or sending "Wave-Motion Cannon" to the Graveyard, or paying for "Messenger of Peace", you do NOT place a Spell Counter on this monster.
*   When "Double Spell" is played, you get a Spell Counter on this monster for the activation of "Double Spell", but not for the target of "Double Spell" because the target is never activated; so you get 1 Spell Counter on this monster.
*   You do not place a Spell Counter on this monster when you attach or detach a Union Monster because that is not the activation of a Spell Card.
*   If you activate "Monster Reborn" or "Premature Burial" to revive this monster, this monster does not get a Spell Counter for "Monster Reborn" (it has to be face-up on the field before the activation of the Spell Card).
*   You can only Tribute this monster for its effect during Main Phase 1 or 2 of your turn.
*   This monster's effect does NOT target and you select the monster when you resolve the effect, so if you Tribute it to Special Summon "Buster Blader" from your Graveyard and your opponent chains "Disappear" and removes that "Buster Blader", you can Special Summon a different "Buster Blader" from your hand/Deck/Graveyard instead.
*   If there are no "Buster Blader" in your hand, Deck, and Graveyard, you cannot activate "Skilled White Magician"'s effect that Special Summons "Buster Blader".
*   When "Skill Drain" is active, and you or your opponent activates a Spell Card, do not place Spell Counters on this monster. Any Spell Counters that are on this monster are removed when "Skill Drain" is activated.
*   If a player controls the opponent's "Skilled White Magician" and Tribute it with 3 Spell Counters, the player who controlled and Tributed the "Skilled White Magician" is the player who Special Summons "Buster Blader" from the hand, Deck, or Graveyard.

  
## SKREECH

*   “Skreech's” effect activates at the end of Damage Step, when monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the Graveyard, but "Skreech" does not have to be "sent to the Graveyard". "Skreech"'s effect activates in its owner's Graveyard (or Removed Zone, etc.)
*   If you take control of your opponent's "Skreech", and it is destroyed as a result of battle, then your opponent (the original owner) will activate its effect.

  
## SKULL CONDUCTOR

*   You cannot activate the effect if you have no monsters to Special Summon.
*   You cannot Special Summon “King of the Skull Servants” or other monsters with ? ATK using this effect.
*   The effect to destroy “Skull Conductor” also activates during your opponent’s Battle Phase.
*   If “Skull Conductor” is face-down it won’t be destroyed at the end of the Battle Phase.
*   You can Special Summon one monster with 2000 ATK or one monster with 2000 ATK and one monster with 0 ATK if you want.
*   You look at the printed ATK of the monsters you want to Special Summon.

  
## SKULL INVITATION

*   Cards that are Tributed or Discarded are included, because they are also "sent to the Graveyard".
*   The effects of multiple "Skull Invitation" are cumulative.
*   If "Dark Hole" destroys monsters controlled by both players, the damage from "Skull Invitation" is applied to both players simultaneously.
*   If you draw the final piece of "Exodia" with "Graceful Charity" and have all 5 pieces of "Exodia" in your hand after discarding, you win the Duel even if the damage resulting from "Skull Invitation" would reduce your Life Points to 0.

  
## SKULL KNIGHT #2

*   If you Tribute Set a high level Fiend-Type monster by Tributing this card, you CAN Special Summon another "Skull Knight #2" from your Deck and you do NOT have to reveal your Set monster to prove it is a Fiend-Type.
*   If you activate "Change of Heart" to control your opponent’s "Skull Knight #2" and Tribute it to Tribute Summon a Fiend-Type monster you can Special Summon a "Skull Knight #2" from your Deck. But if you activate "Soul Exchange" to Tribute a "Skull Knight #2" on your opponent’s side of the field, neither player can activate its effect.
*   If this card is used as a Tribute for a Special Summon, such as a Ritual Summon, the effect of this card is not activated.
*   If the Tribute Summon of a Fiend-Type monster is negated by "Solemn Judgment" or "Horn of Heaven", the effect of "Skull Knight #2" will not activate.
*   If the opponent chains "Torrential Tribute" to the effect of "Skull Knight #2", all monsters will be destroyed (including the Level 5 or higher Fiend-Type monster that was Tribute Summoned) and then "Skull Knight #2" will be Special Summoned from your Deck. If the opponent waits until the effect of "Skull Knight #2" resolves and another copy is Special Summoned, and then activates "Torrential Tribute" in response to that Summon, all the monsters will be destroyed.

  
## SKULL LAIR

*   Removing Monster Cards in your Graveyard from play is a cost to activate "Skull Lair"'s Ignition-like effect.
*   You cannot destroy a face-down monster because its Level cannot be determined.

  
## SKULL ZOMA

*   When "Skull Zoma" is destroyed by battle, its effect activates when it is sent to the Graveyard at the end of the Damage Step. This effect still activates if it is removed from play instead, due to "Macro Cosmos", etc. This effect starts a Chain.
*   When "Dark Ruler Ha Des" destroys "Skull Zoma" by battle, its effects are negated and it will not inflict damage.
*   When "Skull Zoma" is destroyed by battle, its owner activates its effect.
*   If a "Skull Zoma" is Special Summoned with "Magical Hats", its effect will not activate when it is destroyed in battle.

*   "Skull Zoma"'s effect cannot be negated by "Skill Drain".
*   "Des Volstgalph"'s effect does not activate when it destroys "Skull Zoma" by battle.
*   If "Skull Zoma" inflicts damage to your opponent's Life Points while "Begone, Knave!" is active, it will return to your hand. If "Makyura the Destructor"'s effect was activated during the same turn, it can be activated from the hand and Special Summoned. If "Final Attack Orders" is also active, it will be shifted into Attack Position and can then attack again during the same Battle Phase.
*   "Skull Zoma" inflicts damage equal to the current ATK of the monster that destroyed it by battle.
*   When "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" destroys "Skull Zoma" by battle, it can activate its effect to attack once again.
*   When "Skull Zoma" is equipped to "Relinquished" by its effect, it is only treated as an Equip Spell Card, not a Trap Card or Monster Card.
*   While "Skull Zoma" is treated as an Effect Monster Card, it can be targeted with "Generation Shift" or "Next to Be Lost".

## SLIP OF FORTUNE

*   If the monster being attacked is removed from the field by an effect Chained to “Slip of Fortune” the attack will still be negated.
*   If the monster being attacked is in face-down Defense Position, “Slip of Fortune” will remove it from play face-down and return it to play in face-down Defense Position.

*   If the opponent chains "Dust Tornado" or "Mystical Space Typhoon" to the activation of "Smoke Grenade of the Thief", it is destroyed and its effect is NOT activated. This is because it is an Equip Spell Card, and must be on the field when it resolves for its effect to activate.

## SOLITAIRE MAGICIAN

*   This effect targets 2 monsters.
*   You reduce the Level of the targeted "[Fortune Lady](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fortune_Lady)" monster when the effect resolves.
*   If you increase the Level of your "[Fortune Lady](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fortune_Lady)" monster with "[Time Passage](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Time_Passage)" and then reduce it for the effect of "[Solitaire Magician](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Solitaire_Magician)", your "[Fortune Lady](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fortune_Lady)" will still have its Level reduced by 3 when the effect of "[Time Passage](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Time_Passage)" is no longer applied.
*   You cannot choose to reduce the Level of a "[Fortune Lady](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fortune_Lady)" monster whose Level is less than 3.
*   If you activate this effect and the targeted "[Fortune Lady](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fortune_Lady)" monster is flipped face-down by "[Book of Moon](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Book_of_Moon)", the effect of "[Solitaire Magician](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Solitaire_Magician)" will not apply. If the monster [targeted](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Target) to be destroyed is flipped face-down by "[Book of Moon](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Book_of_Moon)", the effect of "[Solitaire Magician](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Solitaire_Magician)" resolves normally.

## SONIC JAMMER

*   If you activate "Sonic Jammer" during your turn, it lasts until the end of your opponent's End Phase. If you activate "Sonic Jammer" during your opponent's turn, it lasts until the end of your End Phase.
*   If "Skill Drain" is activated after "Sonic Jammer"'s effect has resolved, the effect of "Sonic Jammer" is not negated because "Skill Drain" was not active when "Sonic Jammer" was flipped, activated its effect, and applied its effect.
*   While "Sonic Jammer"'s effect is applied, your opponent can still use the effects of "Wave Motion Cannon", or "Black Pendant" when sent to the Graveyard, or Field Spell Cards like "Fusion Gate".
*   While "Sonic Jammer"'s effect is applied, your opponent cannot activate "Spiritualism".

  
## SOUL ABSORPTION

*   "Soul Absorption"'s effect is based on the number of cards, not on each "lump sum" of cards. So if 3 DARK monsters are removed from the Graveyard to Special Summon "Dark Necrofear", the controller of "Soul Absorption" gains 1500 Life Points.
*   However, you receive the Life Points from "Soul Absorption" as a "lump sum", so in the case of "Dark Necrofear" you gain 1500 Life Points but your "Fire Princess" would only do 500 points of damage.
*   "Soul Absorption" is a "trigger-like" Continuous Spell Card, not a "continuous-like" Continuous Spell Card, so activate its effect after the current chain resolves that includes removing cards from play.
*   The effect of "Soul Absorption" can, itself, be chained to after it activates.
*   If "Soul Absorption"'s effect activates in response to the Special Summon of a monster like "Dark Necrofear" or "Inferno", Soul Absorption's effect activates after the monster is Special Summoned.
*   For "Chaosrider Gustapth", activate "Soul Absorption"'s effect after "Chaosrider Gustaph"'s effect resolves.
*   Your "Soul Absorption"'s effect activates even when your opponent's cards are removed.

  
## SOUL DEMOLITION

*   If either player has no monsters in their Graveyard, the effect of this card cannot be activated.
*   If "Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer" is on the field, the effect of this card cannot be activated.
*   Paying 500 Life Points is a cost.
*   You must select the monster in the Graveyard you wish to target when you activate this card’s effect. You select before the opponent does. After you select the opponent may chain, with a card like "Dust Tornado", to destroy "Soul Demolition". In this case its effect will not resolve and no monsters will be removed. This is because it is a Continuous Trap Card and it must remain on the field for its effect to resolve. If the effect is negated you do not get a refund of the 500 Life Point cost.
*   If the opponent chains to the effect of "Soul Demolition" with an effect that destroys all the Fiend-Type monsters on your side of the field, the effect of "Soul Demolition" resolves because the activation conditions were correct at the time.
*   If you chain the effect of "Soul Demolition" to "Monster Reborn" and remove the monster targeted by "Monster Reborn" from play, the effect of "Monster Reborn" disappears.

  
## SOUL DEVOURING BAMBOO SWORD

*   “Soul Devouring Bamboo Sword” targets the selected monster that is equipped with “Bamboo Sword”.
*   The effect of “Soul Devouring Bamboo Sword” that causes the opponent to skip their next Draw Phase activates at the time the selected monster inflicts Battle Damage. This effect begins a Chain.
*   If a “Bamboo Sword” equip card is no longer equipped to the selected monster, the effect of “Soul Devouring Bamboo Sword” no longer activates when the selected monster inflicts Battle Damage. The effect that destroys “Soul Devouring Bamboo Sword” during the second Standby Phase after activation is still applied.
*   The effect that destroys “Soul Devouring Bamboo Sword” during the second Standby Phase after it was activated does not begin a Chain.

    *   Face-down monsters cannot be Tributed for a Ritual Summon or “Metamorphosis” because you do not know their Level, nor for "Deck Devastation Virus" or "Icarus Attack".
    *   You do not gain control of the target, so you can use “Soul Exchange” combined with your “Cannon Soldier’s” effect even if you already have 5 monsters in your Monster Card Zone.
    *   Tributing the opponent's monster is optional (_"This turn you can Tribute that monster"_).
    *   You can Tribute the target for a Tribute Summon, for a Ritual Summon, or as a cost / effect.
    *   You can play 2 “Soul Exchanges” and then Tribute both targets to Summon a Level 7+ monster.
    *   You cannot Tribute the monster targeted by "Soul Exchange" to pay the cost to activate the effect of your "Exiled Force", because "Exiled Force" must Tribute itself.
    *   You can Tribute the opponent's face-up Plant-Type monster for "Lonefire Blossom"'s effect.
    *   If the ACTIVATION of "Soul Exchange" is negated (by "Dark Bribe"), the Ⓒ Condition is not applied. You can conduct your Battle Phase this turn.
    *   If the EFFECT of "Soul Exchange" is negated (by "Imperial Order"), the Ⓒ Condition still applies. You cannot conduct your Battle Phase this turn.
*   You cannot activate “Soul Exchange” during your Main Phase 2 because you must skip your Battle Phase.
*   You cannot use “Soul Exchange” for “Polymerization” because “Polymerization” does not use Tribute.

## SOUL-ABSORBING BONE TOWER

*   If you have a "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" equipped with "Raregold Armor" and a Zombie-Type monster, your opponent cannot attack. Even if you have a Zombie-Type monster, "Gemini Elf", and a "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" equipped with "Raregold Armor", your opponent cannot attack.
*   If you have another Zombie-Type monster and "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower", your opponent cannot attack the "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower", but if you equip the "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" with "Ring of Magnetism" your opponent can declare an attack but must attack the "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" equipped with the "Ring of Magnetism".
*   If you have multiple "Soul-Absorbing Bone Towers" and no other monsters, your opponent cannot attack.
*   When your opponent attacks your "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" and during the Battle Step you activate "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon another Zombie-Type monster, then a replay occurs (and you send 2 cards from your opponent's Deck to the Graveyard).
*   If "DNA Surgery" is in play changing all monsters to Zombie-Types, and a monster that was not originally a Zombie-Type is Special Summoned, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect is applied and you send 2 cards from your opponent's Deck to the Graveyard.
*   If a Zombie-Type monster is Special Summoned on your opponent's side of the field, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect activates.
*   If a Zombie-Type monster is Special Summoned face-down (with "The Shallow Grave", etc.) then "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect does not activate.
*   If multiple Zombie-Type monsters are Special Summoned simultaneously, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect is only applied once (so send just 2 cards).
*   If "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" is Special Summoned by itself, its effect is not applied for its own Special Summon.
*   If "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" and several other Zombie-Type monsters are Special Summoned simultaneously (with "Cyber Jar"), that Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower's effect is not applied.
*   If you have "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" in play and "The Kick Man" is Special Summoned, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect is Step 1 of a chain and "The Kick Man"'s effect is Step 2.
*   If you have "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" and "Card of Safe Return", and a Zombie-Type monster is Special Summoned, "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" is Step 1 of the chain and "Card of Safe Return" is Step 2.
*   You can chain to "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower"'s effect that sends 2 cards to the Graveyard.

  
## SPACE GIFT

*   Count the number of "Neo-Spacian" monsters you control with different names when "Space Gift" resolves.
*   If you control a "Neo-Spacian Marine Dolphin" when "Space Gift" resolves, you will draw 2 cards for it because its name is also treated as "Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin".

  
## SPACEGATE

*   Placing a "Gate Counter" onto "Spacegate" does not start a Chain.
*   Sending "Spacegate" to the Graveyard is a cost to activate its second effect.
*   If "Royal Decree" is chained to the second effect of "Spacegate", "Spacegate"'s effect is negated because the effect activated on the field.

  
## SPARK BLASTER

*   “Spark Blaster” targets.
*   You can activate the effect of “Spark Blaster” multiple times in the same Main Phase. You can activate the effect of “Spark Blaster” during the same turn you played it from your hand.
*   You can chain to “Spark Blaster” when its effect is used. After its effect is used 3 times, you cannot chain to the destruction of “Spark Blaster”.
*   If “Silent Swordsman LV7” is on the field when “Spark Blaster’s” effect is used for the third time, “Spark Blaster” is still destroyed normally.
*   If you chain to the effect of “Spark Blaster” with “Emergency Provisions” and send “Spark Blaster” to your Graveyard, because “Spark Blaster” is no longer on the field its effect disappears.

  
## SPATIAL COLLAPSE

*   If "Spatial Collapse" is activated, and an effect is chained so that a player has more than 5 cards on the field after "Spatial Collapse" resolves, the controller selects cards to send to the Graveyard to make the number 5.
*   You can activate "Spatial Collapse" when you have 5 or less cards on the field and your opponent has 5 or less cards on the field.
*   "Spatial Collapse" includes Tokens, too.
*   While "Spatial Collapse" is active and you have 1 or more cards already on your side of the field, you cannot activate "Scapegoat" because you would have your 1 previous card + the "Scapegoat" card + 4 monster tokens = 6.
*   When you have 4 cards on your side of the field while "Spatial Collapse" is active, you cannot activate "Change of Heart".
*   When "Cyber Jar" is activated while "Spatial Collapse" is active, if the number of cards exceeds 5, each player selects cards to send to the Graveyard to make the number 5.
*   When you have 4 cards on the field and you activate "Remove Brainwashing", you select cards to destroy to make the number of cards you control 5.

  
## SPEAR CRETIN

*   If you can Special Summon a monster but your opponent cannot, you will still Special Summon. If your opponent can Special Summon a monster and you cannot, your opponent will still Special Summon.
*   Special Summoning a monster is optional.
*   "Spear Cretin" cannot Special Summon itself from the Graveyard, but it can Special Summon another copy of "Spear Cretin".
*   After "Spear Cretin" is flipped face-up, if it and another monster you control are destroyed by the same effect, you can Special Summon the other destroyed monster.

  
## SPEAR DRAGON

*   If "Spear Dragon" attacks, even if the damage is reduced to 0 by the effect of "Waboku" or "Kuriboh", it is still changed to Defense Position.
*   "Spear Dragon" will change to Defense Position after it attacks, regardless of the battle position of the opponent’s monster.
*   The effect of "Spear Dragon" does not prevent you from manually changing its battle position later on. Of course, you cannot change it in the same turn after you attacked with "Spear Dragon". But during your next turn you can change it back to Attack Position (and attack again the same turn, if you choose).
*   If you attack your opponent’s Defense Position monster with 0 DEF with your "Spear Dragon", and have "Dragon’s Rage" active on the field, the opponent only takes 1900 points of damage. The effects are not cumulative.
*   The effect of "Lord of D." will not prevent the effect of "Spear Dragon" from changing it to Defense Position after it attacks.

  
## SPECIAL HURRICANE

*   "Special Hurricane" will destroy face-down monsters that were Special Summoned.
*   If a monster is Special Summoned, then removed from the field with "Interdimensional Matter Transporter", and returns to the field, "Special Hurricane" WILL destroy it if activated after it returns to the field.

  
## SPELL ABSORPTION

*   The effect of “Spell Absorption” is applied when the Spell Card is activated. You cannot chain to this effect. The effect is applied immediately. For example, when activating “Tribute to the Doomed” while “Spell Absorption” is on the field: ① pay the cost by discarding a card, ② activate “Tribute to the Doomed”, ③ your Life Points increase for “Spell Absorption”, ④ check for chaining and resolve “Tribute to the Doomed”.
*   If the activation of a Spell Card is negated by “Magic Jammer”, etc., then you will not gain Life Points for “Spell Absorption”.
*   A Spell Card used from the Graveyard by the effect of “Double Spell” is not considered “activated”, so you will only gain Life Points for “Spell Absorption” for “Double Spell” itself, not for the card used from the Graveyard.
*   When you activate “Spell Absorption”, you do not gain Life Points for activating “Spell Absorption” itself.

  
## SPELL CANCELLER  
> ① As long as this card remains face-up on the field, Spell Cards cannot be activated. ② The effects of all Spell Cards are also negated.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies on the field.
    *   Players CANNOT activate(play face-up) Spell Card. This does not "_negate the activation_" of Spell Cards (the way "Dark Bribe" does), and so "Spiritualism" cannot be played.
    *   Player CAN activate the effects of Spell Cards on the field and in the Graveyard.
    *   Lingering Effects that have already been established (ex: "Limited Removal") are not affected.
*   The ② Continuous Effect applies on the field.

    *   VS. "Premature Burial": "Spell Canceller" is not destroyed by the effect of "Premature Burial".

  
## SPELL CHRONICLE

*   "Spell Chronicle" cannot be activated when you have a combined total of 4 or less Spell and Trap Cards remaining in your Deck.
*   The Spell and Trap Cards are removed from play face-up.
*   Placing 1 Chronicle Counter onto "Spell Chronicle" does not start a Chain.
*   The damage inflicted by "Spell Chronicle" does not start a Chain.
*   Adding 1 of the removed from play Spell or Trap Cards to your hand does not target the card to be added to your hand.
*   When you activate "Spell Chronicle", it does not gain a Chronicle Counter if a Quick-Play Spell Card is chained to its activation.

  
## SPELL ECONOMICS

*   While "Spell Economics" is active, you don't have to pay Life Points to activate a Spell Card (place it face-up on the field), but to activate an effect of a Spell Card, like "Archfiend's Oath", you still have to pay.
*   Only the controller of "Spell Economics" gets its effect.
*   You have to pay for "Chain Energy" even if you control "Spell Economics".
*   You pay the 500 Life Points to restore "Horn of Light" to your Deck even if "Spell Economics" is on the field.

  
## SPELL GEAR

*   "'Ancient Gear' cards" means any card you control that has "Ancient Gear" in its card name.
*   You cannot activate "Spell Gear" if you do not have any "Ancient Gear Golem" remaining in your Deck.
*   If an effect is chained that prevents you from Special Summoning "Ancient Gear Golem", you still cannot Normal Summon or Set until the end of your next turn.
*   The effect that prohibits Normal Summons or Sets until the end of your next turn is not a restriction on this card’s activation. So you can activate this card if you Normal Summoned earlier in the turn. But you cannot Normal Summon or Set after it is activated.

  
## SPELL OF PAIN

*   “Spell of Pain” ‘switches’ damage, like “Barrel Behind the Door.” It does not actually have an effect itself that ‘inflicts’ damage. “Spell of Pain” is chained to an effect that would inflict damage to you.
*   You cannot activate “Spell of Pain” during the Damage Step.

  
## SPELL REACTOR RE

*   This effect does not negate the Spell Card’s effect; it merely destroys the Spell Card.
*   This is a Trigger Effect that activates by chaining it to the activation of the Spell Card. It does not target.
*   This effect can be activated during the Damage Step.
*   If the Spell Card cannot be destroyed when this effect resolves (example: it was destroyed by another card effect already), then you do not inflict 800 damage to your opponent.

  
## SPELL RECLAMATION

*   This effect does not target.
*   This card can be chained to any type of Spell Card (Normal, Continuous, Quick-Play or Equip or Field.).
*   This card’s effect to return the Spell Card to its owner’s hand does not start a Chain.
*   This card’s effect is only applied once, the first time the Spell Card it was chained to is sent from the field to the Graveyard for any reason. This includes an Equip Spell Card equipped to a monster Tributed for a Tribute Summon, or a card sent to the Graveyard as a cost for "Emergency Provisions", etc.
*   The Spell Card must be sent to the Graveyard, if it is removed from play, it will not return to your hand.
*   If the Spell Card that “Spell Reclamation” was chained to is removed from play, or returned to the hand, etc. instead of going to the Graveyard, “Spell Reclamation’s” effect is no longer applied.
*   If the Spell Card that "Spell Reclamation" affected is sent to the Graveyard during resolution of a Chain, it returns to the owner's hand immediately after resolving the effect that sent it to the Graveyard.
*   This card can only be chained to the activation a Spell Card, and not when the effect of a Spell Card is activated (by "Destiny Hero - Diamond Dude", etc.)
*   If "Spell Reclamation" is chained to a Spell Card's activation, and "Mystical Space Typhoon", etc. is chained to "Spell Reclamation" targeting the same Spell Card, that Spell Card will not return to its owner's hand because it is destroyed before "Spell Reclamation" resolves.
*   If a Spell Card that has an effect that activates when it is sent to the Graveyard, like "Black Pendant" or "Lucky Iron Axe", is affected by "Spell Reclamation", that Spell Card's effect will activate, and it will be returned to its owner's hand before resolving the effect.

## SPELLBINDING CIRCLE

*   The Battle Position of a monster targeted by this card can still be changed by card effects, such as "Book of Moon", "Stop Defense", etc.
*   This card may select a face-down monster as a target. This prevents the monster from being Flip Summoned, but it will still be flipped face-up if it is the target of an attack.
*   If the targeted monster is Tributed, changed into an Equip Spell Card by the effect of "Relinquished", returned to the owner’s hand, or otherwise removed from the field without being destroyed, "Spellbinding Circle" remains on the field meaninglessly.
*   You can chain "Spellbinding Circle" to the activation of a Flip Effect when a monster is Flip Summoned or flipped face-up, but it will not negate the activation or resolution of the Flip Effect.
*   You can activate "Change of Heart" and take control of a monster targeted by "Spellbinding Circle" but you cannot attack with it or change its Battle Position.
*   If a monster attacks and you activate "Spellbinding Circle", the monster’s attack stops.

## SPIDER’S LAIR

*   This effect targets 1 face-up Insect-Type monster you control. It is targeted continuously.
*   You can activate this effect targeting your Insect-Type monster during your Main Phase. It starts a Chain.
*   The effect to change your opponent’s monster to Defense Position is applied after damage calculation.

*   If a monster being kept in Defense Position by “Spider’s Lair” is flipped face-down with “Book of Moon,” the effect of “Spider’s Lair” is no longer applied to it.
*   If a monster you targeted with “Spider’s Lair” is flipped face-down, it is no longer targeted by “Spider’s Lair.”
*   If your opponent’s monster is not changed to Defense Position by “Spider’s Lair” then the effect to keep it in Defense Position is not applied.
*   Changing your opponent’s monster to Defense Position does not start a Chain.

  
## SPIDER EGG

*   This card does not target.
*   If you do not have enough open Monster Card Zones to Special Summon the “Spider Tokens” in, you cannot activate “Spider Egg.”
*   If you do not have enough Monster Card Zones when “Spider Egg” resolves, the attack is not negated and no “Spider Tokens” are Summoned.

  
## SPIDER WEB

## SPIRAL SPEAR STRIKE

*   If you have 2 copies of “Spiral Spear Strike”, or “Spiral Spear Strike” and a “Gaia the Dragon Champion” equipped with “Fairy Meteor Crush”, the damage to your opponent’s Life Points is not doubled. (In the case of “Fairy Meteor Crush”, you still can draw for the “Spiral Spear Strike” effect.)

  
## SPIRIT BARRIER

*   You still perform damage calculation with "Spirit Barrier" even though the damage to the controller’s Life Points becomes zero.
*   If you have 1 monster on the field, and "Airknight Parshath" attack and destroys it, and would do extra damage, there is still a monster on the field when "Airknight Parshath"’s effect would activate and resolve, so "Spirit Barrier"’s effect is applied, "Airknight Parshath" inflicts zero damage to your Life Points, and your opponent does not draw 1 card for "Airknight Parshath"’s effect.

  
## SPIRIT BURNER

*   Each effect of this card starts a Chain.

  
## SPIRIT ELIMINATION

*   During the turn that "Spirit Elimination" is activated; all monsters removed from play must be from your side of the field. This means that you cannot activated "Soul Release" and remove two monsters from your side of the field and three from your Graveyard.
*   Any conditions set on the Monster Cards that would be removed from the Graveyard must still be fulfilled on the Monsters removed from your side of the field. For example, to Special Summon "Dark Necrofear" you must remove 3 Fiend-Type Monsters from your side of the field.
*   You can activate "Spirit Elimination" while "Necrovalley" is active.

  
## SPIRIT FORCE

*   You can activate “Spirit Force” to prevent damage, even if you don’t have a Warrior Tuner to return to your hand.

## SPIRIT OF THE PHARAOH

*   "Spirit of the Pharaoh" cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, and cannot be Special Summoned EXCEPT by the effect of "The First Sarcophagus". So "Spirit of the Pharaoh" cannot be Special Summoned with "Monster Reborn", etc., even if Special Summoned properly first.
*   If your opponent chains "Royal Decree" to the effect of "The First Sarcophagus", the effect of Special Summoning is negated and "The First Sarcophagus" is sent to the Graveyard because that is the cost.

## SPIRIT OF THE POT OF GREED

*   "Spirit of the Pot of Greed"'s effect does not chain to "Pot of Greed"; instead, you activate it after "Pot of Greed" resolves.
*   "Spirit of the Pot of Greed" must be face-up on the field to resolve its effect; if "Book of Moon" is chained to "Pot of Greed" or to the effect of "Spirit of the Pot of Greed", "Spirit of the Pot of Greed"'s effect is negated.
*   If "Imperial Order" negates the effect of "Pot of Greed", "Spirit of the Pot of Greed"'s effect still activates because "Pot of Greed"'s activation was not negated.

  
## SPIRIT OF THE SIX SAMURAI  
> ① Once per turn, you can equip this card to a "Six Samurai" monster you control, OR unequip it to Special Summon this card in face-up Attack Position. ② When equipped to a monster by this card's effect, that monster gains 500 ATK and DEF. ③ When the equipped monster destroys an opponent's monster by battle, draw 1 card.

## SPIRITUAL ENERGY SETTLE MACHINE

*   When this card is active, Spirit Monsters on both sides of the field do not return to their owner’s hand during the End Phase of the turn they were Summoned.
*   Discarding 1 card during your End Phase is a maintenance cost and must be paid each turn. You may decide to not discard a card, and destroy this card instead.

## SPLENDID VENUS

*   If "Jinzo" and "Splendid Venus" are face-up on the field, Trap Cards and the effects of Trap Cards still cannot be activated because "Jinzo" prevents Trap Cards and Trap Card effects from being activated. The Continuous Effects of Trap Cards controlled by the player with "Splendid Venus" are not negated.

  
## SPRING OF REBIRTH

*   Only the controller of "Spring of Rebirth" gains Life Points by its effect. If you control "Spring of Rebirth", you gain Life Points even when a monster is returned to your opponent’s hand.
*   You gain 500 Life Points each time a monster or monsters on the field are returned to their owner’s hand. So if "Penguin Soldier" returns two monsters at once, you only gain 500 Life Points.

## SPYDER SPIDER

(Remember that Spell and Trap Cards remain on the field until the entire chain resolves, unless destroyed by a card effect during the chain.)
*   If your opponent destroys all the Dragon-Type monsters on your side of the field as a chain to the activation of this card, this card will still resolve since the conditions were met at the time of activation.

  
## STAR BLAST

*   “Star Blast” does not target.
*   When its effect resolves, choose a monster on the field or in your hand.
*   Paying Life Points is a cost. “Star Blast” cannot be activated while “Spell Economics” is on the field, since you cannot pay costs.
*   If you use “Star Blast” on a monster in your hand and then Set that monster, its Level is still reduced and will be reduced when it is flipped face-up.
*   You cannot use “Star Blast” on a face-down monster you control on the field. If a monster affected by “Star Blast” is face-up on the field, and is then flipped face-down (with “Book of Moon”, etc.) then the effect of “Star Blast” is wiped and the monster’s Level returns to normal.
*   If you activate “Star Blast” but have no monsters to use it on when its effect resolves, your opponent can look at your hand to confirm that you have no monsters in your hand.
*   You cannot reduce a monster’s Level below 1 and you cannot over-pay for “Star Blast”.
*   You cannot select a Level 1 monster for “Star Blast”.
*   If you paid 1000 Life Points, you cannot select a Level 2 monster, etc.

*   If “Majestic Mech – Ohka” has its Level reduced to 4 or lower with “Star Blast”, and it is Summoned without Tribute because it is now a Level 4 or lower monster, its effect to send itself to the Graveyard does not activate.

  
## STARDUST DRAGON  
> ① You can Tribute this card to negate the activation of a Spell Card, Trap Card, or Effect Monster’s effect that destroys a card(s) on the field, and destroy that card. ② If you negate an effect this way, you can Special Summon this card from your Graveyard during the End Phase.

Ⓒ This card cannot be Special Summoned except with its own effect or with "Assault Mode Activate". ① You can Tribute this card to negate the activation of a Spell Card, Trap Card, or Effect Monster's effect, and destroy that card. ② If you negate an effect this way, you can Special Summon this card from your Graveyard during the End Phase. ③ When this card on the field is destroyed, you can Special Summon 1 "Stardust Dragon" from your Graveyard.

    *   Tributing "Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode" is a cost.
    *   This negates the activation of a card / effect, even in the Damage Step \[[REF1](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=798093), [REF2](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=763404), [REF3](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=1233972)\].
        *   This includes Ignition-like Effect (ex: "Blaze Accelerator"), Quick-like Effects (ex: "Skull Lair"), and Trigger-like Effects (ex: "Blast with Chain").
    *   This effect CAN be activated if "Deck Devastation Virus" would destroy a face-up monster.

    *   This effect CANNOT be activated if this card is destroyed by Battle, even if "Red Dragon Archfiend" activates its effect in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation.

*   If your Defense Position "Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode" is attacked by "Red Dragon Archfiend" and it is destroyed by battle, its ① effect cannot be used to negate the effect of "Red Dragon Archfiend" that destroys your Defense Position monsters.
*   The ③ optional Trigger Effect targets a "Stardust Dragon" in your Graveyard.
    *   Even if a face-down Defense Position "[Red Dragon Archfiend/Assault Mode](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Red_Dragon_Archfiend/Assault_Mode)" etc. on the field is destroyed by a card effect, you can activate its effect that Special Summons "Red Dragon Archfiend" etc. from your Graveyard (this ruling also applies to "Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode").
    *   Even if "[Red Dragon Archfiend/Assault Mode](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Red_Dragon_Archfiend/Assault_Mode)" etc. is destroyed and banished, you can Special Summon "Red Dragon Archfiend" etc. from your Graveyard (this ruling also applies to "Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode").

## STARDUST XIAOLONG  
Special Summoning this monster is a Trigger Effect that that activates in the Graveyard.

*   If you have more than one “Stardust Xiaolong” in your Graveyard when you Synchro Summon “Stardust Dragon,” you can activate the effects of each of them.

  
## STATUE OF THE WICKED

*   This card is only activated if sent from the field to the Graveyard. There is no way to activate this card while it is Set on the field.
*   The effect of "Statue of the Wicked" is activated in the Graveyard, so its effect is activated even if "Jinzo" is on the field, because "Jinzo" only applies to Trap Cards and Trap Card effects on the field. Also, cards like "Seven Tools of the Bandit" cannot be used against "Statue of the Wicked".
*   "Statue of the Wicked" activates its effect even if it is destroyed on the same turn it was Set.
*   If "Banisher of the Light" is in play, then "Statue of the Wicked" does not activate its effect when destroyed, because it is not sent to the Graveyard.
*   "Statue of the Wicked" activates its effect even if you destroy your own "Statue of the Wicked".
*   You can Tribute a "Wicked Token".

  
## STAUNCH DEFENDER

*   This card only affects face-up Attack Position monsters on your opponent's side of the field that can attack.
*   Activating the card causes a replay.
*   Monsters Special Summoned during the Battle Phase after activation of "Staunch Defender" must also attack the monster selected by "Staunch Defender".
*   If your monster selected with "Staunch Defender" is destroyed, your opponent's remaining monsters cannot attack.
*   When your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to your "Staunch Defender" to destroy the selected monster, the effect of "Staunch Defender" is negated and battle is conducted normally.
*   While "Staunch Defender" is active, your opponent must still pay costs to attack with "Dark Elf", etc., if he/she attacks with that monster.
*   You cannot select "Guardian Kay'est" or "The Legendary Fisherman" for "Staunch Defender" if they cannot be attacked.
*   You can activate "Staunch Defender" when a monster affected by "Diffusion Wave Motion" declares an attack. The monster affected by "Diffusion Wave Motion" will then attack your selected monster once (and only once).
*   When you select "Spirit Reaper" or "The Reaper on the Nightmare" as the target of "Staunch Defender", resolve the chain, and after the effect of "Staunch Defender" resolves, the selected monster is destroyed. A replay will occur, but the opponent can no longer attack because the selected monster is gone.
*   If two "Staunch Defenders" are activated during the same turn, the last one to resolve will be the one that applies.
*   If "Absolute End" and "Staunch Defender" are both activated during the same turn, the last one to resolve will be the one that applies.

  
## STARLIGHT ROAD  
> Activate only when an effect is activated that would destroy 2 or more cards you control. Negate the effect and destroy that card. Then, you can Special Summon 1 “Stardust Dragon” from your Extra Deck.

*   This card can be activated when an effect would destroy 2(+) cards on the field simultaneously, even if some cards would be unaffected (ex: "Elemental Hero Wildheart" is unaffected by "Torrential Tribute").
    *   This card cannot be activated if an effect would only destroy 1 card you control (ex: "Celestia, Lightsworn Angel" / "Gladiator Beast Gyzarus" only targets 1 card with its effect).
    *   This card cannot be activated if an effect is not guaranteed to destroy 2(+) cards (ex: "Timewizard").
*   This card only negates card effects, it does not negate the activation of effects.
    *   This card cannot activate in the Damage Step.
*   This effect resolves sequentially. First, negate the effect and destroy that card, then (if "Starlight Road" destroyed that card) you can Special Summon 1 "Stardust Dragon" from your Extra Deck. Resolve the rest of the chain afterwards.
    *   VS. "Torrential Tribute": since "Starlight Road" does not negate the activation of the card / effect, "Torrential Tribute" can never be activated after the Chain because the Special Summon of "Stardust Dragon" was not the last thing to happen, the card / effect negated by "Starlight Road" resolved negated later in the Chain.
*   If this card negates the effect but does not destroy that card, you cannot Summon "Stardust Dragon".
    *   Example: Player A activates "Heavy Storm" and chains "Starlight Road" (Chain Link 2), Player B activates "Mystical Space Typhoon" (Chain Link 3) targeting "Heavy Storm". "Mystical Space Typhoon" destroys "Heavy Storm", "Starlight Road" negates the effect of "Heavy Storm" but didn't destroy it (Player A can't Summon "Stardust Dragon"), and "Heavy Storm" resolves negated.
    *   Example: Player A Synchro Summon "Black Rose Dragon" and activates its effect to destroy all cards on the field. Player B activates "Starlight Road". Resolving the chain: "Starlight Road" negates the effect of "Black Rose Dragon" and destroys it, Player B chooses to Special Summon 1 "Stardust Dragon", finally then the effect of "Black Rose Dragon" resolves negated. Player A cannot activate "Torrential Tribute" at this time, because "Stardust Dragon" was Summoned as Chain Link 2(+).

  
## STEALTHROID

*   If an effect is chained to your “Stealthroid’s” effect that removes every other “roid” monster from your side of the field, the effect of your “Stealthroid” disappears.

  
## STEAMROID

*   The effect of “Steamroid” is a Continuous Effect that cannot be chained to.

  
## STEEL SCORPION

*   If the affected monster is removed from the field or flipped face-down, it is not destroyed during the End Phase.

  
## STONE STATUE OF THE AZTECS

*   The Battle Damage doubled by "Stone Statue of the Aztecs"' effect is still considered Battle Damage (not effect damage).
*   If "Rod of the Mind's Eye" is equipped to "Stone Statue of the Aztecs", the Battle Damage will be 1000.
*   The Battle Damage is doubled during damage calculation.
*   When "Amazoness Swordswoman" (1500 ATK) attacks "Stone Statue of the Aztecs" (2000 DEF), the controller of Stone Statue of the Aztecs takes 1000 Battle Damage.

  
## STOP DEFENSE

*   Using "Stop Defense" on a face-down monster does not constitute a Flip Summon, so "Trap Hole" could not be used.

  
## STORM CALLER

*   "Storm Caller"'s second effect only activates when it is destroyed while on the field. If it is destroyed while face-down, its second effect activates.
*   If a Psychic-Type monster destroys your opponent's "Dark Magician of Chaos" by battle, you cannot return it to the top of your opponent's Deck.
*   If a Psychic-Type monster destroys your opponent's monster by battle while "Macro Cosmos" or "Dimensional Fissure" is active, you can return the destroyed monster to the top of your opponent's Deck. If you do not, the monster is removed from play.
*   If a Psychic-Type monsters destroys your opponent's "Crystal Beast" monster, you can return it to the top of your opponent's Deck. If you do not, the "Crystal Beast" monster can be placed into its controller's Spell and Trap Card Zone.
*   If a Psychic-Type monster destroys your monster that is controlled by your opponent, you cannot place it on top of your Deck.
*   You decide if you place your opponent's destroyed monster on top of their Deck at the end of the Damage Step, when monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the Graveyard.
*   If a Psychic-Type monster destroys your opponent's "Apprentice Magician" by battle, if you return it to the top of your opponent's Deck its effect does not activate.

  
## STORMING WYNN

*   This card’s effect is an Ignition Effect.
*   Tributing a monster is a cost. You cannot Tribute a monster if you do not have a monster with the appropriate Attribute in your hand to Special Summon.
*   If this card is flipped face-down, any monsters Special Summoned by her effect will not be destroyed. If this card is destroyed while she is face-down, any monsters Special Summoned by her effect will not be destroyed.
*   If a monster Special Summoned by this card’s effect is flipped face-down, it will not be destroyed when this card is destroyed.

  
## STRAIGHT FLUSH

*   If your opponent controls an "Embodiment of Apophis" as a Monster Card, it is not counted as a card in the Spell & Trap Card Zone (even though 1 of those Zones cannot be used). So you could not activate "Straight Flush".

  
## STRAY LAMBS

*   You cannot activate "Stray Lambs" the same turn that you Summon, Flip Summon, or Special Summon. But you can perform a Set the same turn. So you can activate "Stray Lambs" and then Tribute one of them to Set "Labyrinth Wall".
*   You can't activate "Stray Lambs" unless you have at least 2 vacant Monster Card Zones.

  
## STRIKE NINJA  
> ① You can remove this card from play until the End Phase of this turn by removing from play 2 DARK monsters in your Graveyard. You can use this effect during either player’s turn. You can only use this effect once per turn.

*   The ① Quick Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Banishing 2 DARK monsters in your Graveyard is a cost.
    *   This effect can't activate during the Damage Step.
    *   This effect may only be used once by each copy of "Strike Ninja" on the field.
    *   During the End Phase (this does not start a Chain), this card returns to the field (this is NOT a Special Summon) \[[REF](https://www.cogonline.net/forum/threads/strike-ninja-special-summon.38226/)\].

  
## STRONG WIND DRAGON

*   If you Tribute a face-down Dragon for “Strong Wind Dragon,” it will still get its ATK boost.
*   “Strong Wind Dragon” gains half the Tributed Dragon’s original ATK (in the Graveyard), not half of the Dragon’s ATK as it was on the field.
*   “Strong Wind Dragon” will get its ATK boost even if you Tribute a monster that was treated as Dragon-Type because of “DNA Surgery.”

  
## STUMBLING  
> Any monster that is Normal Summoned, Flip Summoned, or Special Summoned is changed to Defense Position.

*   The mandatory Trigger-like Effect always starts a Chain in the Summon response timing, even if the monster was Summoned by a card effect as Chain Link 2(+).
*   This effect activates as soon as a monster is successfully Summoned (or simultaneously with any mandatory Trigger Effects) before optional Trigger Effects ("Red Gadget") or chained Spell / Trap Cards (Trap Hole). This supersedes Ignition Effect Priority.
    *   Example: Player A controls "Stumbling" and a set "Trap Hole". Player B Normal Summons "Exiled Force". "Stumbling’s" mandatory Trigger-like Effect immediately starts a chain as Chain Link 1. Player B CANNOT claim 'priority' to activate "Exiled Force’s" effect, but activates "Mystical Space Typhoon" as Chain Link 2 targeting "Stumbling". Player A responds by activating "Trap Hole" as Chain Link 3. When resolving the chain, "Trap Hole" destroys "Exiled Force", then "Mystical Space Typhoon" destroys "Stumbling" and the chain is considered resolved (as "Stumbling" is longer face-up on the field to allow for Chain Link 1 to resolve). The last thing to happen in this case was the destruction of "Stumbling".

  
## STYGIAN DIRGE

*   Multiple copies of “Stygian Dirge” accumulate their effects.

  
## SUBSTITOAD  
> ① You can Tribute 1 monster to Special Summon 1 "Frog" monster from your Deck, except "Frog the Jam". ② "Frog" monsters, except "Frog the Jam", cannot be destroyed by battle.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Tributing 1 (face-up / face-down) monster you control is a cost.
    *   This effect can be activated more than once per turn.
    *   This effect cannot be activated if you do not have any eligible "Frog" monsters in your Deck.
*   The ② Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   Battle Damage and Piercing Battle Damage are calculated normally.
    *   Your "Frog" monsters can still be destroyed by card effects.

  
## SUCCESS PROBABILITY 0%  
> Send 2 random Fusion Monsters from your opponent's Fusion Deck to the Graveyard.

*   If your opponent has no Extra Deck, you cannot activate “Success Probability 0%”.
*   “Success Probability 0%” does not target, because the cards are chosen randomly.
*   When this effect resolves, your opponent seperates their Extra Deck into the Synchro Deck and the Fusion Deck. You then send 2 random cards from the Fusion Deck to the Graveyard \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=812022)\].

  
## SUIJIN

*   A marker may be placed on this card to indicate that its effect has been used. The effect resets if the monster is destroyed or removed from the field.
*   You can use the effect of this card even if it is face-down when it is attacked because its effect is activated during the Damage Step, and it will be face-up at that point.
*   The effect of this card targets.

  
## SUMMON CLOUD

*   The effect of “Summon Cloud” does not target.
*   When you activate “Summon Cloud”, you cannot yet Special Summon a “Cloudian” monster. After “Summon Cloud” resolves, you can activate its effect to Special Summon a “Cloudian” monster in a separate Chain.
*   The effect of destroying “Summon Cloud” is applied after Special Summoning the “Cloudian” monster and does not begin another Chain.

  
## SUMMON LIMIT  
> Neither player can Summon more than two times per turn.

*   The Continuous-like Effect does not activate.
    *   This effect counts all Summon events performed during the turn. (ex: "Scapegoat" is only 1 Summon event, since the 4 monsters are Summoned simultaneously).
    *   The limit applies to Normal / Flip / Tribute / Special Summons.
    *   Summons performed before "Summon Limit" resolved are counted towards the limit. After "Summon Limit" resolves, a player that already Summoned twice cannot Summon any more monsters this turn.
    *   A negated Summon (ex: "Chaos Sorcerer") still counts towards the limit.
    *   An Effect (ex: "Debris Dragon") that is negated (by "Skill Drain") still counts towards the limit.
    *   An Effect (ex: "Instant Fusion") whose activation is negated (by "Dark Bribe") does not count towards the limit.

  
## SUMMON REACTOR SK

*   The effect that inflicts damage can activate even during the Damage Step.
*   If “Magical Dimension” Summons a monster and destroys “Summon Reactor ・SK”, then 800 damage is not inflicted to the opponent.
*   But if “Magical Dimension” destroys a different monster instead, then “Summon Reactor ・SK” will inflict the 800 damage. If your “Summon Reactor ・SK” is Summoned at the same time as an opponent’s monster (example: “Dimension Fusion”), then it will not inflict 800 damage to the opponent at that time.
*   The effect that negates attacks activates when the attack is declared, and targets the attacking monster.
*   If the effect of “Summon Reactor ・SK” that inflicts 800 damage is negated by “By Order of the Emperor”, you cannot later use its effect to negate an attack that turn.

  
## SUMMONER OF ILLUSIONS

*   Tributing 1 monster is a cost.
*   You must use "Summoner of Illusions"’ effect when it is flipped face-up, either by Flip Summon or by being attacked. If you have no cards in your Extra Deck, the effect cannot activate and you do not Tribute 1 monster.
*   If you use "Dimensionhole" on the Fusion Monster summoned by this card’s effect, it will return during your next Standby Phase and not be destroyed.
*   If the Fusion Monster summoned by this card’s effect is flipped face-down it will not be destroyed during your End Phase, since the condition is reset when the monster becomes face-down.

  
## SUMMONER'S ART

*   You cannot activate this card if you have no Level 5 or higher Normal Monsters in your Deck.

  
## SUN DRAGON INTI

*   Destroying the monster that destroyed this card does not target. Special Summoning “Moon Dragon Quilla” does target.
*   The effect to Special Summon “Moon Dragon Quilla” activates even if “Sun Dragon Inti” is not in the Graveyard during the Standby Phase as long as there is a “Moon Dragon Quilla” in the Graveyard.
*   If “Sun Dragon Inti” is on the field or in the Extra Deck during the Standby Phase then its effect to Special Summon “Moon Dragon Quilla” activates and “Divine Wrath” is Chained, the effect is negated but “Sun Dragon Inti” is not destroyed.
*   Destroying your opponent’s monster and dealing damage happen at the same time. The damage is half of the monster’s ATK on the field.
*   The effect to Special Summon “Moon Dragon Quilla” does not activate in any specific place, regardless of where “Sun Dragon Inti” is at the time. “Light Imprisoning Mirror” cannot negate it.

  
## SUPAY

*   Doubling the ATK and setting the condition to return the monster during the End Phase are both part of the resolution of “Supay’s” Trigger Effect. The effect of “Supay” activates even if destroyed during the Damage Step.

  
## SUPER DOUBLE SUMMON

*   The effect of returning the Gemini Monster to its owner’s hand during the End Phase does not begin a Chain.
*   If the Gemini Monster Normal Summoned by “Super Double Summon” is flipped face-down or removed from the field, the effect to return it to its owner’s hand during the End Phase is not applied.
*   You can activate “Super Double Summon” and select a Gemini Monster that is having its effect negated by “Skill Drain”. The Gemini Monster will be treated as having been Normal Summoned while face-up on the field, but the effects it gains will be negated by “Skill Drain”. If “Skill Drain” is negated or removed from the field later in the turn, the selected Gemini Monster’s effects will be active and can be used.

  
## SUPER JUNIOR CONFRONTATION

*   “Super Junior Confrontation” does not target.
*   If you do not control a face-up Defense Position monster, you cannot activate “Super Junior Confrontation”.
*   If “Super Junior Confrontation” is activated and there is a tie for lowest ATK among the opponent’s monsters, the player who activated the card gets to choose which monster attacks.
*   When the battle for “Super Junior Confrontation” resolves, the Battle Phase ends immediately. There is no opportunity to activate additional cards.
*   “Super Junior Confrontation” does not change any monsters’ battle positions.

  
## SUPER POLYMERIZATION

*   "Super Polymerization" does not target. The Fusion Material Monsters are sent to the Graveyard when "Super Polymerization" resolves.
    *   After Fusion Materials are removed from the field, the last thing to happen is the Fusion Summon.
*   "Super Polymeriation" prevents effects from being chained, but Continous Effects are still applied.
*   If "Super Polymerization" is activated while "Light and Darkness Dragon" is face-up on the field, "Light and Darkness Dragon"'s effect does not activate.
*   If "Super Polymerization" is activated while "Spell Absorption" is active, the player who controls "Spell Absorption" gains Life Points.

  
## SUPER REJUVENATION  
> Ⓛ During the End Phase of the turn this card is activated, draw 1 card from your Deck for each Dragon-Type monster discarded from your hand and/or Tributed during this turn.

*   This effect counts monsters that were Dragon-Type when Tributed / Discarded.
    *   Monsters treated as Dragon-Type (by "DNA Surgery") that are Tributed are still counted.
    *   Dragon-Types Tributed on the field while "Zombie World" is active are not counted.
    *   Your opponent's Dragon-Types Tributed by "Soul Exchange" are still counted.
    *   Dragon-Types Tributed / Discarded from hand while "Zombie World" applies are still counted \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=767781)\].
*   The Ⓛ Lingering Effect resolves during the End Phase without starting a chain.
    *   This effect is cumulative. If multiple copies of "Super Rejuvenation" are activated in the same turn, you resolve each one at a time during the End Phase.
*   If "Solemn Wishes" is active, you will gain 500 for every card you draw. If you draw 3 cards then you gain 1500 Life Points.
*   You CANNOT activate this card while your opponent controls "Protector of the Sanctuary".
*   You CANNOT activate this card in the Damage Step.
*   You CANNOT activate this card after discarding for hand limit in the End Phase, as it is the very last action that occurs in a turn.
    *   Cards / Effects CANNOT activate beyond this point unless discarding triggers a mandatory effect. Only Counter Trap Cards and mandatory effects may activate in the resulting Chain.
    *   Example: It is Player A's End Phase and they have a Set "Divine Wrath" from a previous turn. Player A discards two copies of "The White Stone of Legend" to bring their hand size down to 6 cards. However, "The White Stone of Legend" has a mandatory Trigger Effect to add a "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" from the Deck to the hand, and Player B controls a "Doomcaliber Knight". Thus, a chain is built with both "The White Stone of Legend"'s effects forming a chain as Chain Links 1 and 2, and "Doomcaliber Knight" Tributing itself as Chain Link 3. Player A activates "Divine Wrath" as Chain Link 4 and discards a card as cost. When resolving the chain, "Divine Wrath" will successfully negate the effect of "Doomcaliber Knight", then both effects of "The White Stone of Legend" will add a copy of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" to Player A's hand (should any remain in the Deck). Once the chain has resolved, no chains may be built (unless mandatory Trigger/Trigger-like Effects were activated) and Player A must once again discard down to their hand limit and the turn ends.

  
## SUPER ROBOLADY

*   The effect of this card to Special Summon "Super Roboyarou" is Spell Speed 1 and can only be activated during your Main Phase 1 or 2.
*   A "Super Roboyarou" Special Summoned by this card’s effect is not considered properly Summoned. So if it is destroyed, you cannot target it with "Monster Reborn".

  
## SUPER ROBOYAROU

*   The effect of this card to Special Summon "Super Robolady" is Spell Speed 1 and can only be activated during your Main Phase 1 or 2.
*   A "Super Robolady" Special Summoned by this card’s effect is not considered properly Summoned. So if it is destroyed, you cannot target it with "Monster Reborn".

  
## SUPER SOLAR NUTRIENT

*   Calculate the maximum Level of monster you can Special Summon based on the Level of the Tributed monster when it was on the field.
*   “Super Solar Nutrient” does not target a monster in your hand or Deck.
*   However, it does target the Special Summoned monster after it is Special Summoned.
*   Tributing a Plant for this card’s activation is a cost.

  
## SUPER VEHICROID - STEALTH UNION

*   You can equip “Super Vehicroid – Stealth Union” with more than 1 monster with its effect. (Although you can only activate the equipping effect once per turn)
*   You cannot select a face-down monster to equip to “Super Vehicroid – Stealth Union” because a face-down monster’s Monster Type cannot be determined.
*   When “Super Vehicroid – Stealth Union” is equipped with a monster by its effect and it attacks 1 of your opponent’s monsters, if “Super Vehicroid – Stealth Union” declares an attack against another of your opponent’s monsters and in response the equipped monster(s) are removed so that “Super Vehicroid – Stealth Union” is no longer equipped with any monsters by its effect, it will not be able to attack all monsters your opponent controls and the declared attack does not continue to the Damage Step (the attack stops).
*   When “Super Vehicroid – Stealth Union” is Fusion Summoned by “Vehicroid Connection Zone” and afterwards the “Super Vehicroid – Stealth Union” activates its effect to equip with a monster, “Divine Wrath” can be chained to negate the effect but the “Super Vehicroid – Stealth Union” will not be destroyed.
*   The halving of “Super Vehicroid – Stealth Union’s” original ATK occurs at the time it declares an attack and is applied until the end of the Damage Step.

  
## SUPERNATURAL REGENERATION

*   You count Psychic monsters sent to any Graveyard, including your opponent’s.
*   “Zombie World” will change all Psychic monsters into Zombies, including in the Graveyard, so any Psychic monsters sent to the Graveyard will be Zombies instead, and will not count for “Supernatural Regeneration” (in fact, you cannot activate “Supernatural Regeneration” in that case).
*   Effects that change Type on the field, like “DNA Surgery”, will not apply in the Graveyard, so Psychic monsters sent to the Graveyard while “DNA Surgery” is active still count as “Psychic-Type monsters sent to the Graveyard this turn” (so you gain Life Points for them).
*   Returning Psychic monsters to the Graveyard (with “Miracle Dig”, etc.) does not count as “sending” them to the Graveyard, so they do not count for “Supernatural Regeneration”.
*   Even if Psychic monsters sent to the Graveyard are no longer in the Graveyard during the End Phase, they still can count for “Supernatural Regeneration”.

  
## SUPERVISE  
> Ⓒ Equip only to a Gemini monster. ① It is treated as an Effect Monster, and gains its effect(s). ② When this face-up card on the field is sent to the Graveyard, select and Special Summon 1 Normal Monster from your Graveyard.

*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated.
    *   This card can be equipped to a Gemini Monster which has gained its effects.
*   The ① Continuous-like Effect does not activate.
    *   If "Spell Canceller" negates this effect, the equipped Gemini Monster can be 'Gemini Summoned'.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger-like Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect can activate in the Damage Step.
    *   This effect targets 1 Normal / Gemini Monster in the Graveyard. You cannot target a non-Effect Fusion / Synchro Monster.
    *   This effect will still activates "Dust Tornado" destroys "Supervise" before it becomes equipped.
    *   If this card and the equipped Gemini Monster are destroyed together, you can Special Summon it.

  
## SUPERALLOY BEAST RAPTINUS

*   When “Doom Shaman’s” effect is activated to Special Summon 1 Fiend-Type monster while “Superalloy Beast Raptinus” is face-up on the field, if “Superalloy Beast Raptinus” is removed from the field or flipped face-down “Doom Shaman” will be treated as a Normal Monster again, but the Fiend-Type monster is still Special Summoned.
*   When “Chthonian Emperor Dragon” declares its second attack during the Battle Phase while “Superalloy Beast Raptinus” is face-up on the field, if “Superalloy Beast Raptinus” is removed from the field or flipped face-down “Chthonian Emperor Dragon” will be treated as a Normal Monster and its attack will stop because it no longer has an effect allowing it to attack twice during the Battle Phase.

  
## SUPERANCIENT DEEPSEA KING COELACANTH  
> ① Once per turn, you can discard 1 card to Special Summon as many Level 4 or lower Fish-Type monsters as possible from your Deck. A monster Special Summoned by this effect cannot declare an attack and its effect(s) is negated while on the field. ② If this card is targeted by a Spell, Trap, or Effect Monster's effect, you can Tribute 1 other Fish-Type monster to negate the effect and destroy that card.

*   The ① Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Discarding 1 card is a cost.
    *   This effect must Summon as many Level 4 or lower Fish-Type monsters from your Deck as possible. You cannot Special Summon only 1 Fish-Type while you have 3 open Monster Card Zones, unless it is the only Level 4 or lower Fish-Type monster remaining in your Deck.
*   The ② Quick Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Tributing 1 other Fish-Type monster is a cost. You cannot Tribute this card for its own effect.
    *   This negates the activation of effects that target this card (ex: "Blaze Accelerator", "Exiled Force").
    *   This effect can be activated multiple times during the same turn, and even in the Damage Step.

  
## SUPER-ELECTROMAGNETIC VOLTECH DRAGON

*   If you Tribute Summon this card by Tributing a “Batteryman” monster, this card’s Trigger Effect can be chained to. After the Trigger Effect resolves, “Voltech Dragon” then has the appropriate effect applied to it. So if you Tributed “Batteryman D”, the opponent may activate “Trap Hole” as a chain to the effect of “Voltech Dragon” and destroy “Voltech Dragon” before it can negate the effects of Spell & Trap Cards that target it. (In other words, by chaining to the effect that would give “Voltech Dragon” immunity, you can destroy it before it becomes immune.)
*   You can activate “Divine Wrath” when this card is Tribute Summoned if a “Batteryman” monster was Tributed.

  
## SUPPLY

*   You must have 2 Fusion Material Monsters in YOUR Graveyard otherwise this card’s effect will disappear when flipped.
*   If you have Fusion Summoned 2 Fusion Monsters during the course of the Duel, you may return 1 Fusion Material Monster from each of them with this card’s effect. In other words, the returned Fusion Material Monsters do not need to be part of the same Fusion.

  
## SUPREMACY BERRY

*   You cannot activate “Supremacy Berry” when both players’ Life Points are the same. If “Supremacy Berry” is sent to the Graveyard with “Destiny Hero – Diamond Dude,” nothing happens, since “Supremacy Berry” was not ‘activated’.

  
## SUSA SOLDIER

*   When this card inflicts Battle Damage to the opponent it is halved, regardless if it was a direct attack, or from an attack against another monster. For example, if your "Susa Soldier" (ATK 2000) attacks the opponent’s "Gemini Elf" (ATK 1900), the opponent will take 50 points of Battle Damage. The damage points are rounded up when there is a fraction.

  
## SWALLOW FLIP  
> Negate the activation of an Effect Monster's effect that activates when a monster is Special Summoned (including itself), and destroy it.

*   This effect activates in the Summon response timing (like "Archlord Kristya").
*   If a monster effect activates in response to a Special Summon (ex: "King Tiger Wanghu"), you can activate this card.
*   This effect does not target.
*   When a Special Summoned monster activates its effect (ex: “Archlord Kristya”) while “Light and Darkness Dragon” is face-up, the effect of the Summoned monster will be Chain Link 1 and “Light and Darkness Dragon” will be Chain Link 2. Therefore, “Swallow Flip” cannot activate as it cannot negate the effect of the Special Summoned monster.
*   This card cannot be activated in response to an Ignition Effect activated in the Summon response timing via Ignition Effect Priority.

  
## SWAP FROG  
> Ⓢ You can discard 1 WATER monster to Special Summon this card from your hand. ① When this card is Summoned, you can select and sent 1 Level 2 or lower Aqua-Type WATER monster from your Deck or your side of the field to the Graveyard. ② Once per turn, you can return 1 monster you control to the hand to Normal Summon 1 “Frog” monster, except “Swap Frog” or “Frog the Jam”, in addition to your Normal Summon or Set this turn.

*   TheⓈ Summon Effect does not start a chain.
    *   Discarding 1 WATER monster is a cost.
*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect can be activated multiple times per turn.
    *   This effect cannot activate if this card is Summoned as Chain Link 2(+) (by "Call of the Haunted").
*   The ② Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Returning 1 monster you control (even itself) to the hand is a cost. You CANNOT return a Fusion / Synchro Monster to the Extra Deck as cost, nor can you return a "Battle Fader" / "Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord" Special Summoned by its effect as it is banished instead.
    *   This effect can be activated with Ignition Effect Priority in response to this card's Summon if the ① optional Trigger Effect isn't activated.
    *   This effect can only be used once while each copy of "Swap Frog" is face-up on the field.
    *   You only gain 1 extra Normal Summon by this effect in a turn.
    *   The additional Normal Summon can be used before your regular Normal Summon / Set of that turn.
    *   The additional Normal Summon / Set IS cummulative with "Double Summon".
    *   You can activate this effect again this turn, even if you have already performed the additional Normal Summon (ex: you Special Summoned "Swap Frog" later that turn) \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=1044244)\].
    *   VS. "Doomcaliber Knight": If "Swap Frog" uses this effect and returns itself to the hand as cost, "Doomcaliber Knight" will tribute itself to negate the effect, but it will not destroy "Swap Frog" since it is considered a different card in the hand (not the same card that activated the effect on the field).

  
## SWIFT BIRDMAN JOE

*   This effect is a Trigger Effect that can be chained to.
*   This effect will activate if you Tribute a monster whose Attribute was changed to WIND by a card effect, such as “Homunculus the Alchemic Being”.

  
## SWIFT GAIA THE FIERCE KNIGHT

*   "Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight" and "Gaia the Fierce Knight" are considered 2 separate monsters so you can have 3 of each in your Deck.
*   You can’t use "Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight" as Fusion Material for "Gaia the Dragon Champion".
*   You can use "Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight"’s effect to Summon it (without Tribute) using "Ultimate Offering".
*   Your opponent can use "Trap Hole" against "Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight" because it’s a Normal Summon.
*   You cannot Set "Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight" with "Major Riot", even if "Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight" is the only card in your hand.
*   You cannot chain to the effect of "Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight" because it’s treated as a Normal Summon. But you can respond to the Normal Summon just like you would to any other Summon.

  
## SWIFT SAMURAI STORM!

*   You cannot activate this card during the Damage Step.
*   This card’s ATK increasing effect does not start a Chain.
*   The ATK increase happens at the end of the Damage Step the first time a “Six Samurai” monster you control battles that turn.
*   Any given “Six Samurai” can only gain the ATK increase once per turn, after the first time a “Six Samurai” battles while it is on the field. (Example: You control 2 “Six Samurai” monsters, Irou and Yaichi and a face-up “Swift Samurai Storm!”. Irou battles, and Irou and Yaichi gain 300 ATK. If you then use “Call of the Haunted” to Special Summon “The Six Samurai – Nisashi”, he will not automatically gain 300 ATK. If Yaichi battles, then Nisashi will gain 300 ATK.)
*   If “The Six Samurai – Irou” attacks a face-down monster and destroys it with his effect, it is not considered to have been destroyed by battle. The effect of “Swift Samurai Storm!” will not be applied.
*   The ATK increase only affects “Six Samurai” monsters that were face-up when it was applied.

  
## SWING OF MEMORIES

*   If the Normal Monster Special Summoned by “Swing of Memories” is flipped face-down, it will not be destroyed during the End Phase. Even if the Normal Monster is flipped face-up during the same turn, it will not be destroyed during the End Phase.
*   If the Normal Monster Special Summoned by “Swing of Memories” is removed from play with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, it will not be destroyed during the End Phase even after it is returned to the field.

  
## SWORD HUNTER

*   If you take control of your opponent's "Sword Hunter" and destroy a monster by battle, the monster is placed into your Spell and Trap Card Zone and remains there when control of "Sword Hunter" is returned to your opponent.
*   While "Imperial Order" is active, you do not gain ATK for the Monster Cards equipped to "Sword Hunter".
*   If the monster destroyed by battle with "Sword Hunter" is Special Summoned from the Graveyard before the end of the Battle Phase, it is not equipped to "Sword Hunter".

  
## SWORD MASTER

*   This effect activates if your opponent’s monster is not destroyed during damage calculation.
*   The attacking monster must be Warrior-Type the entire time from attack declaration until the end of the Damage Step in order to Special Summon “Sword Master.”
*   If your opponent’s monster is destroyed by a card effect while your Warrior-Type monster is attacking, it is still not destroyed by battle, so you can Special Summon “Sword Master.”

  
## SWORD OF DARK RITES

*   This card's effect to return itself to the hand starts a Chain.

  
## SWORD OF DEEP-SEATED

*   "Sword of Deep-Seated"'s second effect is a Trigger Effect.
*   If your "Sangan" equipped with your "Sword of Deep-Seated" is sent to the Graveyard, the effect of "Sangan" and "Sword of Deep-Seated" form a Chain. You decide their order on the Chain.
*   If "Sword of Deep-Seated" is sent to the Graveyard while resolving "Reasoning", its effect starts a new Chain after you finish resolving "Reasoning".

  
## SWORD OF KUSANAGI

*   "Sword of Kusanagi"'s second effect activates in the Graveyard.
*   If you control your opponent's Spirit Monster and you equip it with "Sword of Kusanagi", when the Spirit Monster is returned to your opponent's hand and "Sword of Kusanagi" is destroyed, its second effect activates.
*   If you add your opponent's "Sword of Kusanagi" to your hand with "Exchange" and equip it to a Spirit Monster you control, when the Spirit Monster is returned to its owner's hand and "Sword of Kusanagi" is destroyed, "Sword of Kusanagi"'s effect does not activate.

  
## SWORD OF SPARKLES

*   Tributing 1 monster is a cost to activate the effect to return “Sword of Sparkles” to your Deck. If “Sword of Sparkles” is equipped to a monster that is unaffected by Spells, the effect to destroy 1 card your opponent controls still applies. Both effects of this card start a Chain.

  
## SWORD OF THE SOUL-EATER

*   You can activate "Sword of the Soul-Eater" even if the monster you're equipping it to is the only monster on the field.

  
## SWORDS OF CONCEALING LIGHT

*   If your second Standby Phase after activation of “Swords of Concealing Light” is skipped with “Solomon’s Lawbook”, etc., then “Swords of Concealing Light” is not destroyed and remains active on the field until removed from the field by another effect.
*   While your “Swords of Concealing Light” is active on the field, your opponent can still Summon new monsters in Attack Position.
*   Because “Swords of Concealing Light” is a Continuous Spell Card (unlike “Swords of Revealing Light”), if “Mystical Space Typhoon” is chained to its activation and destroys it, none of its effects will resolve (including the effect that changes your opponent’s monsters to face-down Defense Position).
*   While “Swords of Concealing Light” is active, monsters can still have their battle positions changed with card effects like “Enemy Controller” and “Bite Shoes”.
*   The effect of “Swords of Concealing Light” that destroys itself in the Standby Phase does not start a chain.
*   Since there’s no such thing as a face-down Monster Token, Monster Tokens are simply changed to Defense Position when the effect of “Swords of Concealing Light” is applied.

  
## SWORDS OF REVEALING LIGHT

*   This card remains on the field and is active until the end of your opponent’s third turn. This card must be on the field for its effect to be active.
*   If this card is destroyed or removed from the field by the effect of another card, such as "Heavy Storm" or "Giant Trunade", the opponent may then attack.
*   If multiple Flip Effect monsters are flipped face-up by the effect of "Swords of Revealing Light" the effects are activated simultaneously and follow the rules for simultaneous effects found in the "Advanced Gameplay" section of this website.
*   If "Imperial Order" is active on the field you can still activate "Swords of Revealing Light" and it will maintain its turn count, but it will NOT flip monsters face-up or prevent the opponent from attacking. If "Imperial Order" is destroyed after "Swords of Revealing Light" has been on the field for two of your opponent’s turns, it will only prevent your opponent from attacking for one turn and then be destroyed.

  
## SYMBOL OF HERITAGE

*   “Symbol of Heritage” targets 1 monster in the Graveyard. If your opponent chains “Disappear” to remove from play the targeted monster, the effect of “Symbol of Heritage” does not resolve. But if they chain “Disappear” to remove a different monster with the same name, then the targeted monster is still Special Summoned even though there are now only 2 of it in the Graveyard.

  
## SYMBOLS OF DUTY  
> Send 1 Normal Monster you control to the Graveyard. Select and Special Summon 1 monster from either Graveyard and equip it with this card. When this card is removed from the field, destroy the equipped monster.

*   If the monster targeted by “Synchro Control” is flipped face-down before the effect resolves you do not gain control of it.

  
## SYNCHRO DEFLECTOR

*   "Synchro Deflector" targets your opponent's monster that will be destroyed.

  
## SYNCHRO STRIKE

*   You cannot target a Synchro Monster when it is Special Summoned from the Graveyard.
*   You cannot target a Synchro Monster that was turned face-down by “Book of Moon”, etc., when it is later Flip Summoned.

  
## SYNTHETIC SERAPHIM

*   This card's effect is Continuous. It Special Summons a Token whenever a Counter Trap Card resolves, even during a resolving chain.
*   After the "Synthetic Seraphim" Token is Special Summoned, when the Chain has finished resolving it may be Tributed to activate "Voltanis the Adjudicator"'s first effect.

  
## SYSTEM DOWN  
> Pay 1000 Life Points. ① Remove from play all Machine-Type monsters on your opponent's side of the field and in their Graveyard.

*   Paying 1000 Life Points is a cost.
*   The ① effect does not destroy Machine-Type monsters, it only removes them from play.
    *   This does not affect face-down Machines.
    *   This does not affect Machine-Types treated as Equip Spell Cards (such as Union Monsters).
    *   If your opponent controls “Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer”, Machines in the Graveyard are not removed from play, but Machines on the field can still be removed from play by its effect.

  
## T.A.D.P.O.L.E.

*   If you choose to activate the effect of “T.A.D.P.O.L.E.”, it can be chained to. If you activate the effect, you must add “T.A.D.P.O.L.E.(s)” to your hand.

  
## TACTICAL ESPIONAGE EXPERT

*   The effect of this monster prevents the activation of Trap Cards that can be activated when a monster is Normal Summoned, such as "Trap Hole" and "Torrential Tribute".
*   You can activate Trap Cards later in the turn.
*   You can negate the Normal Summon of this monsters with "Horn of Heaven" or "Solemn Judgment". (In which case the Normal Summon failed and the effect of the monster is not applied.)
*   The effect of this monster is applied to both players (so you cannot activate "Pineapple Blast" in response to your Normal Summon of this monster).
*   This is a Continuous Effect that you cannot chain to.

  
## TALISMAN OF SPELL SEALING

*   While "Royal Decree" and "Talisman of Spell Sealing" are both active, and "Sealmaster Meisei" is removed from the field, "Talisman of Spell Sealing" stays on the field, but if "Royal Decree"'s effect is no longer being applied, "Talisman of Spell Sealing" is destroyed.
*   "Talisman of Spell Sealing" is destroyed immediately when "Sealmaster Meisei" is not on the field. If your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to "Talisman of Spell Sealing" to destroy "Sealmaster Meisei", "Talisman of Spell Sealing" is immediately destroyed when "Ring of Destruction" resolves.
*   If you have "Talisman of Spell Sealing" and "Talisman of Trap Sealing", the controller can select which effect will be applied. If both players have both, the turn player chooses which effect is applied.

  
## TALISMAN OF TRAP SEALING

*   While "Imperial Order" and "Talisman of Trap Sealing" are both active, and "Sealmaster Meisei" is removed from the field, "Talisman of Trap Sealing" stays on the field, but if "Imperial Order"'s effect is no longer being applied, "Talisman of Trap Sealing" is destroyed.
*   "Talisman of Trap Sealing" is destroyed immediately when "Sealmaster Meisei" is not on the field. If your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to "Talisman of Trap Sealing" to destroy "Sealmaster Meisei", "Talisman of Trap Sealing" is immediately destroyed when "Ring of Destruction" resolves.
*   If you have "Talisman of Spell Sealing" and "Talisman of Trap Sealing", the controller can select which effect will be applied. If both players have both, the turn player chooses which effect is applied.
*   If you have "Talisman of Trap Sealing" and "Sealmaster Meisei" is destroyed in a battle that causes you to take 2000 or more damage, you cannot activate "Nutrient Z".

  
## TAUNT

*   If a monster selected by "Taunt" is moved to the turn player’s side of the field, the turn player can conduct attacks normally without worrying about the effect of "Taunt", because without a card effect that allows it, a player cannot attack monsters on his own side of the field.
*   If multiple monsters are selected by multiple "Taunts", the turn player selects 1 of the monsters selected by "Taunt" and can attack it.
*   If 1 monster is selected by "Taunt" and another is equipped with "Ring of Magnetism", the turn player must attack the monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" if he attacks.

  
## TELEKINETIC POWER WELL

*   “Telekinetic Power Well” targets 1 or more Psychic monsters in your Graveyard. If an effect is chained that removes some of those monsters from play, the remaining monsters are still Summoned. You only take damage based on the monsters that are actually Summoned.

  
## TELEKINETIC SHOCKER

*   Paying 500 Life Points is a cost.
*   You pay 500 Life Points and destroy "Telekinetic Shocker" when a face-up Psychic-Type monster on the field would be destroyed, including a Psychic-Type monster your opponent controls. This effect does not use the Chain.
*   If 2 or more face-up Psychic-Type monsters would be destroyed by the same effect, you can destroy "Telekinetic Shocker" instead and the Psychic-Type monsters are not destroyed. If "Telekinetic Shocker" will also be destroyed by the same effect, you cannot use its effect.

## TELEPORT

*   Paying 800 Life Points is a cost.
*   When you first activate (from your hand or flip face-up on the field) "Teleport", you cannot also activate its effect. After its activation resolves, you can start a new Chain by activating its effect.

  
## TEMPLE OF THE SUN

*   If a monster Special Summoned from the Graveyard is removed from play temporarily by “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” and then returned later, it still gains the bonus from “Temple of the Sun.”
*   If your opponent Special Summons a monster from the Graveyard and you take control of it, it will gain the bonus from “Temple of the Sun” while you control it.
*   Monsters Special Summoned before and after the activation of “Temple of the Sun” will still gain the bonus from “Temple of the Sun.”

*   You can Set or Special Summon a "Terrorking Archfiend" even if there are no Archfiend Monster Cards on your side of the field.

  
## TEST TIGER  
> ① If you control a "Gladiator Beast" monster, you can Special Summon this card. ② You can Tribute this card to return 1 "Gladiator Beast" monster you control to the Deck, and then Special Summon 1 "Gladiator Beast" from your Deck. The Special Summoned monster is treated as if it was Special Summoned by the effect of a "Gladiator Beast" monster.

*   The ① Unclassified Effect Special Summons this card without starting a Chain.
    *   This effect does not activate.
*   The ② Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Tributing this card is a cost.
    *   This effect targets 1 face-up "Gladiator Beast" monster you control. You can even target a "Gladiator Beast" Fusion Monster, it is returned to the Extra Deck when this effect resolves.

    *   You can Special Summon the same "Gladiator Beast" monster that you returned to your Deck, unless the "Gladiator Beast" monster has an effect preventing you from doing so, like "Gladiator Beast Alexander".

  
## TETHYS, GODDESS OF LIGHT  
> ① When you draw a Fairy-Type monster(s), you can reveal 1 of those monsters to draw 1 more card.

*   This ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   1 Fairy-Type monster you JUST drew is revealed to your opponent at activation.
    *   This effect can be activated during the Damage Step.
    *   If you control 2(+) copies of Tethys, their effects can all activate in a single Chain when you draw a single Fairy-Type monster.
    *   This effect cannot activate if you drew a Fairy-Type as Chain Link 2(+).
    *   This effect cannot activate if you draw a Fairy-Type by "Upstart Goblin", which resolves sequentially. The last thing to happen is your opponent gaining 1000 Life Points, not you drawing a Fairy.

  
## THE A. FORCES

*   Multiple copies of "The A. Forces" are cumulative. For example, if you control 3 Warrior-Type monsters and have 2 copies of "The A. Forces" active, each Warrior-Type monster has its ATK increased by 1200 points.

  
## THE AGENT OF CREATION - VENUS

*   You can activate "The Agent of Creation - Venus"' effect multiple times in the same turn.
*   You get the "Mystical Shine Ball" when "The Agent of Creation - Venus"' effect resolves.
*   You have to shuffle your Deck after searching for the "Mystical Shine Ball".

## THE AGENT OF FORCE - MARS

*   "The Agent of Force - Mars" is unaffected by Spell Cards just like "Guardian Kay'est" and "The Legendary Fisherman".
*   Vs. "Reverse Trap", "The Agent of Force - Mars"' ATK & DEF become zero but cannot go below zero.
*   If "The Agent of Force - Mars" attacks "Reflect Bounder", "Reflect Bounder" deals damage based on "The Agent of Force - Mars"' current ATK, so if it has 2000 ATK, then "Reflect Bounder" inflicts 2000 damage; then recalculate "The Agent of Force - Mars"' ATK before performing damage calculation.
*   When your face-down Defense Position "The Agent of Force - Mars" is attacked, its DEF is increased BEFORE damage calculation.

  
## THE AGENT OF JUDGMENT - SATURN

*   Tributing "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn" is a cost.

*   You can activate multiple "The Agent of Judgment - Saturns"' effects in the same turn.
*   You can chain "Barrel Behind the Door" to "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn"'s effect.
*   If you chain "Mystical Space Typhoon" to "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn"'s effect and destroy "The Sanctuary in the Sky", "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn"'s effect disappears but it has already been Tributed so it is sent to the Graveyard.
*   If "The Sanctuary in the Sky" is not on the field, you can Tribute "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn" and activate the effect, but the effect is not applied and disappears.
*   If an effect is chained to "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn"'s effect that would increase your opponent's Life Points, so that your opponent's Life Points are higher than yours when its effect resolves, then "The Agent of Judgment - Saturn"'s effect disappears because your Life Points need to be higher than your opponent's when the effect resolves.
*   Damage is calculated and inflicted when the effect resolves, so calculate the exact damage when resolving the effect, including any chained effects that altered the Life Points since activation; if the Life Points have changed since activation, the damage inflicted changes accordingly.

  
## THE AGENT OF WISDOM - MERCURY

*   When it is the END of your opponent's End Phase and you have no hand, then "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury"'s effect activates. So if you activate "Dust Tornado" during your opponent's End Phase, and Set your last card in your hand, and have no cards at the end of the End Phase, "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury"'s effect activates.
*   If your hand was increased during the End Phase by activating "Jar of Greed", and you have a card in your hand at the end of the End Phase, then "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury"'s effect does not activate.
*   If your Standby Phase is skipped then "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury"'s effect disappears.
*   If you have multiple "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury" you can draw multiple times.
*   When the effect of "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury" is negated by "Skill Drain", and you have no hand at the end of your opponent's End Phase, and you destroy "Skill Drain" before your "Standby Phase" (such as with "Mystical Space Typhoon" during your Draw Phase), you CAN draw because "Skill Drain" was destroyed. This is because the "when you have no cards in your hand during your opponent's End Phase" is a condition, not an effect, so it is not negated by "Skill Drain". As long as you can make it so that "Skill Drain" is not negating "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury"'s card-drawing effect by the time the Standby Phase begins, you can draw.
*   When you have "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury" on your side of the field and you have no cards in your hand at the end of your opponent's End Phase, but it is destroyed before your Standby Phase (such as with "Ring of Destruction" during your Draw Phase), then you do NOT draw during your Standby Phase because "The Agent of Wisdom - Mercury" is no longer on the field.

  
## THE BEGINNING OF THE END

*   Removing from play 5 DARK monsters from your Graveyard is a cost to activate this card.

  
## THE BIG MARCH OF ANIMALS

*   “The Big March of Animals” applies its effect at resolution of the card and does not recalculate during the turn. Its effect lasts as long as the affected monsters remain face-up on the field, or until the End Phase.
*   “The Big March of Animals” does not affect monsters Summoned after it resolves.
*   “The Big March of Animals” does not count or affect face-down monsters.
*   This is not an effect that targets. It is applied to all face-up Beast-Type monsters on your side of the field.

  
## THE CALCULATOR

*   The ATK determined by "The Calculator"'s effect is not treated as its original ATK.

  
## THE CREATOR

*   Sending 1 card from your hand to the Graveyard is not a cost to activate the effect of "The Creator". It is part of the effect. So if your opponent chains "Disappear" to remove the targeted monster in your Graveyard from play, the effect of "The Creator" disappears and you do not send 1 card from your hand to the Graveyard.
*   If you use the effect of "The Creator", and then it is flipped face-down then flipped face-up again that same turn, you may use the effect of "The Creator" again.
*   If you activate the effect of "The Creator", and it does not resolve because the opponent chains "Skill Drain", or removes the targeted monster from the Graveyard with "Disappear", you’ve still used the effect. So you cannot activate its effect again that turn (even if you destroy "Skill Drain").
*   To Special Summon "The Creator" with the effect of "The Creator Incarnate", you must Tribute a face-up "The Creator Incarnate" from the field, not from your hand, etc.

  
## THE CREATOR INCARNATE

*   Ignition Effects on monsters cannot be activated while the Effect Monster is face-down. So this face-down monster cannot be Tributed for its own effect.

*   If the effect of "Weather Report" is used to gain an additional Battle Phase, one monster may attack once each Battle Phase.

  
## THE DRAGON'S BEAD

*   When you first activate this card (flip it face-up) you do not have to activate its effect.
*   If "The Dragon’s Bead" is already face-up on the field, you may activate it multiple times in the same chain, but you must discard 1 card from you hand as a cost for each activation.
*   You cannot activate the effect of "The Dragon’s Bead" during the Damage Step.
*   You cannot activate the effect of "The Dragon’s Bead" to negate a Trap Card that has already resolved, such as a "Nightmare Wheel" the opponent activated on a previous turn.
*   You can only activate the effect of this card to negate a Trap Card that targets a face-up Dragon-Type monster, so it cannot negate "Mirror Force", "Waboku", "Torrential Tribute", "Bottomless Trap Hole", etc.

*   The ② Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Tributing this card and the legal Fusion Material Monster(s) on the field is a cost.
    *   This effect does not perform a Fusion Summon, so it can activate while "Non-Fusion Area" applies, but it cannot Special Summon "Evil Hero Dark Gaia" or "Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem".
    *   The Fusion Monster Summoned by this effect cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard / removed from play, since it was not "properly" Fusion Summoned.

  
## THE EMPEROR'S HOLIDAY

*   You can chain "The Emperor’s Holiday" to "Premature Burial" and the effect of "Premature Burial" will be negated and the targeted monster will never leave the Graveyard. If "Premature Burial" is already active when you activate "The Emperor’s Holiday" the equipped monster is unaffected.

  
## THE END OF ANUBIS

*   "The End of Anubis" WILL negate the effects of "Night Assailant" (its second effect), "Aswan Apparition", "Nubian Guard", "Sangan", "Witch of the Black Forest" (even if Tributed to Tribute Summon "The End of Anubis"), "Mystic Tomato"/"Giant Rat"/etc., "Sinister Serpent", "Magician of Faith", "Dark Magician of Chaos"' spell retrieval effect, "Vampire Lord"'s ability to return from the Graveyard, "Dark Necrofear"'s ability to return from the Graveyard, and activation of "Call of the Haunted" or "Premature Burial".
*   "The End of Anubis" WILL NOT negate the Special Summon of "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End", "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning", "Dark Necrofear", "Soul of Purity and Light", etc. (because these involve costs, not effects, and "The End of Anubis" cannot negate paying costs). "The End of Anubis" WILL NOT negate "Strike Ninja"'s effect because removing 2 DARK monsters from the Graveyard is a cost.
*   “The End of Anubis” WILL NOT negate Ignition Effects unless it requires the monster to be in the Graveyard when the Ignition Effect is activated (such as “Amazoness Chain-Master”).
*   "The End of Anubis" WILL NOT negate the effect of "Fiend Comedian", "Fiber Jar", or "Big Burn".You can chain "Call of the Haunted" to your opponent's effect that targets a card in the Graveyard or activates in the Graveyard to Special Summon "The End of Anubis" and negate that effect.
*   "The End of Anubis" negates the Special Summon effect of "Premature Burial" & "Call of the Haunted", but does not negate the effect that destroys the monster when "Premature Burial"/"Call of the Haunted" is destroyed.
*   While "The End of Anubis" is on the field, if you Special Summon "Gilasaurus", your opponent can't Special Summon.If "The End of Anubis" is face-up on the field when a flipped "Spear Cretin" is sent to the Graveyard, then "Spear Cretin"'s effect does not activate. But if "The End of Anubis" was merely on the field when "Spear Cretin" was flipped, but is NOT on the field when "Spear Cretin" is sent to the Graveyard, then "Spear Cretin"'s effect DOES activate when sent to the Graveyard because "The End of Anubis" is no longer on the field to negate it.
*   When "Night Assailant" is discarded to activate the effect of "Tribe-Infecting Virus", and Fiend is named, the effect of "Night Assailant" is activated after "Tribe-Infecting Virus" resolves because "The End of Anubis" is no longer on the field.You cannot send "Desrook Archfiend" to the Graveyard for its effect while "The End of Anubis" is on the field, because the effect of "Desrook Archfiend" targets the destroyed "Terrorking Archfiend" in the Graveyard.

  
## THE EYE OF TRUTH

*   When "The Eye of Truth" is activated in a chain you do not see your opponent’s hand until "The Eye of Truth" resolves. So if "The Eye of Truth" is step 3 in a 5 step chain, steps 5 and 4 will resolve, then "The Eye of Truth" resolves and your opponent reveals his/her hand, then steps 2 and 1 resolve.
*   When "The Eye of Truth" is active and a card such as "Robbin’ Goblin" requires that the opponent discard a card from their hand randomly, the opponent should hide and shuffle his hand, discard a random card, and then reveal their hand again.

  
## THE FIRST SARCOPHAGUS

*   If you have all 3 Sarcophagi on your side of the field, the effect happens automatically; you have no choice in the matter.
*   If you have multiple copies of "The First Sarcophagus", each will have its own "Second Sarcophagus" and "Third Sarcophagus". So if you have 2 of "TheFirst Sarcophagus", you will have 2 of "The Second Sarcophagus" on the field. If you Special Summon "Spirit of the Pharaoh" or if 1 of the Sarcophagi is removed from the field, all Sarcophagi cards are sent to the Graveyard.
*   If 1 of the Sarcophagi is sent to the Graveyard, all are sent simultaneously, not as a chain.

  
## THE FLUTE OF SUMMONING DRAGON

*   You can activate "The Flute of Summoning Dragon" if your opponent controls a face-up "Lord of D." and you do not.
*   You must Special Summon at least 1 Dragon-Type monster or you cannot activate this card.

  
## THE FORCES OF DARKNESS

*   “The Forces of Darkness” targets 2 “Dark World” monsters in the Graveyard. If “Disappear” is chained to remove from play 1 of the targeted monsters, the other 1 is still returned to your hand.

  
## THE FORGIVING MAIDEN

*   "The Forgiving Maiden"'s effect can be activated before or after your monster(s) are destroyed in battle, similar to "Last Will".

  
## THE GRAVEYARD IN THE FOURTH DIMENSION

*   You select 2 monsters in your Graveyard when you activate "The Graveyard in the Fourth Dimension".
*   This card targets 2 cards in the Graveyard.
*   If 1 of the 2 cards targeted by "The Graveyard in the Fourth Dimension" is destroyed or removed from the Graveyard, you still add the remaining 1 card to your Deck and shuffle.

  
## THE HUNTER WITH 7 WEAPONS

*   When you declare an attack with this card against a monster of the selected Type, and the opponent activates "Mirror Wall", the ATK will be halved first at attack declaration, and then increased by 1000 during damage calculation. So the final ATK will be 1500 = (1000/2) + 1000. Similarly, if the opponent activates the effect of "Fairy Box", the ATK of this card will become 1000, because the 1000 point increase occurs after its ATK is reduced to 0.

  
## THE IMMORTAL BUSHI

*   "The Immortal Bushi"'s second effect is an Ignition Effect you activate during your Standby Phase.
*   If an effect chained to "The Immortal Bushi"'s effect places a monster(s) onto your side of the field, "The Immortal Bushi"'s effect disappears.
*   If an effect chained to "The Immortal Bushi"'s effect removes "The Immortal Bushi" from play, its effect disappears.

  
## THE IMMORTAL OF THUNDER

*   The owner of "The Immortal of Thunder" loses 5000 Life Points.
*   If "The Immortal of Thunder" is destroyed while face-down, its owner does not lose 5000 Life Points.
*   If your opponent takes control of your face-down "The Immortal of Thunder" and Flip Summons it, they gain 3000 Life Points. When it is sent to the Graveyard, you lose 5000 Life Points.

  
## THE KICK MAN

*   You select the Spell Card at activation of "The Kick Man"'s effect, so your opponent can chain "Disappear" or "Graverobber" and remove the card you want to equip to him.

  
## THE LADY IN WIGHT

*   If your Level 3 or lower non-Zombie-Type monster is changed to Zombie-Type with "DNA Surgery" while "The Lady in Wight" is face-up on your side of the field, they will remain Zombie-Type monsters.
*   If your Zombie-Type monster's Level is reduced to 3 or less with "Demotion" while "The Lady in Wight" is face-up on your side of the field, its Level remains reduced.

  
## THE LAST WARRIOR FROM ANOTHER PLANET

*   Monsters may still be Set while this card is on the field.
*   This card may be Tributed to Tribute Summon a Level 5 or higher monster.
*   Neither player can activate "Scapegoat", "Magical Hats", "Monster Reborn", etc.
*   If your "Parasite Paracide" in your opponent’s Deck is drawn, it is not Special Summoned. It is instead destroyed and sent to your Graveyard, and no damage is dealt.

  
## THE LAW OF THE NORMAL

*   The "Law of the Normal" includes Tokens.
*   The "Law of the Normal" also destroys all Spell & Trap Cards.
*   The requirement to have 5 face-up Level 2 or lower Normal Monsters only has to be met when "Law of the Normal" is activated, not when it resolves.

  
## THE LEAGUE OF UNIFORM NOMENCLATURE

*   You can activate “The League of Uniform Nomenclature” and Special Summon only 1 copy of the selected monster from your Deck, but the opponent can check your Deck to verify that you do not have a second copy. You can activate “The League of Uniform Nomenclature” targeting a monster like “Right Arm of the Forbidden One” even though it is impossible to have more copies in your Deck (and your opponent can check your Deck to verify).
*   A Normal Monster on the field that has its level lowered to 2 or less by an effect (like “A Legendary Ocean” or “Demotion”) is a proper target for “The League of Uniform Nomenclature”. So you can target “Archfiend Soldier” equipped with “Demotion” and Special Summon 2 copies of “Archfiend Soldier” from your Deck.
*   If you target a “Harpie Lady” on the field equipped with “Demotion”, then you can Special Summon monsters that are treated as having the same name, like “Cyber Harpie Lady” or “Harpie Lady 3”.

  
## THE LEGENDARY FISHERMAN

*   If you take control of your opponent's face-down "The Legendary Fisherman" with "Change of Heart" while "Umi" is face-up on the field, when it is flipped face-up it is immediately returned to your opponent.
*   If you Special Summon "The Legendary Fisherman" with "Premature Burial", when "Premature Burial" is destroyed while "Umi" is face-up on the field "The Legendary Fisherman" is not destroyed.
*   If a face-up "The Legendary Fisherman" is the only monster you control, when your opponent's monsters attack they attack you directly.
*   If a Spell Card is activated that would destroy "Umi" and a face-up "The Legendary Fisherman" simultaneously, "Umi" is destroyed but "The Legendary Fisherman" is not.
*   If your opponent has "Messenger of Peace" or "Swords of Revealing Light" face-up on their side of the field, "The Legendary Fisherman" can attack if "Umi" is face-up on the field. If your opponent has "Toll", you do not pay. If your opponent has "Gravekeeper's Servant", you do not send a card from the top of your Deck to your Graveyard.
*   If "The Legendary Fisherman" is equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" while "Umi" is face-up on the field, the effect of "Ring of Magnetism" is not applied.
*   If your opponent controls a monster equipped with "Ring of Magnetism" and another monster, you can attack the other monster with "The Legendary Fisherman" if "Umi" is face-up on the field.
*   If your opponent has "The Dark Door" face-up on their side of the field, you can attack with one of your monsters and then attack with "The Legendary Fisherman" if "Umi" is face-up on the field.
*   If you control your opponent's "The Legendary Fisherman" with "Snatch Steal" and "Umi" is activated, "The Legendary Fisherman" returns to your opponent. During your opponent's Standby Phases they will still gain 1000 Life Points.

  
## THE LIGHT - HEX-SEALED FUSION

## THE PUPPET MAGIC OF DARK RULER

*   Removing monsters on your side of the field from play is not a cost, so the opponent must decide if they want to chain before you select which monsters are to be removed. If they chain a card that negates the effect of "The Puppet Magic of Dark Ruler" you do not remove any monsters.
*   Face-down monsters may be removed from your side of the field.

  
## THE SECRET OF THE BANDIT

*   This card’s effect targets a monster, so you select the target at the activation of the card. You may select a monster on the opponent’s side of the field. If you target an opponent’s monster, and then take control of it with "Change of Heart" and attack and do Battle Damage to your opponent, they will discard a card. If you target an opponent’s monster, and attack that monster with a weaker monster, causing Battle Damage to yourself, no one will discard a card. The monster targeted by your "The Secret of the Bandit" must deal Battle Damage to the opponent’s Life Points for the effect to activate.
*   If the monster targeted by this card attacks directly and deals Battle Damage, this card’s effect will activate and the opponent must discard 1 card.
*   If you activate multiple copies of this card targeting the same monster, the opponent will still only discard 1 card when the monster deals Battle Damage.

  
## THE SHALLOW GRAVE

*   If "The Shallow Grave" is activated while "Light of Intervention" is active, the monsters are Special Summoned in face-up Defense Position.
*   "The Shallow Grave" cannot be activated if either play has no open Monster Card Zones or if either player does not have a monster in their Graveyard that they can Special Summon.

    *   You can apply this effect in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation. The “Six Samurai” that you destroy instead is sent to the Graveyard in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   If multiple "Six Samurai" would be destroyed at once, you can destroy 1 other "Six Samurai" for each you wish to protect. You cannot only destroy 1 “Six Samurai” to protect all the others.
        *   Example: If "Mirror Force" would destroy 2 of your "Six Samurai" monsters, you must destroy 2 Defense Position "Six Samurai" monsters to save those two
        *   Example: If "Mirror Force" would destroy all your face-up "Six Samurai" monsters, you cannot destroy any of them as substitutes.
    *   If you control 2 “Six Samurai” monsters, and 1 of them equipped with “Legendary Ebon Steed” would be destroyed, the effect of “Legendary Ebon Steed” must be used. You cannot choose to destroy another “Six Samurai” monster instead.

  
## THE SIX SAMURAI - YARIZA  
> ① While you control another "Six Samurai" monster with a different name, this card can attack your opponent directly. ② If this card would be destroyed, you can destroy another "Six Samurai" monster you control instead.

*   The ① Continuous Effect does not activate, it applies on the field.
    *   This effect only applies if you control another "Six Samurai" monster with a different name.
    *   If your other “Six Samurai” is flipped face-down / leaves the field before the Damage Step (of the direct attack), a replay occurs. Do not proceed to the Damage Step for the direct attack.

    *   Your other "Six Samurai" is considered destroyed by this effect, not by battle / card effect.
        *   Example: If “Ring of Destruction” targets a “Six Samurai” monster, and you destroy a different “Six Samurai” monster instead, zero damage will be inflicted by “Ring of Destruction”.
    *   You can apply this effect in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation. The “Six Samurai” that you destroy instead is sent to the Graveyard in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.

## THE SIX SAMURAI - ZANJI  
> ① While you control another "Six Samurai" monster with a different name, destroy any monster this card attacks at the end of the Damage Step.② If this card would be destroyed, you can destroy another "Six Samurai" monster you control instead.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   This effect does not target the monster "Zanji" attacked.
    *   You must control another face-up "Six Samurai" to activate & resolve this effect.
    *   If your other "Six Samurai" is flipped face-down / leaves the field, the monster is not destroyed.
    *   If "The Six Samurai - Zanji" is flipped face-down / leaves the field, the monster is still destroyed.
*   The ② Continuous Effect does not activate, it applies while the destruction occurs.
    *   This effect does not target.
    *   You cannot destroy a face-down "Six Samurai" monster instead.
    *   You can apply this effect when an effect that destroys this card resolves (ex: "Call of the Haunted").
    *   Your other "Six Samurai" is considered destroyed by this effect, not by battle / card effect.
        *   Example: If “Ring of Destruction” targets a “Six Samurai” monster, and you destroy a different “Six Samurai” monster instead, zero damage will be inflicted by “Ring of Destruction”.
    *   You can apply this effect in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation. The “Six Samurai” that you destroy instead is sent to the Graveyard in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.

## THE SPELL ABSORBING LIFE

*   The "Spell Absorbing Life" is like "Ceasefire" except it gives you Life Points instead of damaging your opponent.
*   You can activate "The Spell Absorbing Life" as long as there is at least 1 face-down monster on the field, OR there is at least 1 effect monster on the field (or both).
*   If you control "Fire Princess" and activate "The Spell Absorbing Life", "Fire Princess" inflicts 500 damage no matter how many Life Points you gained from "The Spell Absorbing Life".

  
## THE THING IN THE CRATER

*   You can Special Summon a high-level Normal Monster with "The Thing in the Crater"'s effect, but not a "Special Summon-only" monster.
*   The "Thing in the Crater"'s effect activates even if destroyed face-down and sent to the Graveyard.
*   When you have a monster equipped with "Metalsilver Armor", your opponent can activate "The Thing in the Crater"'s effect because it doesn't target.

  
## THE TRANSMIGRATION PROPHECY

*   This effect targets.
*   You can target 2 cards in your Graveyard, 2 cards in your opponent’s Graveyard or 1 card from each.

  
## THE UNFRIENDLY AMAZON

*   You may Tribute one "The Unfriendly Amazon" to satisfy the maintenance cost of another "The Unfriendly Amazon".
*   "The Unfriendly Amazon" is NOT an Amazoness.

  
## THE UNHAPPY GIRL

*   "The Unhappy Girl"'s effect only applies to "manual" changes. You can still change the monster's position with an effect.
*   If "The Unhappy Girl" is in attack position and her controller uses "Waboku" or "Kuriboh" to take no damage from the attack, the attacking monster still cannot change battle position.
*   If "Tyrant Dragon" or "Hayabusa Knight" attacks "The Unhappy Girl" in attack position, they cannot attack again that turn.
*   If "The Unhappy Girl" is flipped face-down and then flipped face-up again, then her effect is reset and any monsters that battled with her before can change their battle position and attack again.
*   If "The Unhappy Girl" applies her effect to a monster, and "Skill Drain" is then activated and resolves, and "Skill Drain" is then destroyed afterwards, then "The Unhappy Girl"'s effect is re-applied and the monster that battled with her before "Skill Drain" was activated cannot attack or change battle position once again.
*   If your opponent attacks your "The Unhappy Girl" and you use "Magic Cylinder" to negate the attack, then "The Unhappy Girl"'s effect is not applied.
*   If you take control of your opponent's "The Unhappy Girl", her effect on your monsters from previous attacks is still applied.

  
## THE WARRIOR RETURNING ALIVE

*   You may select a Warrior-Type Fusion Monster or Synchro Monster in your Graveyard, but it will be returned to the Extra Deck instead of your hand.
*   You may select any Warrior-Type monster to return to your hand, regardless of its Summoning requirements. So you may select a "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" even if it was never properly Summoned.

  
## THE WHITE STONE OF LEGEND  
> ① When this card is sent to the Graveyard, add 1 "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" from your Deck to your hand.

*   This ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
*   This effect will activate even if no copies of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" remain in your Deck. In this case: your opponent can briefly check your Deck to verify, unless all 3 copies of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" can be accounted for in the Graveyard / field / removed from play (face-up).
*   This effect will activate even when "The White Stone of Legend" was discarded for hand size. In this case: discarding for hand size is the very last action in the End Phase. Only mandatory effects and Counter Trap Cards can be activated beyond this point.
    *   Example: It is Player A's End Phase and they have a Set "Divine Wrath" from a previous turn. Player A discards two copies of "The White Stone of Legend" to bring their hand size down to 6 cards. However, "The White Stone of Legend" has a mandatory Trigger Effect to add a "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" from the Deck to the hand, and Player B controls a "Doomcaliber Knight". Thus, a chain is built with both "The White Stone of Legend"'s effects forming a chain as Chain Links 1 and 2, and "Doomcaliber Knight" Tributing itself as Chain Link 3. Player A activates "Divine Wrath" as Chain Link 4 and discards a card as cost. When resolving the chain, "Divine Wrath" will successfully negate the effect of "Doomcaliber Knight", then both effects of "The White Stone of Legend" will add a copy of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" to Player A's hand (should any remain in the Deck). Once the chain has resolved, no chains may be built (unless mandatory Trigger/Trigger-like Effects were activated) and Player A must once again discard down to their hand limit and the turn ends.

  
## THE WICKED AVATAR

*   If "The Wicked Avatar" is the only face-up monster on the field, its ATK and DEF are 100.

  
## THE WICKED WORM BEAST

*   If you have 7 or more cards in your hand after returning "The Wicked Worm Beast" to your hand, you must discard cards until you have 6 cards.

  
## THE WORLD TREE

*   Placing Flower Counters onto "The World Tree" does not start a Chain.
*   Each of "The World Tree"'s effects target. Each effect is an Ignition Effect.
*   If the Monster Type of a monster on the field is changed to Plant-Type with "DNA Surgery", when it is destroyed, place a Flower Counter onto "The World Tree".
*   If a Plant-Type monster is destroyed by battle, place a Flower Counter onto "The World Tree" when the destroyed monster is sent to the Graveyard. If a Plant-Type monster is destroyed by a card effect, place a Flower Counter onto "The World Tree" after resolving the effect that destroyed the Plant-Type monster.
*   If "The World Tree" is removed from the field after resolving its "Remove 1:" effect, the ATK and DEF increase still lasts until the End Phase.

  
## THEBAN NIGHTMARE

*   If you have only "Kuriboh" in your hand, and no Spell or Trap Cards on the field, and your "Theban Nightmare" battles with a card that has higher ATK/DEF, and you discard "Kuriboh", the ATK of "Theban Nightmare" is increased by 1500 AFTER damage calculation (but "Theban Nightmare" is still destroyed by damage calculation unless an effect like "Waboku" had been activated previously during the turn).

  
## THEINEN THE GREAT SPHINX

*   When you Special Summon "Theinen the Great Sphinx" you do not have to pay the additional 500 Life Points to increase its ATK, you can choose to leave the ATK at 3500. If you do not pay the extra 500 when it is Summoned, you cannot later decide to pay and increase its ATK, it must be done when it is Special Summoned.
*   The effect of Summoning "Theinen the Great Sphinx" is a Trigger Effect, so you may do it during your opponent’s turn if "Andro Sphinx" and "Sphinx Teleia" are destroyed simultaneously.
*   Since Summoning "Theinen the Great Sphinx" is a Spell Speed 1 effect (Trigger Effect), you cannot chain multiple Special Summons of "Theinen the Great Sphinx" to one another. This means you can only Special Summon 1 copy of "Theinen the Great Sphinx" when the conditions are correct. You CANNOT pay 1000 Life Points to Special Summon 2 copies of this card.

  
## THESTALOS THE FIRESTORM MONARCH

*   If you Tribute Summon “Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch” successfully, and your opponent discards a monster like “Oustanding Dog Marron” or “Regenerating Mummy”, you still inflict damage because the monster was discarded to the Graveyard (even though it doesn’t remain there).
*   If “Banisher of the Light” is face-up on the field, no damage is inflicted because the card is not discarded to the Graveyard.
*   This card's effect always activates when Tribute Summoned, even if your opponent has no cards in their hand.

  
## THOUGHT RULER ARCHFIEND  
> ① When this card destroys a monster by battle and sends it to the Graveyard, gain Life Points equal to that monster's original ATK. ② You can pay 1000 Life Points to negate the activation of a Spell or Trap Card that targets 1 Psychic-Type monster, and destroy it.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   The Life Point gain is determined using the destroyed monster's original (printed) ATK, where "?" is treated as 0 ATK.
*   The ② Quick Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This negates the activation (playing face-up) of a Spell / Trap Card, even in the Damage Step.
    *   This cannot negate the activation of Spell Card Effects (ex: "Blaze Accelerator").
    *   The targeted Psychic-Type can be on the field / in the Graveyard / removed from play.
    *   This cannot negate the activation of a Spell / Trap Card that targets more than 1 Psychic-Type, or that simply does not target \[[REF](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Forum:Icarus_Attack_vs._Thought_Ruler)\].

  
## THORN OF MALICE

*   “Thorn of Malice’s” effect that reduces a monster’s ATK & DEF starts a Chain. The ATK & DEF reduction from “Thorn of Malice” lasts as long as the reduced monster is face-up on the field.
*   Effects like “Imperial Order” or “Spell Canceller” will not remove the ATK & DEF reduction.
*   If your monster equipped with “Thorn of Malice” battles a monster with equal ATK while both monsters are in Attack Position, your monster is destroyed but the opponent’s is not, because the effect of “Thorn of Malice” prevents it from being destroyed.
*   If your “Thorn of Malice” is equipped to your opponent’s monster, it will not prevent your monsters from being destroyed in battle with the equipped monster.
*   Your “Thorn of Malice” only prevents the opponent’s monsters from being destroyed by your equipped monster.

  
## THOUSAND ENERGY

*   If you Summon a monster after the resolution of "Thousand Energy", it does not gain the +1000 ATK, but it is still destroyed during the End Phase because that effect is applied to all Level 2 Normal Monsters at that time.
*   If you have "A Legendary Ocean" reducing Level 3's to Level 2, and the effect of "Thousand Energy" is applied, and then "A Legendary Ocean" is destroyed, the levels are returned to Level 3, the ATK/DEF bonus from "Thousand Energy" is lost, and those monsters are not destroyed during the End Phase.
*   A monster affected by "Thousand Energy" is not destroyed if it is face-down during the End Phase.
*   If a monster affected by "Thousand Energy" switches control to your opponent, it is not destroyed during the End Phase.
*   If a monster affected by "Thousand Energy" has its Level changed so that it is not Level 2 during the End Phase, it is not destroyed.
*   If you use "Cost Down" to make a Level 4 monster into a Level 2 monster, Summon it, and use "Thousand Energy", during the End Phase you can choose which effect happens first, so you can restore it to Level 4 first by ending "Cost Down"'s effect, and then it will not be destroyed by the effect of "Thousand Energy".

  
## THOUSAND KNIVES

*   The required card only needs to be face-up on the field. It does not need to be a Monster Card, so if “Dark Magician” is equipped to your “Relinquished”, you can activate “Thousand Knives”.

  
## THOUSAND NEEDLES

*   When the DEF of "Thousand Needles" and the ATK of the attacking monster are the same, the attacking monster is not destroyed by "Thousand Needles"' effect.
*   If the attacking monster is destroyed, it is destroyed by "Thousand Needles"' effect, and it is sent to the Graveyard during the "send monsters to the Graveyard" portion of the Damage Step, at the same time a monster would normally be sent to the Graveyard because of damage calculation.

  
## THOUSAND-EYES RESTRICT

*   If 2 or more "Thousand-Eyes Restrict" are face-up on the field, no monsters can attack.
*   If "Imperial Order" is active, "Thousand-Eyes Restrict"'s ATK and DEF still are still equal to the Monster Card it is equipped with.
*   The Battle Position of monsters can still be changed with card effects.
*   If "Thousand-Eyes Restrict" is equipped with a face-down Monster Card, its ATK and DEF become 0.

  
## THREATENING ROAR

*   You can activate “Threatening Roar” in response to an attack, but the attack has already been declared so it will resolve normally. After that, your opponent cannot attack for the rest of the turn.
*   You cannot activate “Threatening Roar” during your own turn.

  
## THROWSTONE UNIT

*   Use the current ATK and DEF of "Throwstone Unit" and the targeted monster.
*   You can Tribute "Throwstone Unit" for its own effect.

  
## THUNDER CRASH

*   The damage inflicted by "Thunder Crash" is inflicted all at once as 1 lump sum.

  
## THUNDER DRAGON

*   You can discard "Thunder Dragon" to activate its effect even if it would not go to your Graveyard. For example, when "Banisher of the Light" is face-up on the field.
*   If you have your opponent's "Thunder Dragon" in your hand because of "Exchange", you can discard it to activate its effect and search your Deck for up to 2 "Thunder Dragons".
*   You cannot discard "Thunder Dragon" to activate its effect if you do not have any "Thunder Dragon" in your Deck.

  
## THUNDER KING RAI-OH  
> ① Neither player can add cards from their Deck to their hand except by drawing them. ② You can send this face-up card to the Graveyard to negate the Special Summon of 1 of your opponent monsters, and destroy it.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   Cards / Effects that add a card(s) from Deck to hand (ex: "Terraforming", "Elemental Hero Stratos") cannot activate. Mandatory effects (like "Sangan" still activate, starting a chain).
    *   Cards can still be send from the Deck to the Graveyard (by "Foolish Burial") or removed from play (by "Gold Sarcophagus"). The card removed by "Gold Sarcophagus" will be added to the hand.
    *   VS. "Magical Merchant": the mandatory FLIP Effect activates, but the excavated Spell / Trap Card is sent to the Graveyard instead of being added to your hand.
*   The ② Quick Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in the Summon negation timing (like "Black Horn of Heaven").
    *   Sending "Thunder King Rai-Oh" to the Graveyard is a cost. This is not a Tribute. You cannot activate this effect while "Macro Cosmos" is active.
    *   This effect cannot negate a Card Effect (ex: "Debris Dragon") that Special Summons a monster(s).

  
## THUNDER NYAN NYAN

*   You may Summon "Thunder Nyan Nyan" even if you have non-LIGHT monsters on the field, but she will be destroyed.
*   You can have face-down non-LIGHT monsters on your side of the field, "Thunder Nyan Nyan" will not be destroyed by her own effect, but if one of these monsters is flipped face-up, she will be destroyed.
*   When you take control of an opponent’s non-LIGHT monster, and you have "Thunder Nyan Nyan" on the field, she will be destroyed. If your opponent takes control of your "Thunder Nyan Nyan" and he / she controls a non-LIGHT monster, "Thunder Nyan Nyan" will be destroyed.
*   You can Special Summon "Thunder Nyan Nyan" with the effect of "Cyber Jar" but if you Summon another non-LIGHT monster face-up she will be destroyed.
*   "Thunder Nyan Nyan" can be destroyed by her own effect between steps in a chain. For example, the opponent targets your "Thunder Nyan Nyan" with "Snatch Steal". You chain "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Dark Magician" from your Graveyard, a DARK monster. The chain resolves as follows: "Call of the Haunted" resolves, "Thunder Nyan Nyan" is destroyed because there is a DARK monster on the field, "Snatch Steal"’s effect disappears because the target is no longer on the field.
*   If you have a face-up "Thunder Nyan Nyan" and your Set "Penguin Soldier" is attacked, when it is flipped face-up "Thunder Nyan Nyan" will be destroyed, before it can be targeted by the effect of "Penguin Soldier".

  
## THUNDER OF RULER  
> You can only activate this card during your opponent's Standby Phase. Your opponent cannot conduct his/her Battle Phase this turn.

*   When you activate "Thunder of Ruler", since your opponent cannot enter the Battle Phase, your opponent proceeds from Main Phase 1 to the End Phase.
*   VS. "Frozen Soul": The effect of "Frozen Soul" cannot be removed if your opponent cannot conduct their Battle Phase (by "Thunder of Ruler"). If "Thunder of Ruler" and "Frozen Soul" both resolved before your opponent attempted to enter their Battle Phase, then this first Battle Phase cannot be conducted (because of "Thunder of Ruler"), and the lingering effect of "Frozen Soul" will persist until a later turn where your opponent attempts to conduct their Battle Phase \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/144344-frozen-soul-and-thunder-of-ruler/)\].

  
## TIGER DRAGON

*   "Tiger Dragon"'s effect targets the Set Spell or Trap Card(s).
*   If one of the targets is chained, it cannot be destroyed because it is no longer face-down. If 2 face-down Spell or Trap Cards are targeted and only 1 is chained, the remaining face-down Spell or Trap Card is still destroyed.

  
## TIME MACHINE

*   "Time Machine" is activated at the end of the Damage Step, when monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the Graveyard.
*   "Time Machine"'s effect does not target.
*   If a face-down Defense Position monster is attacked and is destroyed by battle, when it is Special Summoned by "Time Machine" it is Special Summoned in face-up Defense Position.
*   If a monster is Special Summoned onto your side of the field with "Time Machine" during your Battle Phase, it may attack again during that Battle Phase.
*   If you activate "Time Machine" when your monster that is being controlled by your opponent is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, when "Time Machine" resolves your monster is Special Summoned onto your opponent's side of the field. If your opponent had taken control of the monster with "Brain Control", etc., it will remain under your opponent's control and will not return to your side of the field in the End Phase.
*   If you destroy your opponent's monster by battle, when it is sent to the Graveyard you can activate "Time Machine". If you do, the monster is Special Summoned onto your opponent's side of the field.
*   If a monster that cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, "Time Machine" cannot be activated.
*   Any Equip Cards that were equipped to the monster when it was destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard are not requipped to the monster when it is Special Summoned.
*   If a Toon Monster like "Toon Mermaid", "Toon Summoned Skull", "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon", or "Manga Ryu-Ran" is destroyed by battle and set to the Graveyard while "Toon World" is not face-up on the field, "Time Machine" cannot be activated.
*   If a monster with an effect that activates when it is destroyed by battle is sent to the Graveyard, like "Sangan" or "Giant Rat", you can chain "Time Machine".
*   If two monsters with equal ATK are both destroyed by the same battle, "Time Machine" cannot be activated.
*   If "Jinzo" is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, you can activate "Time Machine" to Special Summon "Jinzo".
*   If "Embodiment of Apophis" is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, "Time Machine" cannot be activated because "Embodiment of Apophis" is not a monster while in the Graveyard.
*   Cards like "Torrential Tribute" cannot be activated when a monster is Special Summoned by "Time Machine", because cards like "Torrential Tribute" cannot be activated in the Damage Step.
*   When your "Makyura the Destructor" is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, you can activate "Time Machine" from your hand.
*   If a Fusion Monster that was Special Summoned from the Extra Deck by "Metamorphosis" is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, "Time Machine" cannot be activated because the Fusion Monster was not properly Special Summoned and cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard.
*   If your "Sealmaster Meisei" is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard while you control "Talisman of Trap Sealing", you can activate "Time Machine" because "Talisman of Trap Sealing" is destroyed when "Sealmaster Mesei" is removed from the field.

  
## TIME PASSAGE

*   This card targets 1 “Fortune Lady” monster you control.
*   You cannot activate it during the Damage Step.
*   If you activate “Time Passage” targeting your Level 5 “Fortune Lady Dark” and then reduce its Level by 3 for the effect of “Solitaire Magician,” its Level will become 2 during the End Phase (5 + 3 – 3 – 3 = 2)

  
## TIME WIZARD

*   The effect of "Time Wizard" is a Ignition Effect, and therefore can only be activated during your Main Phase 1 or 2.

  
## TIMEATER

*   If your Main Phase 1 is skipped because of "Timeater", you can enter your Battle Phase (even if you have no monsters on the field) and proceed from there to Main Phase 2. If you cannot enter your Battle Phase (due to another card effect such as "Great Long Nose" or "Frozen Soul"), then you must go immediately from Standby Phase to End Phase.
*   If your "Timeater" and your opponent’s monster destroy each other as a result of battle, the effect of "Timeater" is still activated.

  
## TIMIDITY

*   While the effect of "Timidity" is active, all effects of a card which would destroy a Set Spell or Trap Card are negated.
*   While the effect of "Timidity" is active, you cannot destroy a face-down Monster Card equipped to "Relinquished".
*   While the effect of "Timidity" is active, and your opponent activates "Heavy Storm", face-down Spell and Trap Cards are not destroyed but face-up cards will be.

  
## TOKEN THANKSGIVING

*   "Token Thanksgiving" will destroy a Monster Token equipped to "Relinquished".

  
## TOLL

*   Paying Life Points for "Toll" is a cost, so if a player cannot pay the 500 Life Points, they cannot declare an attack. If there are two of this card on the field, a player must pay 1000 Life Points per monster to attack.

  
## TONGUE TWISTER  
> ① If this card was Tribute Summoned, when it is sent from the field to the Graveyard, draw 2 cards and remove this card from play.

*   The ① mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   The effect of "Tongue Twister" will only activate if it was Tribute Summoned. It will not activate if it was Tribute Set \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=826682)\].
    *   The "Draw" and "Remove from Play" portions of this effect are not considered to resolve simultaneously. Resolve this effect sequentially: draw 2, then banish "Tongue Twister" \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=1014618)\].
*   VS. "Necrovalley": While "Necrovalley" is active, "Tongue Twister"'s effect still activates. You will draw 2 cards, and then fail to banish "Tongue Twister" as "Necrovalley" prevents both players from banishing cards in the Graveyard.

  
  
## TOON GEMINI ELF

*   You do not have to have "Toon World" on the field to Summon or Set "Toon Gemini Elf", or to attack with it.
*   The Summon of "Toon Gemini Elf" is a Normal Summon, not a Special Summon (even if you have "Toon World" on the field). So you can Normal Summon it in face-up Attack Position, or Set it in face-down Defense Position.
*   You don't pay Life Points to attack with "Toon Gemini Elf". If your opponent has a Toon Monster on the field, "Toon Gemini Elf" does not have to attack it. However, it will prevent "Toon Gemini Elf" from being able to attack directly.
*   "Toon Gemini Elf" can attack directly, but only while "Toon World" is on your side of the field. (Unlike previous Toon Monsters, which can attack directly even without "Toon World".)

  
## TOON MERMAID

*   This rule applies for "Toon Mermaid", "Toon Summoned Skull", "Manga Ryu-Ran" and "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon": If "Toon World" is returned to a player’s hand, with cards such as "Giant Trunade" these Toon Monsters are not destroyed since "Toon World" was not destroyed.

  
## TOON TABLE OF CONTENTS

*   You cannot activate "Toon Table of Contents" if you do not have any "Toon" Cards, or "Manga Ryu-Ran", in your Deck.

  
## TOON WORLD

*   The 1000 Life Points needs to only be paid once when this card is activated. Paying 1000 Life Points is a cost.

  
## TORAPART

*   The restriction on using “Torapart” as a Synchro Material Monster is not an ‘effect’.
*   If a monster Synchro Summoned with “Torapart” attacks, the opponent cannot activate Trap Cards until after the Damage Step is over.
*   Even cards like “Hero Signal” cannot be activated (which activate when monsters are sent to the Graveyard at the end of the Damage Step).
*   If a monster Synchro Summoned with “Torapart” attacks, and is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard during the Damage Step, the effect of “Torapart” still prevents Trap Cards from being activated until the Damage Step is over (example: if it attacks a face-down “Man-Eater Bug” and is destroyed by that effect).
*   The opponent of the player who used “Torapart” for a Synchro Summon is the one who cannot activate Trap Cards.
*   If you take control of your opponent’s “Torapart” and use it for a Synchro Summon, your opponent cannot activate Trap Cards when that monster attacks.
*   The effect that “Torapart” gives to a Synchro Monster lasts as long as that Synchro Monster remains face-up on the field.
*   If a Synchro Monster that was Summoned with “Torapart” is flipped face-down or leaves the field, the effect of “Torapart” is no longer available, and the opponent can activate Trap Cards when that Synchro Monster attacks.
*   If “Skill Drain” is active while you use “Torapart” to Synchro Summon a monster, “Torapart” is now no longer on the field, so the effect of “Torapart” will be applied. So the opponent cannot activate Trap Cards when that Synchro Monster attacks. This is because the restriction on activating Trap Cards is an effect of “Torapart,” not an effect of the Synchro Monster.
*   If “Torapart’s” effects are being negated by “Forbidden Chalice,” the same rule applies – Trap Cards cannot be activated when the Synchro Monster attacks.

  
## TORNADO WALL

*   "Tornado Wall" may be Set on the field if "Umi" is not on the field, but it cannot be activated. If targeted by "Bait Doll" when face-down and "Umi" is not on the field, it is destroyed.
*   "Tornado Wall" may be activated when "Maiden of the Aqua" or "A Legendary Ocean" is face-up on the field.

  
## TORRENTIAL TRIBUTE

*   "Torrential Tribute" is activated after a monster is Summoned; it is not chained to the Summon. So you cannot activate "Torrential Tribute" when "Jinzo" is Summoned.
*   "Torrential Tribute" can be activated after a monster is Summoned through another card’s effect, such as "Monster Reborn", "Scapegoat", "Cyber Jar" (if Flip Summoned), or "Call of the Haunted".
*   "Torrential Tribute" can be activated after a Flip Summon, but it does not negate the Flip Effect (it is chained to the Flip Effect).
*   "Torrential Tribute" cannot be activated during the Damage Step. This prohibits "Torrential Tribute" from being used against monsters Special Summoned by "Mystic Tomato", "Giant Rat", "Nimble Momonga", "Masked Dragon", and other such cards that Special Summon a monster when destroyed as a result of battle, as well as "Cyber Jar" or "Morphing Jar #2" that is flipped face-up by an attack.
*   When monsters are Special Summoned face-down by an effect, like "The Shallow Grave", "Torrential Tribute" can be activated.

  
## TOTAL DEFENSE SHOGUN

*   "Total Defense Shogun" does not permanently remain in Defense Position. After the turn that "Total Defense Shogun" is Summoned, you can change his battle position as normal. He can also have his battle position changed with card effects like "Stop Defense".
*   You don’t Normal Summon or Flip Summon "Total Defense Shogun" in Defense Position; you Normal Summon or Flip Summon him in face-up Attack Position and he changes to Defense Position. (Or you can Tribute Set him in face-down Defense Position.)
*   You cannot chain to "Total Defense Shogun"’s effect that changes him to Defense Position when Normal Summoned or Flip Summoned. So you cannot chain "Spellbinding Circle", etc.
*   Do not change "Total Defense Shogun" automatically to Defense Position if he is Special Summoned, only if he is Normal Summoned or Flip Summoned.
*   While "Total Defense Shogun" is in Defense Position, he attacks using his ATK but defends with his DEF if he is attacked. If he attacks a monster with higher ATK, but ATK lower than "Total Defense Shogun"’s DEF, "Total Defense Shogun" is still destroyed because the battle is ATK vs. ATK.
*   "Widespread Ruin" and "Mirror Force" cannot destroy "Total Defense Shogun" if he attacks while in Defense Position, and his attack resolves as normal.
*   If "Total Defense Shogun" in Defense Position is your only monster, and attacks, your opponent cannot activate "Mirror Force" because it will have no effect.
*   If "Total Defense Shogun" attacks while in Attack Position, and is changed to Defense Position by "Windstorm of Etaqua", his attack resolves as normal because he can attack while in Defense Position.
*   If "Total Defense Shogun" is a Dragon-Type because of "D. Tribe" or "DNA Surgery", and "Dragon Capture Jar" is in play, "Total Defense Shogun" can still attack.
*   If you select "Total Defense Shogun" with "Dark Spirit of the Silent", "Total Defense Shogun" changes to Attack Position even though he could attack while in Defense Position.

  
## TOTEM DRAGON  
> ① This card can be treated as 2 Tributes for the Tribute Summon of a Dragon-Type monster. ② If this card is in your Graveyard during your Standby Phase and you control no monsters, you can Special Summon this card in Attack Position. You cannot activate this effect if there are any monsters in your Graveyard that are not Dragon-Type. Ⓒ If this card is Special Summoned with this effect, remove it from play when it is removed from the field.

*   The ① Unclassified Effect does not activate.
    *   This effect applies even if this card is face-down (like "Kaiser Sea Horse").
    *   This effect can apply for the Tribute Summon or Tribute Set of a Dragon-Type monster.
    *   The monster must be a Dragon-Type in the hand, not only on the field (by "DNA Surgery").
    *   If "Skill Drain" is active and "Totem Dragon" is face-up, this effect is negated and can't apply.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect does not target. It is not negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   This effect can be used more than once per turn (if initially negated by "Royal Oppression").
    *   This effect cannot activate while "Zombie World" treats your Dragon-Type monsters as Zombie-Type.
*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated.
    *   If a card effect causes this card to leave the field, it is treated as banished by this Condition.
    *   This card cannot be sent to the Graveyard as a cost while this Condition applies.

  
  
## TOWER OF BABEL

*   You place a Spell Counter on this card when the Spell Card resolves, so if "Magic Jammer" is used to negate the Spell Card's activation then you do not place a Spell Counter on this monster. But if "Imperial Order" is chained to the Spell Card, you still place a Spell Counter on this monster because the activation of the Spell Card was not negated. If the Spell Card was a Continuous, Equip, or Field Spell Card, and “Dust Tornado” is chained to its activation and destroys it before it resolves you still place a Spell Counter because the activation of the card was not negated.
*   "Tower of Babel" must be active and face-up on the field before the Spell Card was activated, and when the Spell Card resolves, in order to get a Spell Counter. If you chain "Tower of Babel" to a Spell Card, you do not get a Spell Counter for that Spell Card. If a Quick-Play Spell Card is chained to the activation of "Tower of Babel", you do not get a Spell Counter for that Quick-Play Spell Card.
*   You can move Spell Counters to "Tower of Babel" with "Pitch Black Power Stone", but if the 4th Spell Counter is placed on "Tower of Babel" with "Pitch Black Power Stone" or "Apprentice Magician", "Tower of Babel" is destroyed but no damage is inflicted.
*   "Tower of Babel" cannot blow up in the middle of a chain. If you wind up with 5 Spell Counters on "Tower of Babel" after a chain resolves, the player who caused the 4th Spell Counter to be placed takes the damage. So if you have "Tower of Babel" with 3 Spell Counters, and you activate "Pot of Greed", and your opponent chains "Reload", "Reload" resolves first and places the 4th Spell Counter, and your opponent takes the 3000 damage after the current chain resolves.
*   If "Mystical Space Typhoon" targets "Tower of Babel" with 3 Spell Counters, "Tower of Babel" is destroyed when "Mystical Space Typhoon" resolves, and never gets the 4th Spell Counter, so neither player takes damage.

  
## TOY MAGICIAN

*   If you Set "Toy Magician" in your Spell and Trap Card Zone, you cannot "activate" (flip face-up) it. It remains in your Spell and Trap Card Zone until it is removed by another effect.

  
## TRADE-IN  
> Discard 1 Level 8 monster. Draw 2 cards.

*   Discarding a Level 8 monster is a cost.
*   This card can be activated while "Macro Cosmos" / "Dimensional Fissure" apply their effects.

  
## TRAGEDY

*   You cannot activate "Tragedy" during the Damage Step.
*   You can activate "Tragedy" after an Attack Position monster is changed to Defense Position by a card effect, such as "Enemy Controller" or "Stumbling".
*   "Spear Dragon" changes its battle position at the end of the Damage Step, so you cannot activate "Tragedy" at that time. "Goblin Attack Force" and "Giant Orc" change their battle positions at the end of the Battle Phase, so you can activate "Tragedy" at that time.
*   Missing the Timing: The position change must be the last thing to have happened. If “Zero Gravity” was activated as Chain Link 2 or higher, you would not be able to activate “Tragedy”.

  
## TRAGOEDIA  
> ① You can Special Summon this card from your hand when you take Battle Damage. ② This card gains 600 ATK and DEF for each card in your hand. ③ Once per turn, you can send 1 monster from your hand to the Graveyard to take control of 1 face-up monster your opponent controls with the same Level as the sent monster. ④ Once per turn, you can select 1 monster in your Graveyard; this card's Level becomes the same as that monster's, until the End Phase.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the hand.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation (after Battle Damage is dealt).
    *   This effect can activate if you take Battle Damage when your "Vanity's Fiend" is destroyed by battle.
*   The ② Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.
    *   This card's original ATK is treated as 0 (while negated by "Skill Drain").
    *   This effect constantly re-calculates the ATK/DEF. "Megamorph" / "Shrink" have no effect \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=795807)\].
    *   This effect stops re-calculating the ATK/DEF if changed by "Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind", "Black Garden", etc \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/105886-tragoedia-being-summoned-while-black-garden-is-active/&tab=comments#comment-2112568)\].
*   The ③ Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Sending 1 monster from your hand to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   This effect cannot be activated while "Macro Cosmos" is active.
    *   This targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.
    *   If the target is flipped face-down, it does not change control.
*   The ④ Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect targets a monster in the Graveyard. It is negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   The Level change expires in the End Phase.
    *   The Level change no longer applies if "Tragoedia" is flipped face-down / leaves the field.
    *   VS. "Level Eater": If "Level Eater" lowered the Level of "Tragoedia", then "Tragoedia" changed its Level by its ④ effect, "Tragoedia" becomes the target's Level until the End Phase (the effect of "Level Eater" is no longer applied, even after the effect of "Tragoedia" disappears). However, if "Tragoedia" changes its Level and later "Level Eater" changes it again: during the End Phase, "Tragoedia"'s effect wears off and the change made by "Level Eater" still applies.

  
## TRANSCENDENT WINGS

*   You can send a face-down “Winged Kuriboh” to the Graveyard to activate the effect of “Transcendent Wings”.
*   You can activate “Transcendent Wings” even if there is no “Winged Kuriboh LV10” in your hand or Deck, but you must show your Deck to the opponent if they want to confirm.

  
## TRANSMIGRATION BREAK

*   You cannot activate "Pot of Avarice" while "Transmigration Break" is active.
*   You can activate "Cyberdark Impact!" while "Transmigration Break" is active, but the "Cyberdark" Monsters are removed from play instead of being returned to the Deck.
*   If an effect would return a Fusion Monster in the Graveyard to its owner's hand or Extra Deck, the Fusion Monster is removed from play instead.

  
## TRAP DUSTSHOOT

*   You can select your own card that was taken by your opponent with "Exchange". The card returns to the owner's deck (yours, in this case).

  
## TRAP EATER  
> Ⓒ This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set. Ⓢ This card cannot be Special Summoned except by sending 1 face-up Trap Card your opponent controls to the Graveyard.

*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated.
*   The Ⓢ Summon Effect does not start a Chain.
    *   Sending 1 face-up Trap Card your opponent controls to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   You cannot Summon “Trap Eater” by sending “Macro Cosmos” to the Graveyard
    *   If “Macro Cosmos” & “Imperial Iron Wall” are on the field, you cannot send “Imperial Iron Wall” to the Graveyard to Summon “Trap Eater”, but you can send “Macro Cosmos” to the Graveyard.
    *   While “Skill Drain” negates “Vanity’s Fiend”, you can send "Skill Drain" to Special Summon this card.
    *   If "Royal Decree" negates “Rivalry of Warlords”, you can send “Royal Decree” to Summon this card; but if your other face-up monster is not Fiend-Type then “Trap Eater” will be sent to the Graveyard.
    *   If “Royal Oppression” is sent to the Graveyard, its effect cannot be used to negate the Summon.

  
## TRAP HOLE  
> Activate only when your opponent Normal Summons or Flip Summons a monster with 1000 or more ATK. Destroy that monster.

*   "Trap Hole" can only be activated during the Summon response window after a Normal or Flip Summon.
*   "Trap Hole"targets the monster that was Summoned.
*   The monster summoned must remain face-up on the field in order for "Trap Hole" to destroy that monster.

  
## TRAP JAMMER

*   You can activate "Trap Jammer" during the Damage Step.

  
## TRAP MASTER

*   This card can destroy a Trap Card on either side of the field. So if your opponent has no Trap Cards and no Set Spell or Trap Cards, you must destroy a card on your side of the field. If it is face-down Spell Card you must reveal it to your opponent, and it is not destroyed.

  
## TRAP MONSTERS  
(These rules apply to: "Cyber Shadow Gardna", "Embodiment of Apophis", "Machine King - 3000 B.C.", "Metal Reflect Slime", "Stronghold the Moving Fortress", and "Zoma the Spirit".)

*   Trap Monsters takes up 1 Monster Card Zone and 1 Spell / Trap Card Zone. The physical location of the Trap Monster is the Monster Card Zone, it is not counted as a card in the Spell / Trap Card Zone (even though 1 of those Zones can't be used).
    *   You cannot activate a Trap Monster if you have no unoccupied Monster Card Zones.
*   Control of a Trap Monster can't be changed if the receiving player has no empty Spell / Trap Card Zones.
*   A Trap Monster negated (by “[Jinzo](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Jinzo)”) reverts to being a Trap Cards in the Spell / Trap Card Zone.
    *   A Trap Monster that attacks a Set “[Jinzo](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Jinzo)” reverts to a Trap Card when “[Jinzo](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Jinzo)” if flipped. Damage Calculation is not applied.
    *   Your Trap Monster, stolen by “[Snatch Steal](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Snatch_Steal)”, returns to your Spell / Trap Card Zone when “[Jinzo](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Jinzo)” is Summoned.
    *   If a Trap Monster is activated, "Royal Oppression" can negate its effect to Special Summon itself as a monster, and it will stay in the Spell / Trap Card Zone meaninglessly occupying it \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?p=14930312)\].
*   A Trap Monster that is Set (by "[Book of Moon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Book_of_Moon)") is Set in its corresponding Spell / Trap Card Zone.
    *   If your opponent controls your “[Embodiment of Apophis](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Embodiment_of_Apophis)” as a monster (with “[Snatch Steal](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Snatch_Steal)” / “[Creature Swap](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Creature_Swap)”), and it is flipped face-down, it is Set to your opponent’s Spell / Trap Card Zone.
*   Trap Monsters are affected by cards / effects that affect Trap Cards and / or Monster Cards.
    *   If “[Heavy Storm](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Heavy_Storm)” would destroy a Trap Monster, “[Fake Trap](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fake_Trap)” can activate, but not “[My Body as a Shield](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/My_Body_as_a_Shield)”.
    *   If “[Lightning Vortex](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Lightning_Vortex)” would destroy a Trap Monster,“[My Body as a Shield](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/My_Body_as_a_Shield)” can activate, but not“[Fake Trap](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fake_Trap)”.
    *   If “[Raigeki Break](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Raigeki_Break)” would destroy a Trap Monster, either “[My Body as a Shield](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/My_Body_as_a_Shield)” or “[Fake Trap](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fake_Trap)” can activate.
*   If a Trap Monster is removed from the field, it is removed as a Trap Card.
    *   A Trap Monster sent to the Graveyard is treated as a Trap Card, you can't use "[Time Machine](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Time_Machine)" or “[Return of the Doomed](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Return_of_the_Doomed)”, and it won't trigger “[Last Will](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Last_Will)” or “[Michizure](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Michizure)”.
    *   If "[Caius the Shadow Monarch](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Caius_the_Shadow_Monarch)" banishes "[Zoma the Spirit](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Zoma_the_Spirit)", no damage will be inflicted.
    *   A Trap Monster returned to the hand by “[Penguin Soldier](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Penguin_Soldier)” won't allow “[Major Riot](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Major_Riot)” to be activated.
    *   If a Trap Monster is temporarily banished (by “[Dimensionhole](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dimensionhole)” or “[Interdimensional Matter Transporter](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Interdimensional_Matter_Transporter)”), it returns to the field as a Trap Card and is destroyed immediately by game mechanic. If “[Dimensionhole](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dimensionhole)” was used, you cannot use the Monster Card Zone while the Trap Monster is removed from play, but you can use the Spell & Trap Card Zone it was blocking.
*   As with Monster Cards, a "Trap Monster":
    *   CAN be used as Synchro Material / Fusion Material.
    *   CAN be Tributed for a Tribute / Ritual Summon.
    *   CAN have its Summon responded to by "Torrential Tribute" (if Special Summoned as Chain Link 1).
    *   CAN'T change its battle position the turn it was Summoned (except by card effect).
    *   CAN'T change its battle position after attacking (even if the attack declaration was negated).

  
## TRAP OF BOARD ERASER

*   You cannot activate this card when your opponent does not have a hand.
*   For other rulings, see "Barrel Behind the Door".

  
## TRAP OF THE IMPERIAL TOMB

*   This card targets the 2 cards to be destroyed.
*   You cannot activate this card during the Damage Step.

  
## TRAP REACTOR Y FI

*   This effect does not negate the Trap Card’s effect; it merely destroys the Trap Card. This is a Trigger Effect that activates by chaining it to the activation of the Trap Card. It does not target. This effect can be activated during the Damage Step. If the Trap Card cannot be destroyed when this effect resolves (example: it was destroyed by another card effect already), then you do not inflict 800 damage to your opponent.

  
## TRAP RECLAMATION

*   This card can be chained to a Normal Trap Card or a Continuous Trap Card.
*   This card’s effect is only applied once, the first time the Trap Card it was chained to is sent from the field to the Graveyard for any reason.
*   If the Trap Card that “Trap Reclamation” was chained to is removed from play, or returned to the hand, etc. instead of going to the Graveyard, “Trap Reclamation’s” effect is no longer applied.

  
## TRAP STUN  
> Negate the effects of all other Trap Cards on the field during this turn.

*   This effect does not prevent Trap Cards from being activated.
*   Negate any effect of a Trap Card that activates & resolves on the field.
*   After "Trap Stun" has resolved, if a Trap Card is activated and is removed from the field during the chain (by "[Emergency Provisions](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Emergency_Provisions)"), then the Trap Card will still be negated.

  
## TREE OTTER

*   “Tree Otter’s” effect targets the monster that gets the ATK increase.

  
## TREEBORN FROG  
> ① If this card is in your Graveyard during your Standby Phase and you control no Spell or Trap Cards, you can Special Summon it. This effect cannot be activated if you control a face-up “Treeborn Frog”.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect does not target. It is not negated by "Necrovalley".
    *   This effect can activate multiple times in the same Standby Phase.
    *   You cannot activate two copies of "Treeborn Frog" in the same chain.
    *   If a chained effect puts a Spell / Trap Card on your field, "Treeborn Frog" remains in the Graveyard.

  
## TRIAL OF THE PRINCESSES

*   You cannot activate the effect of “Trial of the Princesses” to Special Summon during your opponent’s turn.

  
## TRIANGLE ECSTASY SPARK

*   You cannot activate "Triangle Ecstasy Spark" if "Harpie Lady Sisters" is not on the field. You can activate it if the opponent controls a "Harpie Lady Sisters". In that case the ATK of the opponent’s "Harpie Lady Sisters" will become 2700, but the opponent still cannot activate Trap Cards, and the effects of Trap Cards on the opponent’s side of the field are negated.
*   If there are multiple copies of "Harpie Lady Sisters" on the field, the ATK of each becomes 2700 until the End Phase.
*   If a Trap Card such as "Waboku" is chained to the activation of "Triangle Ecstasy Spark", the effect of "Waboku" resolves first, and will apply for the rest of the turn regardless of "Triangle Ecstasy Spark". (Just like if "Jinzo" is Summoned after "Waboku" is activated and resolves.)

  
## TRIBE-INFECTING VIRUS

*   You declare the Type when you activate the effect and discard for the cost, not when the effect resolves, so your opponent can chain after you have announced which Type will be destroyed.
*   You CAN declare a Type that exists only on your opponent's side of the field. You CANNOT declare a Type that is not face-up on the field at all.
*   You can use this effect repeatedly as long as you can keep paying the cost.

  
## TRI-BLAZE ACCELERATOR

*   Sending 1 face-up “Blaze Accelerator” on your side of the field to the Graveyard is a cost to activate this card.
*   Sending 1 Pyro-Type monster with 500 or less ATK to the Graveyard is part of this card’s effect. It is not a cost.
*   You cannot activate the effect of this card in the same Chain as this card’s activation. You can only activate the effect after this card’s activation is resolved, and it is face-up on the field.
*   If you activate this card's effect then you, the player, cannot declare an attack so even a monster unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards like "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6" cannot attack.

  
## TRIBUTE DOLL

*   You cannot use "Tribute Doll" to Special Summon a "Special Summon-only" monster like "Dark Necrofear".
*   You can use Monster Tokens as a cost for "Tribute Doll".
*   If you Special Summon a monster with "Tribute Doll", you cannot activate "Diffusion Wave-Motion" on that monster because it cannot attack that turn due to "Tribute Doll"'s effect. However, you can use "Diffusion Wave-Motion" on the monster during your next turn.
*   You can combine "Soul Exchange" with "Tribute Doll" to Tribute your opponent's monster as the cost of "Tribute Doll".

  
## TRIDENT DRAGION

*   The restriction against Special Summoning “Trident Dragion,” except by Synchro Summon, is not an ‘effect’.
*   The effect of “Trident Dragion” that destroys cards is a Trigger Effect that targets.
*   The gain of additional attacks is resolved as part of this effect.
*   If 1 of the targeted cards is destroyed in a Chain before the effect of “Trident Dragion” resolves, you still destroy the remaining card, so “Trident Dragion” still gains 1 additional attack.
*   If “Trident Dragion” gains additional attacks, and then “Skill Drain” is activated later, it does not remove the additional attacks from “Trident Dragion.” “Trident Dragion” cannot be Special Summoned by “Wicked Rebirth” or similar cards, because they do not Synchro Summon a monster.

  
## TRIGGERED SUMMON

*   You can choose not to Summon a monster when this card resolves.
*   You can activate this card if you have no Level 4 or lower monster in your hand.
*   You cannot activate this card if neither player has an open Monster Card Zone. You can activate this card if only 1 player has an open Monster Card Zone.
*   When this card resolves, the Turn Player Summons first, but both players’ monsters are considered to have been Summoned at the same time.
*   You can activate this card when you Special Summon "Lava Golem" to your opponent's side of the field.

  
## TROJAN BLAST

*   You can activate “Trojan Blast” when a face-down monster shifts, such as with “Creature Swap”. But no damage will be inflicted because it was face-down.
*   You cannot activate “Trojan Blast” when a monster shifts control to become an Equip Card. So you cannot activate “Trojan Blast” when “Relinquished” or “Allure Queen” equips itself with your monster.
*   “Trojan Blast” is not a targeting effect. Select the monster when “Trojan Blast” resolves.

  
## TROJAN GLADIATOR BEAST

*   “Bottomless Trap Hole” cannot be used in response to “Trojan Gladiator Beast” as it misses the timing, since the last thing that happened was that the player drew a card.

  
## TRUCKROID

*   If your opponent controls one of your monsters and you destroy that monster in battle with “Truckroid”, the destroyed monster will still be equipped to “Truckroid”.

  
## TSUKUYOMI

*   You can select "Tsukuyomi" itself as the target of "Tsukuyomi"'s effect, but not when "Tsukuyomi" was flipped face-up by an attack and destroyed by damage calculation.

  
## TUNER CAPTURE

*   “Tuner Capture” targets the Tuner in the opponent’s Graveyard. You cannot use “Tuner Capture” on monsters that were treated as Tuners because of “Lightwave Tuning” or similar effects, as they are no longer considered Tuners in the Graveyard.

  
## TUNER’S SCHEME

*   This card continuously targets the Synchro Monster.If you take control of a Synchro Monster with “Tuner’s Scheme” and then the monster is flipped face-down, you keep control of it, but it is no longer targeted by “Tuner’s Scheme.”
*   If your opponent uses “Brain Control” to take control of the monster you took control of with “Tuner’s Scheme” and the monster is destroyed, “Tuner’s Scheme” is destroyed as well.
*   If “Tuner’s Scheme” is removed from the field, its effect no longer applies and your opponent regains control of the Synchro Monster.

  
## TUNINGWARE  
> ① If this card is used for a Synchro Summon, you can treat it as a Level 2 monster. ② If this card is sent to the Graveyard for a Synchro Summon, draw 1 card.

*   The ① Unclassified Effect does not activate. It applies while this card is face-up on the field
    *   Applying this effect does not start a chain.
    *   This effect can be negated (by "Debris Dragon" / "Junk Synchron" / "Skill Drain").
    *   If "Tuningware"'s Level is changed, it can still apply this effect.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard.
    *   This effect can activate when "Eccentric Boy" uses this card as Synchro Material from the hand.
    *   This effect cannot activate if the Synchro Summon is negated (by "Black Horn of Heaven").

  
## TURBO BOOSTER

*   "Turbo Booster" can only be Special Summoned by its effect during your own Main Phases.
*   "Turbo Booster"'s second effect is an Ignition Effect that you can activate during your Main Phase 2. Tributing "Turbo Booster" is a cost. This effect targets your opponent's monster.
*   If you Special Summon "Turbo Booster" during your Main Phase 2 you can still activate its second effect.

  
## TURBO CANNON

*   This is an Ignition effect.
*   This effect targets 1 face-up monster.
    *   If you target a monster with the effect of “Turbo Cannon” and control of the monster shifts to you as a result of a Chained effect, you will take damage equal to half of the target monster’s ATK.
    *   If the monster targeted by “Turbo Cannon” is flipped face-down, the effect of “Turbo Cannon” will not be applied. The damage dealt by this effect is half of the current ATK of the monster on the field.
    *   Destroying the target monster and inflicting damage are considered to occur at the same time.

  
## TURBO ROCKET

*   If “Turbo Rocket” attacks “Injection Fairy Lily” and the controller of “Injection Fairy Lily” pays 2000 Life Points to activate its effect, the damage dealt by the effect of “Turbo Rocket” will be 200 because it looks at the ATK of the monster after damage calculation is over.

  
## TURBO SYNCHRON  
① When this card declares an attack, you can change the attack target to Defense Position. ② When you take Battle Damage while this card is attacking, you can Special Summon 1 monster from your hand with ATK equal to or less than the Battle Damage you took.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates at the Start of the Battle Step - Attack Declaration (like "Mirror Force").
    *   This does not target the opponent's monster.
    *   If "Turbo Synchron" attacks an Attack Position "Berserk Gorilla" and activates its effect, "Berserk Gorilla" is shifted to Defense Position and destroyed. A replay occurs but this effect cannot be activated again, since as the Attack Declaration timing has concluded.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation (after Battle Damage is dealt).
    *   "Turbo Synchron" must be face-up on the field (not destroyed by battle) to activate this effect.
    *   This effect cannot activate if "0" Battle Damage was dealt while "Waboku" applies.
    *   If the Special Summoned monster has a Trigger Effects (ex: "Red Gadget"), it can activate and start another manual chain in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation.
    *   Continuous Effects of the Special Summoned monster take effect immediately.

  
## TURBO WARRIOR

*   "Turbo Warrior"'s first effect activates when the attack is declared. If it attacks a face-down Synchro Monster, "Turbo Warrior"'s effect does not activate.
*   "Turbo Warrior"'s effects do not target.
*   If "Turbo Warrior" attacks a Level 6 or higher Synchro Monster and an effect is chained that changes the attack target to a different monster, the new attack target monster has its ATK halved instead.

  
## TURRET WARRIOR

*   You can Tribute a face-down Warrior for “Turret Warrior”, and it will still gain the appropriate ATK. You can Tribute a Warrior-Type Token monster to Special Summon “Turret Warrior”, or a card like “Embodiment of Apophis” that is currently a Warrior.
*   “Turret Warrior” still gains the appropriate ATK in these cases. If you Tribute a Warrior with variable ATK, like “Evil Hero Dark Gaia”, the original ATK is treated as 0 so “Turret Warrior” gains no bonus ATK.
*   Tributing a Warrior to Special Summon “Turret Warrior” is not a cost; both the Tribute and the ATK increase are part of the effect.

  
## TUTAN MASK

*   You cannot activate "Tutan Mask" to negate a Spell or Trap Card that targets a Zombie-Type monster in the Graveyard or Deck (such as "Monster Reborn").
*   You cannot use "Tutan Mask" to negate a Spell or Trap Card that targets a face-down Zombie-Type monster.

  
## TWILIGHT ROSE KNIGHT

*   This effect does not target.

  
## TWIN SWORDS OF FLASHING LIGHT - TRYCE

*   Sending a card to the Graveyard is a cost.
*   If the first attack of a monster equipped with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce" is negated by "Magic Cylinder", the monster can still perform the second attack.
*   When you declare the second attack of a monster equipped with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce", and the "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce" is destroyed during the Battle Step with "Mystical Space Typhoon", the monster is no longer capable of performing the second attack, and a replay occurs.
*   If a monster that normally attacks twice like "Hayabusa Knight", "Gray Wing", or "Tyrant Dragon" is equipped with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce", it doesn't get a third attack.
*   You can equip "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce" to "Injection Fairy Lily" and you can use her effect for each attack.
*   If "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce" is equipped to a monster affected by "Diffusion Wave Motion", it can only attack twice.
*   If "Dark Blade" equipped with "Kiryu" is also equipped with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce", and attacks twice, and "Kiryu" is then "detached" with "Combination Attack", "Dark Blade" can attack 1 more time (not 2 more times).
*   If "Airknight Parshath" is equipped with "Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce" and attacks twice, you can draw twice.

  
## TWIN-BARREL DRAGON

*   "Twin-Barrel Dragon’s" effect targets 1 card your opponent controls.

  
## TWIN-HEADED BEHEMOTH

*   The effect of this card is only activated when it is "destroyed". It will not activate if Tributed, discarded, or sent to the Graveyard.
*   When "Twin-Headed Behemoth" is Special Summoned by its own effect you can activate "Card of Safe Return" and draw 1 card.
*   When "Twin-Headed Behemoth" is Special Summoned by its own effect and is equipped with "Megamorph" it is the original ATK/DEF that is doubled or halved. (ATK 3000 / DEF 2400 if doubled, ATK 750 / DEF 600 if halved)
*   The opponent cannot activate "Bottomless Trap Hole" when "Twin-Headed Behemoth" is Special Summoned by its own effect, because its ATK is already changed to 1000 at the time of Summoning.
*   The condition that this card’s effect can only be used once per Duel cannot be reset. So if it is Special Summoned by its own effect and later removed from play, flipped face-down, returned to your hand, destroyed and Special Summoned, or shuffled into your Deck, you STILL cannot use its effect a second time.
*   If removed from play temporarily by the effect of "Dimensionhole" or "Interdimensional Matter Transporter", it will return with its original ATK/DEF, but its condition is not reset.
*   If flipped face-down, and then Flip Summoned, it will have its original ATK/DEF, but its condition is not reset.
*   If equipped to "Relinquished" and destroyed, you can use the effect of this card and it will be Special Summoned on your side of the field with ATK/DEF of 1000 points. (If you have not already used this effect once.)
*   If this card is controlled by your opponent and is destroyed, it will be Special Summoned on your side of the field with ATK/DEF of 1000 points. (If you have not already used this effect once.)
*   If "Twin-Headed Behemoth" would be Special Summoned by its own effect, but your Monster Card Zones are full, or the effect of "Scapegoat" prevents you from Summoning, it still considered that its effect was activated, and you cannot use it again in the current Duel.
*   You may still Special Summon "Twin-Headed Behemoth" with the effect of "Monster Reborn", etc. after its effect has been used once.
*   If you activate "Monster Reborn" to Special Summon "Twin-Headed Behemoth" in the turn it was destroyed, its effect has not yet been used, and it will activate the next time it is destroyed.

  
## TWIN-SHIELD DEFENDER

*   "Twin-Shield Defender"'s effect targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.
*   "Twin-Shield Defender" halves the current ATK of the targeted monster, including any gains and/or losses from effects.
    *   Example 1: "Sangan" equipped with "Axe of Despair" has 2000 ATK. If its ATK is halved by "Twin-Shield Defender" it will have 1000 ATK.
    *   Example 2: "Sangan"'s original ATK is halved by "Shrink" to 500 ATK. If its ATK is halved by "Twin-Shield Defender", it will have 250 ATK.
*   If "Rush Recklessly" is activated after "Twin-Shield Defender"'s effect resolves, the ATK gained from "Rush Recklessly" is not halved.
*   If "Shrink" or "Megamorph" is activated after "Twin-Shield Defender"'s effect resolves, "Twin-Shield Defender"'s effect disappears.
    *   Example 1: If "Sangan"'s ATK is halved by "Twin-Shield Defender" to 500 ATK and afterwards its original ATK is halved by "Shrink", it will have 500 ATK.
    *   Example 2: If "Sangan"'s ATK is halved by "Twin-Shield Defender" to 500 ATK and afterwards it is equipped with "Megamorph", it will have 500 ATK or 2000 ATK (depending on Life Points).

  
## TWIN-SWORD MARAUDER

*   If the attacked monster was originally in Attack Position, but is changed to Defense Position before damage calculation, the effect of “Twin-Sword Marauder” will activate.

  
## TWO THOUSAND NEEDLES

*   You destroy the attacking monster with "Two Thousand Needles"' effect at the end of the Damage Step.

  
## TWO-MAN CELL BATTLE

*   You can chain to the Special Summoning effect of "Two-Man Cell Battle".

  
## TWO-PRONGED ATTACK

*   "Two-Pronged Attack" targets 2 monsters you control and 1 monster your opponent controls. Destroying 2 of your monsters is not a cost.

  
## TYPE ZERO MAGIC CRUSHER

*   Discarding 1 Spell Card is a cost to activate "Type Zero Magic Crusher"'s Ignition-like effect.

  
## TYRANNO INFINITY

*   The ATK of “Tyranno Infinity” changes according to the current number of your Dinosaur removed from play.
*   Remember that monsters removed from play go to the “removed zone” of the owner, even if controlled by the opponent, and even if they will return to the opponent’s side of the field later because of “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” or “Dimensionhole”.
*   If “Tyranno Infinity” is equipped with “Megamorph” and the number of removed from play Dinosaurs changes, first change the original ATK of “Tyranno Infinity”, and then double or halve that value to calculate its current ATK for “Megamorph”.

  
## TYRANT DRAGON

*   The first sentence of this card’s text means that after you complete an attack with "Tyrant Dragon", if there is still a monster on the opponent’s side of the field, "Tyrant Dragon" can immediately attack again. You cannot attack with another monster in between, and then attack a second time with "Tyrant Dragon." If there are no monsters on your opponent’s side of the field after "Tyrant Dragon"’s first attack, "Tyrant Dragon" does not gain a second attack.
*   "Tyrant Dragon" cannot attack more than twice, even if there is another monster remaining on your opponent’s side of the field after the second attack.
*   "Tyrant Dragon"'s first attack does not have to be the first attack of the Battle Phase. You may attack with another monster, then with "Tyrant Dragon", then again with "Tyrant Dragon" -- if the opponent still controls a monster.
*   The opponent may activate Trap Cards that target "Tyrant Dragon", but their effects will be negated and the cards destroyed.
*   When you Summon "Tyrant Dragon", the opponent can activate "Torrential Tribute" or "Bottomless Trap Hole" and destroy "Tyrant Dragon" because neither of these Trap Cards target. (However, "Trap Hole" does target and its effect will disappear if activated.)
*   When you attack with "Tyrant Dragon" the opponent can activate "Mirror Force" and all your Attack Position monsters, including "Tyrant Dragon", will be destroyed. This is because "Mirror Force" does not target.
*   You may activate "Last Turn" and select your "Tyrant Dragon" as the monster to keep, because "Last Turn" does not target.
*   When you Summon "Tyrant Dragon" the opponent can activate "Solemn Judgment" or "Horn of Heaven" to negate the Summon.
*   You can activate "Call of the Haunted" to Special Summon "Tyrant Dragon". After it resolves, "Call of the Haunted" will be destroyed and "Tyrant Dragon" will remain on the field. You must still Tribute a Dragon-Type monster to perform this Special Summon, in accordance with the text of "Tyrant Dragon".
*   If you activate "Monster Reborn" to Special Summon your opponent’s "Tyrant Dragon" in your opponent’s Graveyard, you must still Tribute a Dragon-Type monster from your side of the field. If you do not control a Dragon-Type monster, you cannot select "Tyrant Dragon" as a target for "Monster Reborn".
*   You Tribute a Dragon-Type monster when the effect that Special Summons "Tyrant Dragon" resolves, not when it activates. So if you activate "Monster Reborn" and target "Tyrant Dragon" and your opponent chains "Imperial Order" and negates "Monster Reborn" you do not Tribute a Dragon-Type monster. Likewise, if you control 1 Dragon-Type monster on the field, and activate "Monster Reborn", and your opponent chains "Ring of Destruction" to destroy your only Dragon-Type monster, you are unable to Tribute a Dragon-Type monster when "Monster Reborn" resolves and its effect disappears.
*   You may Tribute a face-down Dragon-Type monster when you Special Summon "Tyrant Dragon".
*   Even if "Tyrant Dragon" was destroyed by "Dark Balter the Terrible" or some other monster that negated the effect of "Tyrant Dragon", you must still Tribute a Dragon-Type monster if you Special Summon it because this is a condition, not an effect.

  
## TYTANNIAL, PRINCESS OF CAMELLIAS  
> ① You can Tribute 1 face-up Plant-Type monster you control to negate the activation of a Spell, Trap, or Effect Monster's effect that targets a card(s) on the field and destroy it.

*   The ① Quick Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Tributing 1 face-up Plant-Type monster (even itself) you control is a cost.
    *   This effect negates the activation of a Card / Effect, even in the Damage Step.
    *   This effect negates the activated effect Spell / Trap Cards (ex: "Blaze Accelerator").
    *   This effect cannot activate if a Card / Effect does not target (ex: "Black Rose Dragon").
    *   During the Damage Step, "Tytannial, Princess of Camellias" can Tribute a Plant-Type monster that is attacking or being attacked to activate its effect. If the Plant-Type monster that is attacking or being attacked is Tributed before damage calculation, damage calculation does not occur. If the Plant-Type monster is destroyed by the battle, it cannot be Tributed to activate "Tytannial, Princess of Camellias'" effect.




## UFO TURTLE

*   If you attack with your "UFO Turtle" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you may attack with the monster Special Summoned by "UFO Turtle" before entering Main Phase 2.
*   If your opponent controls your "UFO Turtle" and it is destroyed as a result of battle, you get the effect of "UFO Turtle" NOT your opponent.
*   Since the Special Summoning occurs during the Damage Step, "Torrential Tribute", etc. cannot be used.

  
## UFOROID

*   If “UFOroid” attacks an Attack Position “Pyramid Turtle”, first the turn player decides whether to activate the effect of “UFOroid” or not, and if he does, it will be Chain Link 1. If he doesn’t, the opponent has a chance to activate “Pyramid Turtle’s” effect and be Chain Link 1. If he does, it is too late for the turn player to decide to activate “UFOroid’s” effect.
*   If you do not choose to Special Summon a Machine, this card’s effect will not activate or start a chain.

  
## UFOROID FIGHTER

*   If “UFOroid Fighter” is Special Summoned with “Cyber-Stein” or “Metamorphosis”, its original ATK & DEF will be zero.
*   If “UFOroid Fighter” is Special Summoned with “Power Bond”, first apply the effect of “UFOroid Fighter” to determine its original ATK & DEF, and then apply the ATK increase of “Power Bond”.
*   If “UFOroid Fighter” is on the field, and then “Skill Drain” is activated, the original ATK & DEF will be zero, and will remain zero even if “Skill Drain” is destroyed or negated.
*   You can Special Summon “UFOroid Fighter” using “UFOroid” and a monster that was changed to Warrior-Type with “DNA Surgery”, etc.

  
## ULTIMATE ANCIENT GEAR GOLEM  
> Ⓒ This monster cannot be Special Summoned except by Fusion Summon. ① During battle between this attacking card and a Defense Position monster whose DEF is lower than the ATK of this card, inflict the difference as Battle Damage to your opponent. ② If this card attacks, your opponent cannot activate Spell or Trap Cards until the end of the Damage Step. ③ If this card is destroyed, you can Special Summon 1 "Ancient Gear Golem" from your Graveyard, ignoring the Summoning conditions.

*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated.
    *   This card cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard / removed from play.
    *   This card cannot be Special Summoned by "Summoner of Illusions".
*   The ① Continuous Effect applies so long as this card is face-up on the field.
    *   Inflicting piercing Battle Damage does not start a chain.
*   The ② Continuous Effect starts to apply at the Start of the Battle Step - Attack Declaration.
    *   This effect applies until the end of Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   This effect stops applying if “Ancient Gear Golem” attacks and is _destroyed by battle_ (in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation) or by an effect during the Damage Step.
    *   Face-down Spell / Trap Cards cannot be activated (flipped face-up or played from the hand).
    *   Continuous-like Effects of Spell / Trap Cards still apply.
    *   The effects of face-up Spell / Trap Cards can still activate (ex: “Ultimate Offering” or “Skull Lair”).
*   The ③ optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the Graveyard / removed from play.
    *   If this card is destroyed in battle, this effect activates in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.
    *   If your opponent controls your this card when it is destroyed, you can still activate this effect.
    *   This "_If... you can..._" effect cannot miss the timing, even if it is destroyed as Chain Link 2+.

  
## ULTIMATE BASEBALL KID

*   "Ultimate Baseball Kid"’s ATK increase includes FIRE monsters on your opponent’s side of the field.
*   You can only send FIRE monsters on your side of the field to the Graveyard for "Ultimate Baseball Kid’s" second effect, not monsters in the hand, Deck, Side Deck, Extra Deck, Removed Zone, or on your opponent’s side of the field.
*   You can send monsters to the Graveyard for "Ultimate Baseball Kid"’s second effect that have been changed to FIRE Attribute by "DNA Transplant" or "Scroll of Bewitchment".
*   You cannot send a face-down FIRE monster to the Graveyard to activate "Ultimate Baseball Kid’s effect".
*   If 2 "Ultimate Baseball Kids" are on the field, and no other FIRE monsters, each of them has an ATK of 1500.

  
## ULTIMATE INSECT LV1

*   The "you" in "on your side of the field" is the current controller’s field, so as long as "Ultimate Insect LV1" is face-up, it is always "face-up on your side of the field".
*   "Ultimate Insect LV1"’s 2nd sentence is a Ignition Effect that is activated by sending "Ultimate Insect LV1" to the Graveyard as a cost. You can chain to this effect.
*   You cannot activate the effect of "Ultimate Insect LV1" the same turn it is flipped face-up, including by "Book of Taiyou", etc.

  
## ULTIMATE INSECT LV3

*   The effect of "Ultimate Insect LV3" that reduces ATK by 300 points is a Continuous Effect that is applied as long as the monster remains face-up on the field and is applied as soon as it is face-up on the field.

  
## ULTIMATE INSECT LV5

*   If this monster is Special Summoned by the effect of “Ultimate Insect LV 3”, but is then flipped face-down, or removed from play with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” or “Dimensionhole”, its effect is reset, so even if flipped face-up again, it will no longer decrease the ATK of the opponent’s monsters.
*   You can Special Summon “Ultimate Insect LV5” with the effect of “Ultimate Insect LV3” even if that “Ultimate Insect LV3” was not Special Summoned by the effect of “Ultimate Insect LV1”.

  
## ULTIMATE INSECT LV7

*   If “Ultimate Insect LV7” is Summoned by the effect of “Ultimate Insect LV5”, but is then flipped face-down and then face-up again, its effect is reset and will no longer be applied.
*   If you have 2 copies of “Ultimate Insect LV7” each Summoned by the effect of “Ultimate Insect LV5”, then the ATK and DEF of your opponent’s monsters are reduced by 1400 points.
*   “All your opponent’s monsters” means the monsters on your opponent’s side of the field.

  
## ULTIMATE OBEDIENT FIEND  
If you control "Ultimate Obedient Fiend" and have no hand and no other monsters, but you have Spell or Trap Cards on the field, "Ultimate Obedient Fiend" cannot attack.  
  
## ULTIMATE OFFERING  
> ①_ _You can pay 500 Life Points to Normal Summon or Set 1 extra monster. You can only activate this effect during your Main Phase or your opponent's Battle Phase.

    *   The Normal / Tribute Summon performed CANNOT be negated by "Solemn Judgment" \[[REF](https://www.edisonformat.com/home/rules-update-when-not-immediately-after-this-effect-resolves)\].
    *   If this effect resolves as Chain Link 1, "Torrential Tribute" can activate \[[REF](https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=26817)\].
    *   This effect can be activated during your Main Phase or your opponent’s Battle Phase.
    *   If this card is face-up, you can activate this effect multiple times in the same Chain. If you cannot perform every Normal Summon / Set when resolving the chain: reveal your hand to verify.

  
## ULTIMATE TYRANNO

*   If you have 2 or more “Ultimate Tyranno” in Attack Position at the start of your Battle Phase, you choose 1 and it attacks all of your opponent’s monsters first.
*   Either player may activate effects during the Battle Phase before "Ultimate Tyranno" attacks, as well as during, or in between its attacks.
*   If "Ultimate Tyranno" attacks and destroys an opponent's "Mystic Tomato" and they use its effect to Special Summon another monster, then "Ultimate Tyranno" must also attack the newly Summoned monster.

  
## ULTRA EVOLUTION PILL

*   You can Tribute a face-down Reptile-Type monster when you activate "Ultra Evolution Pill".

  
## UMBRAL SOUL

*   This card’s effect will destroy “Elemental Mistress Doriado”.

## UNIFROG  
> ① This card can attack your opponent directly. ② When this card successfully attacks directly, if you control a "Frog" monster other than "Frog the Jam" or "Unifrog", you can destroy 1 Spell or Trap your opponent controls.

*   The ① Continuous Effect applies on the field.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   If no Battle Damage is dealt (due to "Waboku"), this effect can't activate.
    *   This effect activates in Substep 5 - After Damage Calculation (like "Spirit Reaper") \[[REF](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Forum:Question_about_unifrog_and_batteryman...)\].
    *   This effect targets 1 Spell / Trap Card (including equipped monsters) your opponent controls \[[REF](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Forum:Unifrog_%3F)\].

  
## UNION RIDER

*   When you use "Union Rider"'s effect to equip a Union Monster to it, because the Union Monster was not equipped to "Union Rider" by the Union Monster's effect, the bonuses of the Union Monster are not applied, including the "If the monster that this card is equipped to is destroyed in battle, this card is destroyed instead." effect.
*   You can only use the effect of "Union Rider" during your Main Phase 1 or 2.
*   If you use "Combination Attack" or "Formation Union" on your "Union Rider" equipped with your opponent's Union Monster, the Union Monster is Special Summoned onto your (the controller of "Union Rider"'s) side of the field.
*   If you equip your "Union Rider" with your opponent's Union Monster, and attack with "Union Rider", then use "Combination Attack", you will then control both the "Union Rider" and the Union Monster on your side of the field, and both may attack (again) that turn.
*   The Union Monster you equip to your "Union Rider" is actually placed in your Spell & Trap Card Zone, so it counts for you for "Mage Power", etc.
*   You must have a Spell & Trap Card Zone space vacant to activate your "Union Rider"'s effect.

  
## UNLEASH YOUR POWER!

*   Gemini Monsters you control that are already being treated as Effect Monsters when you activate "Unleash Your Power!" are unaffected by "Unleash Your Power!" and are not Set during the End Phase.

  
## UNSTABLE EVOLUTION

*   "Unstable Evolution" changes the equipped monster's original ATK. If the equipped monster is targeted by "Shrink", its original ATK determined by "Unstable Evolution" is halved.
*   When determining the equipped monster's ATK, apply the effect of "Unstable Evolution" and then apply any other ATK gains and losses.
*   If the equipped monster gains 700 ATK with "Rush Recklessly" and afterwards "Unstable Evolution" is removed from the field or negated, etc., the monster's original ATK returns to normal and "Rush Recklessly" is reapplied.
*   If the equipped monster is also equipped with "Megamorph", first determine its new original ATK due to "Unstable Evolution" and then halve or double it with "Megamorph".
*   If "Unstable Evolution" is equipped to "King of the Skull Servants", "King of the Skull Servant"'s original ATK becomes the value determined by "Unstable Evolution". When "Unstable Evolution" is negated or removed from the field, "King of the Skull Servant"'s original ATK is determined by its effect.
*   If "Unstable Evolution" is equipped to "Megarock Dragon", its original ATK becomes the value determined by "Unstable Evolution". When "Unstable Evolution" is negated or removed from the field, "Megarock Dragon"'s original ATK is determined by its own effect.
*   If "Unstable Evolution" is equipped to a "Fusilier Dragon, the Dual-Mode Beast" that was Normal Summoned or Set without Tributes, its original ATK is determined by "Unstable Evolution". When "Unstable Evolution" is negated or removed from the field, "Fusilier Dragon, the Dual-Mode Beast"'s ATK becomes halved to 1400.
*   The monster equipped with "Unstable Evolution" is not destroyed by "Overworked", because "Unstable Evolution" changes the monster original ATK to a new value. The monster will be destroyed if another effect increases its ATK.

  
## URGENT SYNTHESIS

*   Returning 1 “Iron Core of Koa’ki Meiru” to the Deck is a cost to activate “Urgent Synthesis.” The effect does not target. You cannot activate “Urgent Synthesis” while “Transmigration Break” is active, as you cannot pay the cost to return “Iron Core of Koa’ki Meiru” to the Deck.

  
## URGENT TUNING  
> Activate only during the Battle Phase. Synchro Summon 1 Synchro Monster. (Send the appropriate Synchro Material Monsters to the Graveyard.)

*   This card does not target.
*   This card cannot be activated during the Damage Step.
*   The Synchro Summon occurs when this effect resolves, it does not occur "_immediately after this effect resolves._" as seen in the most recent erratum.
*   "Solemn Judgment" cannot negate the Synchro Summon performed when this effect resolves \[[REF](https://www.edisonformat.com/home/rules-update-when-not-immediately-after-this-effect-resolves)\].
*   If the number of monsters you control changes due to an effect chained to “Urgent Tuning”, and you do not have a Synchro Monster of a Level you could Summon when “Urgent Tuning” resolves, you must show your Extra Deck to your opponent to prove that you cannot Summon a monster. You do not have to show your Extra Deck to your opponent if you would not be able to Synchro Summon at all when “Urgent Tuning” resolves. (Because you control only 1 monster, or control only Tuner monsters, etc.)
*   You can use monsters that are not affected by Trap Cards, like “Elemental Hero Wildheart” as Synchro Material Monsters for “Urgent Tuning”.

  
## URIA, LORD OF SEARING FLAMES  
> Ⓒ This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set. Ⓢ This card cannot be Special Summoned except by sending 3 face-up Trap Cards you control to the Graveyard. ① This card gains 1000 ATK for each Continuous Trap Card in your Graveyard. ② Once per turn, you can destroy 1 Set Spell or Trap Card your opponent controls.

## VALHALLA, HALL OF THE FALLEN

However, if "Call of the Mummy" or "Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen" is already face-up on the field and its effect is activated, then "Royal Oppression" may be chained to negate the effect and destroy it.

## VAMPIRE LORD

*   Your Vampire Lord will only be Special Summoned by his own effect when destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by a card effect that your opponent controls, not by your own card effects or as a result of battle.
*   Vampire Lord will only return to play with his effect when the owner controls it, because Vampire Lord must be “destroyed and sent to YOUR Graveyard”.
*   When your opponent takes control of your Vampire Lord, and it inflicts Battle Damage to your Life Points, then the first effect of Vampire Lord is activated. But the second effect will not be activated if Vampire Lord is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard while your opponent controls him.
*   If you Summon "Vampire Lord" (except by its effect) and he is destroyed by your opponent's "Horn of Heaven" or "Solemn Judgment", "Vampire Lord" will be Special Summoned in your next Standby Phase. When it is Special Summoned by its own effect “Horn of Heaven” or “Solemn Judgment” cannot be activated, because it is being Summoned by its own Trigger Effect, not by a built-in “this is how you Summon this monster” effect.
*   When Vampire Lord is destroyed (by a card effect) while in your hand, in your Deck, or on the field, he will be Special Summoned in your next Standby Phase.
*   When Vampire Lord is Tributed (including by your opponent with Soul Exchange), or when he is “sent to the Graveyard”, he will not be Special Summoned by his own effect because he was not “destroyed”.
*   If Vampire Lord is supposed to be Special Summoned, but your Standby Phase is skipped with Solomon’s Lawbook or Gamble, Vampire Lord won’t be Special Summoned, not even on the following Standby Phase.
*   If Vampire Lord is supposed to be Special Summoned, but gets returned to your hand or Deck instead, he won’t be Special Summoned.
*   If Vampire Lord is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by your opponent’s card effect, but returns to the field that same turn and is then destroyed in a manner that would not allow him to be Special Summoned, then he is not Special Summoned.
*   You can keep Special Summoning Vampire Lord as long as each time he is destroyed by your opponent’s card effect.
*   Vampire Lord is Special Summoned to your side of the field; you cannot Special Summon him to your opponent’s side of the field.
*   When you have your Vampire Lord in play, Special Summoned by your Premature Burial or Call of the Haunted, and your opponent destroys Premature Burial or Call of the Haunted with Mystical Space Typhoon, the Vampire Lord won’t be Special Summoned because it was destroyed by your card effect, not by your opponent’s.
*   If your opponent controls your Vampire Lord with Autonomous Action Unit, and Autonomous Action Unit is destroyed, Vampire Lord won’t be Special Summoned because the owner did not control him.
*   When you Special Summon Vampire Lord with his effect, your opponent can negate the Special Summon with "Royal Oppression". Since the effect of "Vampire Lord" activates in the Graveyard, "Vampire Lord" is never moved from the Graveyard, so it is never destroyed. (A card already in the Graveyard cannot be destroyed). Because it is not destroyed, its effect to Special Summon itself does not activate again.
*   If Vampire Lord is destroyed while equipped to Relinquished, he won’t be Special Summoned, no matter who controls him or who destroyed him.
*   If Vampire Lord is destroyed while face-down by Sasuke Samurai, Vampire Lord will be Special Summoned by his effect.
*   Vampire Lord can be Special Summoned by his own effect even while Necrovalley is in play.
*   When Vampire Lord is Summoned while your opponent’s Rivalry of Warlords is active and your only monsters are non-Zombie, Vampire Lord is destroyed, but is not considered destroyed by Rivalry of Warlords’ effect and won’t be Special Summoned.
*   When your opponent doesn’t have the type of card that you declared for Vampire Lord, the effect of Vampire Lord disappears but you get to look at your opponent’s Deck to confirm it.
*   It is the controller of Vampire Lord, not necessarily the owner, that names a card type.
*   When you name “Spell” for Vampire Lord, it includes Normal, Quick-Play, Field, Ritual, Continuous, and Equip Spell Cards, and the same is true for Traps.
*   Card effects like Penguin Knight, Sword of Deep-Seated, and Cockroach Knight will activate their effects when sent to the Graveyard by Vampire Lord’s effect.

  
## VAMPIRE'S CURSE

*   You pay 500 Life Points when "Vampire's Curse" is sent to the Graveyard. Paying 500 Life Points is a cost.

## VAN'DALGYON THE DARK DRAGON LORD  
> ① After a Counter Trap Card you control negates the activation of an opponent's card(s) or effect(s), you can Special Summon this card from your hand. ② Then activate the appropriate effects, based on the type of cards negated:  
• Spell: Inflict 1500 damage to your opponent.  
• Trap: Select and destroy 1 card your opponent controls.  
• Effect Monster: Select 1 monster in your Graveyard and Special Summon it.

*   The ① optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves in the hand.
    *   This effect cannot be activated during the Damage Step \[[REF](http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?/topic/70685-vandalgyon-the-dark-dragon-lord/)\].
    *   This effect activates AFTER a Chain resolves in which an opponent's card / effect was negated (as Chain Link 1+) by your Counter Trap Card (even if you drew this card during the Chain).
    *   If you have 2 or more "Van'Dalgyon the Dark Dragon Lord" (or "Voltanis the Adjudicator") in your hand when your Counter Trap Card negates your opponent's effect, you can only activate the effect of 1 "Van'Dalgyon the Dark Dragon Lord", even if you negate multiple card effects.
    *   If your opponent discards 1 Spell Card for "Magic Drain", you cannot activate this effect.
*   The ② mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   If you activate multiple Counter Trap Cards in a single Chain, the last one to resolve is applied.
        *   Example: Your opponent activates "Card Destruction". You chain "Magic Jammer". Your opponent chains "Seven Tools of the Bandit". You chain "Curse of Royal". When the Chain resolves, "Magic Jammer" is your last Counter Trap Card that resolves and negates your opponent's "Pot of Greed", so you will be able to Special Summon "Van'Dalgyon the Dark Dragon Lord" and activate its "inflict 1500 damage" effect.
    *   If a Spell Card is negated, this effect inflicts Effect Damage.
    *   If a Trap Card is negated, this effect targets a (face-up / face-down) card your opponent controls.
    *   If a Monster Effect is negated, this effect targets a monster in the Graveyard. It is negated by "Necrovalley".
*   VS. "[Vanity's Call](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Vanity%27s_Call)": if this card negates multiple card effects controlled by your opponent, when you Special Summon "Van'Dalgyon the Dark Dragon Lord" you will activate each effect appropriate effect.
    *   Example: "Vanity's Call" negates your opponent's "Destiny Draw" and "Dark Bribe". Van'Dalgyon you will activate its "_inflict 1500 damage_" and "_destroy 1 card_" effects when Summoned. You can choose to have "_inflict 1500 damage_" be Chain Link 1 and "_destroy 1 card_" be Chain Link 2, or vice-versa.

  
## VANGUARD OF THE DRAGON

*   Sending 1 Dragon to the Graveyard is a cost to activate this monster’s effect.
*   “Vanguard of the Dragon’s” effect that Special Summons a monster is a targeted effect.
*   You can activate “Vanguard of the Dragon’s” ATK increase multiple times in the same turn.
*   The ATK increase lasts as long as “Vanguard of the Dragon” remains face-up on the field.

  
## VANITY'S CALL

*   Unless the activation of a card can be negated, the effect will not be negated either. So an effect like “Stumbling” on a chain will not be negated nor destroyed by “Vanity’s Call”.

  
## VANITY'S FIEND  
> Ⓒ This card cannot be Special Summoned. ① While this card is on the field, neither player can Special Summon monsters.

*   The Ⓒ Condition cannot be negated.

*   Drawing is optional. You can choose to send the DARK monster to the Graveyard, and then choose to not draw.
*   If the DARK monster is removed from play by "Macro Cosmos", then you cannot draw.
*   If you control two copies of "Veil of Darkness", both of them can be activated when you draw a DARK monster. However, the first copy sends the DARK monster to the Graveyard, so the second copy cannot send it to the Graveyard, so you cannot draw from the second copy.
*   If, during your Draw Phase, you draw a DARK monster because of "Reload", you can activate "Veil of Darkness". If you draw a DARK monster because of "Veil of Darkness, you can activate the effect of "Veil of Darkness" again.
*   The effect of a monster like "Sillva, Warlord of Dark World" only activates when it is "discarded to the Graveyard" from the hand by a card effect. The effects of "Hand Destruction" and "Veil of Darkness" "send to the Graveyard" the cards - this is not the same as "discard to the Graveyard". Thus, if a monster like "Sillva, Warlord of Dark World" is sent to the Graveyard by these effects, then you cannot activate its effect.

  
## VENGEFUL SERVANT

*   The effect of “Vengeful Servant” starts a chain when control of the monster switches.
*   If a Continuous Effect would destroy the equipped monster first (example: an equipped “Thunder Nyan Nyan” switches sides and is destroyed immediately), then the effect of “Vengeful Servant” does not activate and it does not inflict damage.
*   If “Remove Brainwashing” is active and a monster equipped with “Vengeful Servant” switches sides, that monster immediately switches back to the original controller.
*   The effect of “Vengeful Servant” then starts a chain (and only activates once, in this case) and the original controller of the monster takes damage.

*   "Waboku" makes Battle Damage dealt by your opponent's monsters to your monsters and to your Life Points become zero.
*   "Waboku" applies to ALL of the monsters on that player's side of the field for the entire turn.
*   To illustrate how "Waboku" works, here are some scenarios and their results:
*   SCENARIO 1: Player A's "Mega Thunderball" attacks Player B's "Mega Thunderball", and Player B activates "Waboku". RESULT: Player A's (attacking) "Mega Thunderball" is destroyed. Player B's "Mega Thunderball" (with equal ATK) is NOT destroyed.
*   SCENARIO 2: Player A activates "Waboku". Player A's "Mega Thunderball" then attacks Player B's "Mega Thunderball". RESULT: Player B's "Mega Thunderball" is destroyed. Player A's (attacking) "Mega Thunderball" is NOT destroyed. So you can use "Waboku" "offensively" when attacking an equal ATK monster.
*   SCENARIO 3: Player A activates "Waboku". Player A's "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" then attacks Player B's "Sanga of the Thunder". Player B uses "Sanga of the Thunder"'s effect (during the Damage Step). RESULT: Player A's "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (ATK 0) is not destroyed, nor does Player A lose any Life Points, because of Player A's "Waboku".
*   SCENARIO 4: Player A's "Mega Thunderball" attacks Player B's "Mega Thunderball". Player B activates "Fairy Box" or "Mirror Wall". Player A activates "Waboku". RESULT: Player A's "Mega Thunderball" (with reduced ATK) is not destroyed, nor does Player A lose any life points, because of Player A's "Waboku". But because Player A's "Mega Thunderball" had reduced ATK, Player B's "Mega Thunderball" is not destroyed either.

  
## WALL OF ILLUSION

*   If the monster battling with "Wall of Illusion" is somehow destroyed during Damage Calculation, it is sent to the Graveyard and NOT returned to the owner’s hand.

  
## WALL OF IVY

*   “Ivy Token’s” effect to inflict damage does not start a Chain.
*   If the "Ivy Token" is destroyed by a card effect, inflict damage after the effect resolves. If the "Ivy Token" is destroyed by battle, inflict damage at the end of the Damage Step, when monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the Graveyard.
*   If "Remove Brainwashing" or "Owner's Seal" is activated, control of the "Ivy Token" is shifted to the player that activated "Wall of Ivy"'s effect.

  
## WALL OF REVEALING LIGHT

*   Paying Life Points for "Wall of Revealing Light" is a cost.
*   If "Wall of Revealing Light"'s effect is negated by "Royal Decree" or "Jinzo", and then that card is destroyed, the effect of "Wall of Revealing Light" is re-applied.
*   The monsters prevented from attacking by "Wall of Revealing Light"'s effect cannot even "declare" an attack.
*   You can chain "Last Turn" to your activation of "Wall of Revealing Light" as long as "Last Turn"'s conditions are then correct (1000 or less Life Points).
*   You can activate "Wall of Revealing Light" during the Battle Step after an attack has been declared. If the monster's ATK is lower than the Life Points you paid, the attack stops (does not enter the Damage Step).

  
## WATAPON

*   If you draw "Watapon" by the effect of "Graceful Charity" you can Special Summon it to the field after you discard the two cards for "Graceful Charity".
*   "Painful Choice", "Graceful Charity", and "Witch of the Black Forest" are all examples of the types of effects that will activate the effect of "Watapon".

  
## WATER DRAGON

*   When this card on the field is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, its Optional Trigger Effect activates. You must have at least 2 “Hydrogeddon” and 1 “Oxygeddon” in your Graveyard to target, otherwise the effect will not activate. If you have 3 correct targets, the opponent can chain “Disappear” to remove from play 1 of the monsters, but the other 2 will still be Special Summoned.
*   The effect of “Water Dragon” that activates when it is destroyed targets 2 “Hydrogeddon” and 1 “Oxygeddon” in the Graveyard.
*   If you do not have 3 open Monster Card Zones after “Water Dragon” is sent to the Graveyard, you cannot activate its effect.
*   If “Water Dragon” was face-down on the field when it was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, you can still activate its effect.
*   Missing the Timing: If “Water Dragon” is destroyed by an effect in the middle of a chain, you will miss the timing and cannot Special Summon the 3 monsters from your Graveyard.
*   While “Water Dragon” is face-up on the field, either player can activate an effect to increase the ATK of a FIRE or Pyro-Type monster, but the Continuous Effect of “Water Dragon” will change it back to 0.

  
## WATER HAZARD

*   The effect to Special Summon a monster starts a Chain.
*   If the effect of “Water Hazard” activates, and an effect is Chained that gives you to control of a monster, the effect of “Water Hazard” will not be applied.

  
## WAVE-MOTION CANNON  
> ① During your Main Phase, you can send this card to the Graveyard to inflict 1000 damage to your opponent for each of your Standby Phases that have passed since this card was activated.

*   The ① Ignition-like Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Sending "Wave-Motion Cannon" to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   No Counters are involved in this card's effect. You simply count your own Standby Phase.
    *   This effect cannot be negated by "Magic Jammer", etc. Your opponent can chain "Magic Jammer" when you first activate "Wave-Motion Cannon" (when you place it face-up on the field).
    *   If "Imperial Order" is active, count Standby Phases as normal for "Wave-Motion Cannon".
    *   You can activate "Wave-Motion Cannon" (place it face-up on the field) and send it to the Graveyard during the same turn, but it will not do any damage.
    *   If "Solomon's Lawbook" skips yourStandby Phase, or the turn is skipped with "Gamble", increase the count for "Wave-Motion Cannon" anyway. "Pyro Clock of Destiny" will not increase the count.

  
## WEAPON CHANGE

*   "Weapon Change" applies to the current ATK & DEF.
*   "Weapon Change"'s effect targets 1 monster. You select the monster when you activate "Weapon Change"'s effect.
*   If you use "Weapon Change"'s effect on "Freed the Matchless General", "Weapon Change" is destroyed.
*   Even if the selected monster's Type is changed by "DNA Surgery", the monster receives the effect of "Weapon Change".
*   If "Weapon Change" is removed from the field by "Giant Trunade" or "Emergency Provisions", "Weapon Change"'s effect is not applied.
*   If "Imperial Order" is activated after "Weapon Change", "Weapon Change"'s effect is negated, but if "Imperial Order" is destroyed, then "Weapon Change"'s effect is re-applied.
*   If you switch a monster's ATK/DEF with "Weapon Change", and then apply a new modifier, apply it to the switched ATK/DEF. Then, after "Weapon Change"'s effect ceases, re-apply the modifier to the reverted ATK/DEF once again.
*   If you use "Weapon Change" to make "Gear Golem" into a 2200/800 monster, then use "Limiter Removal" to make it 4400/800, then destroy "Weapon Change", "Gear Golem" is 800/4400.

  
## WEEPING IDOL

*   This is an Ignition Effect that activates in the hand. Removing from play 1 Tuner monster in your Graveyard is a cost.

  
## WHIRLWIND WEASEL

*   After “Whirlwind Weasel’s” Flip Effect has resolved, the effects of already face-up Spell and Trap Cards, like “Ultimate Offering”, can still be activated.
*   The effects of Spell and Trap Cards that activate when the card is destroyed, such as “Blast with Chain” or “Ojamagic” will also still be activated. (In other words, you cannot activate a card, but you can activate an effect.)

  
## WHITE MAGICIAN PIKERU

*   Monster tokens and face-down monsters are included for "White Magician Pikeru"'s effect.
*   Even if there are many monsters, "White Magician Pikeru" increases Life Points by 1 lump sum.
*   "White Magician Pikeru" includes itself in its effect.
*   If you resolve "White Magician Pikeru"'s effect and then in the same Standby Phase the number of monsters on the field increases, you don't get additional Life Points.

  
## WHITE NIGHT DRAGON  
> ① Negate the activation of any Spell or Trap Card that targets this card, and destroy that card. ② When a face-up monster you control is selected as an attack target, you can send 1 Spell or Trap Card you control to the Graveyard to change the target to this card.

*   The ① Quick Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   This effect can be activated on either players turn, and even in the Damage Step.
    *   This effect can be activated more than once in a Chain.
*   The ② optional Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.
    *   Sending a Spell or Trap Card to the Graveyard is a cost.
    *   This effect does not target.
    *   If you control your opponent’s monster with “Snatch Steal” while you have “White Night Dragon” in play and your opponent attacks the equipped monster, if you send “Snatch Steal” to the Graveyard to change the attack target no replay occurs.
    *   If this effect is negated by “Skill Drain,” a replay occurs.

  
## WHITE POTAN

*   If “White Potan” becomes a Tuner, it cannot be destroyed by battle.
*   If a monster being treated as a Tuner is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, it is not considered a Tuner in the Graveyard, and the effect of “White Potan” to inflict damage will not activate.

  
## WICKED REBIRTH

*   Paying 800 Life Points is a cost to activate “Wicked Rebirth.”
*   This card targets the Synchro Monster, both when you activate this card and while the monster is on the field.
*   If “Royal Decree” becomes active while “Wicked Rebirth” is active, the Synchro Monster’s effect is restored, and it can attack this turn.
*   If you Special Summon “Stardust Dragon” with “Wicked Rebirth,” you can Tribute “Stardust Dragon” for its effect. After it is Tributed, “Stardust Dragon” is no longer targeted by “Wicked Rebirth.” Therefore its effect is restored and applied normally (so it negates an effect and is Special Summoned back to the field during the End Phase).
*   The Special Summon of “Wicked Rebirth” is not a Synchro Summon, so it cannot be used to Special Summon monsters like “Trident Dragion.”

  
## WICKED-BREAKING FLAMBERGE - BAOU

*   Sending 1 card to the Graveyard is a cost. This is not "discarding" so it doesn't trigger "Forced Requisition", and you can pay the cost even if "Goblin of Greed" is in play.
*   If a monster equipped with "Wicked-Breaking Flamberge - Baou" attacks and destroys "Amazoness Fighter" or "Amazoness Swordswoman", their effects are not negated because they happen during damage calculation, before they are determined to have been destroyed.

  
## WIDESPREAD DUD

*   “Widespread Dud” targets the 2 face-up monsters. The effect to destroy the targeted monsters does not start a Chain.
*   If “Enemy Controller” is Chained to “Widespread Dud” and shifts one of the targeted monsters to face-up Defense Position, “Widespread Dud” will still resolve normally.
*   Even if one of the targeted monsters is changed to Defense Position after “Widespread Dud” resolves it will still be affected by “Widespread Dud.”
*   If “Book of Moon” is Chained to “Widespread Dud” and flips one of the targeted monsters face-down, only the other one will continue to be targeted.
*   After “Widespread Dud” resolves, when one of the targeted monsters is removed from the field “Widespread Dud” is destroyed and the other monster is destroyed.

  
## WILD FIRE

*   You cannot activate this card if you do not control a “Blaze Accelerator” card.
*   You cannot activate this card if there are no monsters on the field.
*   If there are no monsters on the field when “Wild Fire” resolves, you cannot Special Summon any Tokens, but you can declare an attack that turn.
*   You cannot activate "Wild Fire" if you are prevented from Special Summoning monsters, due to an effect like "Scapegoat".
*   If you activate "Wild Fire" the effect that you cannot declare an attack affects you, the player, so even a monster that is unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards like "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6" cannot attack.
*   You can activate "Royal Oppression" in a chain to "Wild Fire".
*   "Blaze Accelerator" is destroyed when "Wild Fire" resolves. If an effect is chained that removes "Blaze Accelerator" from the field, "Wild Fire"'s effect disappears and you can attack that turn.

  
## WILD NATURE'S RELEASE

*   When you increase the ATK of a monster with "Wild Nature's Release", then apply another modifier, the new modifier is applied to the current ATK points.
*   If "Ojama Yellow" is equipped with "Axe of Despair" (1000 ATK, 1000 DEF), if "Wild Nature's Release" is activated then it increases "Ojama Yellow" to 2000 ATK, 1000 DEF. If "Axe of Despair" is then destroyed, "Ojama Yellow" remains 2000 ATK, 1000 DEF.
*   If a monster is affected by "Wild Nature's Release", and its Type is then changed with "DNA Surgery", the effect of "Wild Nature's Release" is not negated and the monster is still destroyed during the End Phase.
*   If you activate multiple "Wild Nature's Releases", the effects are cumulative.

  
## WINGED KURIBOH

*   If “Winged Kuriboh” is destroyed as a result of battle, its effect will not reduce the Battle Damage its owner takes from that battle, because its effect doesn’t activate until later, when it’s sent to the Graveyard. (And damage calculation has already happened by then.)
*   If “Winged Kuriboh” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, its effect activates and applies for the rest of the turn, even if “Winged Kuriboh” is removed from play with “Disappear”, or shuffled back into the Deck with “Fiber Jar”.
*   Because the effect of “Winged Kuriboh” activates in the Graveyard, it will not be negated by “Skill Drain” but it will be negated by “The End of Anubis”.
*   Because the effect of “Winged Kuriboh” activates in the Graveyard, it is the original owner that will get the effect. So if the opponent took control with “Change of Heart” or “Snatch Steal”, if it is destroyed then it goes to the original owner’s Graveyard and they get the effect.
*   When “Winged Kuriboh” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, the activation of its effect can be chained to.
*   After the effect of “Winged Kuriboh” resolves, the application of the effect (making Battle Damage zero) does not start a chain and cannot be chained to.
*   If “Winged Kuriboh” is treated as an Equip Card (like if it’s equipped to “Relinquished”) and it’s destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, its effect still activates.
*   If your opponent takes control of your “Winged Kuriboh” and when it tries to return to your control you have no open Monster Card Zones, “Winged Kuriboh” is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, and its effect activates.

  
## WINGED KURIBOH LV10

*   “Winged Kuriboh LV10's” effect is a Quick Effect. You cannot activate this effect during the Damage Step.
*   The Quick Effect of “Winged Kuriboh LV10”can be chained to. You can chain “Barrel Behind the Door” or “My Body as a Shield” to the effect.
*   Tributing “Winged Kuriboh LV10” is a cost to activate its effect.
*   The “combined original ATK” of the destroyed monsters is calculated after the monsters are destroyed and are no longer on the field. So a destroyed “King of the Skull Servants” would add 0 damage to this effect, and a destroyed “Fusilier Dragon – the Dual Mode Beast” that was Summoned without Tribute would add 2800 damage.
*   You cannot activate “Level Up!” to send “Winged Kuriboh LV10” to the Graveyard because it does not have a monster’s name in its text.
*   You may return “Winged Kuriboh LV10” from your Graveyard to your Deck with the effect of “The Graveyard in the Fourth Dimension”.
*   If an opponent’s monster cannot be destroyed by the effect of “Winged Kuriboh LV10”, no damage is dealt for that monster’s ATK. For example, if “Master Monk” targeted by “Lone Wolf” is on the field, it is unaffected by monster effects, so it will not be destroyed and its 1900 original ATK points will not be inflicted to its controller.
*   You can activate the effect of “Winged Kuriboh LV10” if “Skill Drain” is on the field, and its effect will resolve normally and not be negated, because it is no longer a face-up monster on the field.

  
## WINGED MINION

*   If the Fiend-Type monster that received the ATK and DEF increase from this card’s effect is flipped face-down, the effect is reset and the ATK and DEF return to the original amounts.
*   You may Tribute two "Winged Minions" to increase the ATK and DEF of a Fiend-Type monster by 1400 points.
*   If the Fiend-Type monster that was selected for this card’s effect is changed into a different Type, by the effect of "DNA Surgery" for example, it retains the 700 point ATK and DEF increase.

  
## WINGED RHYNOS

*   This effect cannot be chained to the activation of the effect of an already face-up Continuous Trap Card, like "Ultimate Offering". It can only be chained when a Trap Card itself is activated (ie., flipped face-up).
*   This effect is a Spell Speed 2 Quick Effect. Therefore, it cannot be chained to the activation of a Counter Trap Card.
*   This effect can be activated multiple times in the same chain, but only once for each Trap Card activated.

  
## WITCH DOCTOR OF SPARTA

*   If 2 or more monsters are Special Summoned by the same effect, “Witch Doctor of Sparta’s” effect will only activate once and it will inflict 500 points of damage.

  
## WITCH OF THE BLACK FOREST

*   You must show your opponent the monster you select from your Deck for this card’s effect. If you have no eligible monsters, your opponent gets to see your Deck to verify.
*   The effect of "Witch of the Black Forest" only activates when she is sent from the field to the Graveyard, not from your hand or Deck, and not if she is removed from play.
*   If the Summon of this card is negated with "Horn of Heaven" or "Solemn Judgment" you do not get its effect.
*   If you control your opponent’s "Witch of the Black Forest" and it is destroyed, your opponent gets the effect since it activates in his/her Graveyard.
*   You can chain to the activation of "Witch of the Black Forest"’s effect.

  
## WITCH OF THE BLACK ROSE

*   “This card cannot be Special Summoned” is not treated as an effect.
*   If you have no cards in your Deck when you activate the effect of “Witch of the Black Rose,” you will lose the Duel.
*   If you activate the effect of “Witch of the Black Rose” while you have no cards in your hand and you draw “Infernity Archfiend,” you can activate the effect of “Infernity Archfiend.” You resolve the effect of “Witch of the Black Rose” like this: -Draw 1 card. If it is a monster, the effect is over. -If not, destroy “Witch of the Black Rose” and send the card drawn to the Graveyard. (Destroying and sending the card occur at the same time.)

  
## WOLF IN SHEEP’S CLOTHING

*   You activate this card after damage calculation.
*   Revealing 1 Level 1 monster from your hand is a cost.
*   If a monster is reduced to Level 1 while it’s in your hand, you can reveal it for “Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing” and Special Summon monsters of the same name from your Deck.
*   If “Mystical Space Typhoon” is Chained to “Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing” and destroys that card that is changing the Level of your in-hand monster to 1, the effect to Special Summon will still resolve.
*   If you only have 1 Monster Card Zone open when this card resolves, you choose which of the two monsters to Special Summon, and the other one goes to your Graveyard.
*   If an effect is Chained that removes the card you revealed from your hand, the effect to Special Summon will not be resolved.
*   You cannot activate “Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing” if you don’t have a monster in your Deck of the same name as a Level 1 monster in your hand.
*   The card you reveal is revealed until “Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing” is completely resolved.

  
## WONDER CLOVER

*   Sending a Plant from your hand to the Graveyard is a cost to activate “Wonder Clover.”
*   “Wonder Clover” targets 1 monster you control.
*   Monsters that are unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards, like “Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6,” can still attack even if “Wonder Clover” is preventing other monsters from attacking.
*   You cannot target a monster with “Wonder Clover” if it is already affected by a card like “Twin Swords of Flashing Light – Tryce.”
*   If “Imperial Order” is activated, you still cannot attack with other monsters.

  
## WOODLAND ARCHER

*   Tributing this monster is a cost.

  
## WOODLAND SPRITE

*   "Woodland Sprite" gives you the ability to send Equip Spell Cards equipped to it to the Graveyard. Sending them to the Graveyard for this specific purpose is the only way to activate the effect and inflict 500 points of damage to your opponent.
*   This card’s effect can only be activated during your Main Phase, but may be activated more than once per turn.
*   An Equip Spell Card sent to the Graveyard by this card’s effect is not "destroyed". So the effects of "Butterfly Dagger – Elma", "Axe of Despair", "Malevolent Nuzzler", "Blast with Chain", or "Smoke Grenade of the Thief" cannot or will not be activated.
*   If you send "Black Pendant" to the Graveyard with this card’s effect, the effect of "Black Pendant" will activate, because it does not have to be "destroyed", just sent to the Graveyard.
*   You can activate "Premature Burial" to Special Summon "Woodland Sprite" from your Graveyard, and then its effect to send "Premature Burial" to the Graveyard and "Woodland Sprite" will remain on the field. This is because "Premature Burial" was not destroyed.
*   If you opponent activates "Snatch Steal" and equips it to your "Woodland Sprite", they may choose to activate its effect and send "Snatch Steal" to the Graveyard. You will take 500 damage, and then control of "Woodland Sprite" would return to you.

  
## WRATH OF NEOS

*   “Wrath of Neos” targets 1 face-up monster named “Elemental Hero Neos” you control.
*   You can activate “Wrath of Neos” and target a Token or “Embodiment of Apophis” being treated as “Elemental Hero Neos” by "Hero Mask." If you target a Token, you cannot return it to the Deck or destroy all cards on the field. If you target “Embodiment of Apophis,” you can return it to the Deck and destroy all cards on the field.
*   If your opponent gains control of “Elemental Hero Neos” targeted by “Wrath of Neos” before it resolves, you still return that card to your Deck and destroy all cards on the field.

  
## WROUGHTWEILER

*   The effect of “Wroughtweiler” targets.
*   If the necessary 2 cards are not in the Graveyard when the effect of “Wroughtweiler” resolves, the effect disappears. Even if the effect cannot resolve, it still starts a chain.

  
## WYNN THE WIND CHARMER

*   If your opponent chains “Enemy Controller” to the activation of the Flip Effect of a “Charmer”, and takes control of the “Charmer”, the Flip Effect disappears.
*   If you take control of the opponent’s monster with a “Charmer” and the opponent takes control back with “Change of Heart”, control still reverts to you after the effect of “Change of Heart” expires (even though it wasn’t your monster originally).
*   If your opponent takes control of your monster with “Snatch Steal”, and you activate the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to take it back, you keep control while the “Charmer” is face-up on the field.
*   If “Book of Moon” is chained to the Flip Effect of a “Charmer” to flip the target monster face-down, the effect of the “Charmer” disappears.
*   If a “Charmer” is removed from play with “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, its effect is not re-applied when it’s back on the field.
*   If “DNA Transplant” changes a monster’s Attribute so that it can be taken by a “Charmer”, and then “DNA Transplant” is destroyed so that the monster’s Attribute no longer corresponds to the effect of the “Charmer”, the controller of the “Charmer” loses control of the monster.
*   If the turn player controls a “Charmer” and a monster controlled by its effect, and activates “Assault on GHQ” and targets the controlled monster, and the opponent chains an effect to destroy the “Charmer”, the controlled monster returns to the opponent’s control, but is still destroyed by the effect of “Assault on GHQ”.

  
## XING ZHEN HU

*   You can chain one of the 2 Spell or Trap Cards on the field to the activation of "Xing Zhen Hu". However, the remaining one will not be able to be activated after "Xing Zhen Hu" resolves.
*   If neither of the targeted Spell or Trap Cards is on the field when "Xing Zhen Hu" resolves, then "Xing Zhen Hu" remains on the field meaninglessly.
