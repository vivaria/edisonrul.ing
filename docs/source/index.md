# Yu-Gi-Oh! Edison Rulings

This website contains the rulings for both [https://www.edisonformat.com/rulings](https://www.edisonformat.com/rulings) and [https://edisonformat.net/card](https://edisonformat.net/card):

- **Edisonformat.com**: Pre-UTW, historical rulings written by Upper Deck Entertainment circa 2010 and compiled in 2021.
- **Edisonformat.net**: Post-UTW, up-to-date rulings written by Mika and eva to reflect present-day Konami rulings at high-profile Edison events, including Edison-accurate problem solving card text.

When there is a rulings conflict, please refer to the **Edisonformat.net** rulings. If the **Edisonformat.net** section is missing rulings, please fall back to the historical UDE rulings listed under the **Edisonformat.com** section.

The goals of **Edisonrul.ing** are as follows:

- Fast search for individual card pages, as well as mentions of cards in other cards' rulings.
- Easy to share links.
- Proper attribution of rulings (whether UDE or Edisonformat.net)
- Transparent comparison between historical rulings and updated rulings.
