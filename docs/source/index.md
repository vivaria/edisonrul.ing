# Yu-Gi-Oh! Edison Rulings

This website contains the text of [Edisonformat.com](https://www.edisonformat.com/)'s [Individual Card Rulings](https://www.edisonformat.com/rulings), updated to make it easier to navigate. This website is easily searchable, and links to individual cards can be shared on Discord, DuelingBook, etc. You can also download a PDF or EPUB copy of this site using the button in the top-right for easy offline viewing (e.g. for judging events with spotty internet).

If you come across any errors or missing details, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/vivaria/edisonrul.ing/issues/new) on GitHub. Or, if you'd like, you can open a pull request with your proposed changes. Rulings are stored as easy-to-read Markdown, and each page contains a link at the bottom to edit the source, so let's come together as a community and create the best rulings site we can for Edison. :)

> Note: The individual card rulings on this site were compiled from the archived UDE Gameplay FAQ database \[[REF](https://web.archive.org/web/20090217182013/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/yugioh/en/gameplay/faqs/cardfaqs/default.aspx?first=A&last=C)\] and the Konami Card Rulings documents \[[CRMS](https://ms.yugipedia.com//1/11/Card_Rulings_-_Crimson_Crisis_v2.0.pdf), [RGBT](https://img.yugioh-card.com/uk/gameplay/rulings/RGBT_rules.pdf), [ANPR](https://img.yugioh-card.com/uk/gameplay/rulings/ANPR_rules.pdf), [SOVR](https://img.yugioh-card.com/lat-am/pt/gameplay/rulings/SOVR_sneak_ruling.pdf), [ABPF](https://img.yugioh-card.com/uk/gameplay/rulings/ABPF_rules.pdf), [HA01](https://img.yugioh-card.com/uk/gameplay/rulings/100304%20HA_SDWS_ST09_Rules.pdf), [SDMM](https://img.yugioh-card.com/lat-am/gameplay/rulings/10406SDMachinaMayhem_Rules.pdf)\]. Notable cards have streamlined rulings and additional information cross-referenced against Pojo / Duelistgroundz.
