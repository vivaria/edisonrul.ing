# Yu-Gi-Oh! Edison Rulings

## Overview

This website contains the rulings for both [https://www.edisonformat.com/rulings](https://www.edisonformat.com/rulings) and [https://edisonformat.net/card](https://edisonformat.net/card):

- **Edisonformat.com**: Pre-UTW, historical rulings written by Upper Deck Entertainment circa 2010 and compiled in 2021.
- **Edisonformat.net**: Post-UTW, up-to-date rulings written by Mika and eva to reflect present-day Konami rulings at high-profile Edison events, including Edison-accurate problem solving card text.

When there is a rulings conflict, please refer to the **Edisonformat.net** rulings. If the **Edisonformat.net** section is missing rulings, please fall back to the historical UDE rulings listed under the **Edisonformat.com** section.

## Goals

The goals of **Edisonrul.ing** are as follows:

- Fast search for individual card pages, as well as mentions of cards in other cards' rulings.
- Easy to share links.
- Proper attribution of rulings (whether UDE or Edisonformat.net)
- Transparent comparison between historical rulings and updated rulings.

## Requesting a change

As this website contains scraped text, there may be minor formatting issues or outdated rulings. If you encounter any mistakes, please contact me on Discord (username: `_vivaria`) and I will be happy to update any mistakes.

You may also contact me about missing rulings, and I will do my best to work with active judges to add them. If possible, please first ask your question in the `#rules-question` channel of the [Edisonformat.com Discord server](https://discord.gg/U9SAc3ZB). Then, after you have been provided with a conclusive ruling, please share a link to the discussion as part of your request. That way, I can attach a reference to any modifications I make to a card's page.

If you would like to see the history of changes made to this website, please take a look at the Git commits for the [**`cards` folder**](https://github.com/vivaria/edisonrul.ing/commits/main/docs/source/cards) or the [**site as a whole**](https://github.com/vivaria/edisonrul.ing/commits).
